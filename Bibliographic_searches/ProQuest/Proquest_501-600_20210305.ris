T1  - Freeze tolerance adaptations in the centipede Lithobius forficatus
AN  - 304100816
AB  - Studies were conducted to investigate the adaptations of the wood centipede, Lithobius forficatus, to winter conditions. In winter centipedes are freeze tolerant. However, inoculative freezing initiated from environmental ice was required for survival of freezing. Because the lower lethal temperature (after 24 hours exposure) is only $-6\sp\circ\rm C,$ it appears that the insulation provided by the overwintering microhabitat under large logs is important for survival. Freezing proved lethal to summer animals.    Inoculative freezing points of live specimens remained steady at approximately $-1\sp\circ\rm C$ throughout the year, as did the melting points of hemolymph. Although the supercooling points of the hemolymph stayed roughly constant at $-7$ to $-9\sp\circ\rm C,$ those of live animals rose in winter and decreased in summer, suggesting the presence of non-hemolymph ice nucleators in winter. However, inoculative freezing was still essential for freeze tolerance. Centipedes did not accumulate carbohydrates or polyols in winter.    Winter hemolymph showed marked recrystallization inhibition activity, indicating the presence of thermal hysteresis proteins, while summer hemolymph did not. However, only occasional individuals had measurable thermal hysteresis activity in winter, indicating that the hemolymph concentration of thermal hysteresis proteins is low.    A suspension of live gut cells from Lithobius was used to evaluate the effect of thermal hysteresis protein on freeze tolerance. $\rm LT\sb{50}$ values of approximately $-12$ and $-8\sp\circ\rm C$ were obtained from cells harvested from animals collected in winter and summer respectively. The addition of thermal hysteresis protein in concentrations of 0.02 mg/ml lowered both summer and winter values to about $-14\sp\circ\rm C.$ Higher concentrations were detrimental to survival. Rinsing the thermal hysteresis protein from the medium after prior incubation did not effect the level of freeze protection and the Dendroides protein was shown to bind to the centipede cells. Also, thermal hysteresis protein protected cells from recrystallization damage.    Antibodies to thermal hysteresis protein obtained from the beetle Dendroides canadensis cross reacted with protein on the surface of gut cells. Likewise, the antibodies cross reacted with proteins in winter, but not summer, collected Lithobius hemolymph.

T1  - Adaptations to subzero temperature in fire-colored beetle larvae, Dendroides canadensis (Pyrochroidae): Re-analysis and integration
AN  - 304100588
AB  - Overwintering insects adapt behaviorally, physiologically and biochemically to survive subzero temperatures. Some species survive extracellular freezing (employ a freeze tolerant strategy). Others die if frozen (they are freeze susceptible), and therefore must become freeze avoiding. Dendroides canadensis switch between freeze tolerant and freeze avoiding strategies. This study explored cues for interannual switches in overwintering strategy and mechanisms for freeze avoidance in the Pyrochroid beetle larvae, Dendroides canadensis.    Correlative field data from years with contrasting severity of winter onset link a severe onset (early onset of autumn subzero cold snaps with subzero temperatures persisting thereafter) with increased hemolymph ice nucleator activity. During laboratory acclimations mimicking a severe (but not during a mild) winter onset, de novo nucleative freeze tolerance was induced.    During spring through early autumn, larvae are highly susceptible to inoculative freezing from environmental ice, but by midwinter become highly resistant. Inoculative freezing may be adaptive since early autumn larvae survived an inoculative (but not nucleative) freeze. In vivo experiments and in vitro Ussing chamber studies suggest that seasonal modifications in the integument (possibly epicuticular lipids) and in colligative and thermal hysteresis protein (THP) antifreezes of the hemolymph contribute to the greater resistance of cold hardy larvae to inoculative freezing. Although imunocytochemical studies clearly indicate more abundant epidermal THPs in winter, results did not implicate the epidermis in seasonal increases in inoculative freezing resistance.    Hemolymph and gut fluid supercooling capacity (SCC) increase seasonally in years when the larvae are freeze avoiding. Gel filtration chromatography, flotation ultracentrifugation and quantitative analysis of ice nucleator activity using hemolymph from warm and cold acclimatized larvae strongly suggest that removal of highly active lipoprotein and protein hemolymph ice nucleators, combined with masking of ice nucleators by endogenous hemolymph THPs, contributes to increased SCC. The winter increase in gut fluid SCC results from evacuation of bacterial ice nucleators, combined with masking of ice nucleators by endogenous gut fluid THPs.    Additionally, an ice nucleation active bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, was isolated from D. canadensis gut fluid and lipoprotein and protein ice nucleators were isolated from larval hemolymph.

T1  - Developmental changes in resistance of mammalian embryos to elevated temperature and strategies to improve fertility in dairy cattle during heat stress
AN  - 304091189
AB  - Embryos gain resistance to adverse effects of heat stress as development progresses. The primary goals of this dissertation research were to identify the ontogeny of thermal resistance in mammalian embryos and identify systems to limit effects of heat on bovine embryo survival. In the first study, embryonic survival was decreased in cows heat-stressed on d 1 of pregnancy but not on d 3, 5 or 7 of pregnancy, implying that embryos gain increased thermal resistance by d 3 of pregnancy. The developmental resistance of embryos to heat was verified by exposure of bovine embryos to elevated culture temperatures (i.e., heat shock). Subsequent in vitro development was decreased for 2-cell bovine embryos but not for bovine morulae exposed to 41 C for 3 h. The acquisition of intracellular processes which confer thermal resistance was investigated by determining the ontogeny of induced thermotolerance in murine embryos (i.e., ability of embryos to resist a severe heat shock by prior exposure to a mild heat shock). Induction of thermotolerance was observed between the 8-cell and blastocyst stage for murine embryos, suggesting that intracellular thermoprotective mechanisms are acquired during embryonic development.    Two strategies for limiting effects of heat stress on bovine embryos were examined. Pregnancy rates were slightly improved in cows exposed to short-term cooling from 2 to 3 d before until 5 to 6 d after breeding. Two molecules, glutathione and taurine, reduced heat shock effects on viability and/or development of cultured bovine and murine morulae but did not reduce heat shock effects on cultured 2-cell bovine embryos.    In conclusion, embryos gain resistance to elevated temperatures as development progresses, probably through acquisition of intracellular thermoprotective mechanisms. Pregnancy rates were improved in cows by short-term cooling. However, glutathione and taurine could not protect embryos during initial stages of development from the adverse effects of elevated temperature.

T1  - The effects of temperature and time of first feeding on egg and fry development in atlantic salmon, salmo salar l
AN  - 301583401
AB  - The first part of this study investigated the effects of varying temperature regimes within the range of 8-22°C on the development and survival of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) eggs and alevins. The temperature tolerance of eggs was lower than that of alevins: egg mortality increased above 11°C and no eggs survived to eyeing or to hatching at 16 and 14°C, respectively; alevin mortality increased above 16°C and no alevins survived at 22°C. Optimal survivals of eggs and alevins occurred at 8-11°C and 10-14°C, respectively. Subsequent survival at later stages of development was largely determined by survival at earlier stages. Developmental abnormalities among eggs (pin-eyed eggs) and alevins (abnormal hatching and yolk-sac oedema) appeared to be temperature-dependent. Development time in days from fertilisation to eyeing, hatching and maximum alevin wet weight (MAWW) varied inversely with temperature. The sum of degree-days from fertilisation to eyeing and to MAWW was similar at all temperatures, but declined with increasing temperature from eyeing to hatching. The hatching period was similar for all temperatures except 8°C where it was significantly longer. Although alevin size at hatching was not temperature-dependent within the range of 8-12°C, alevin size at MAWW decreased progressively with increasing temperature (10-20°C) during the alevin stage. Fry size at first feeding did not affect their subsequent growth rate or survival. Advanced fry which were fed earliest grew at similar rates to those produced at lower temperatures and attained the greatest weight. Biomass gain was more dependent upon survival than upon mean fish weight. The second part of this study investigated the effects of timing of first feeding on fry growth and survival. Alevins fed prior to final yolk resorption were larger and had lower mortalities than those fed after MAWW. Although the "window" of first feeding opportunity lasted several weeks, delaying feeding beyond MAWW reduced absolute growth. A 5-week delay led to mortalities approaching 60%. However, first feeding can be delayed beyond MAWW for 1-2 weeks at 10°C without adversely affecting subsequent survival or growth rate.

T1  - Survival of pathogenic yeasts in the sea.
AN  - 301538730
AB  - Over a twelve-month period, yeasts were isolated from the Tay estuary and Candida albicans was identified along with possible isolates of the common marine yeast Debaryomyces hansenii.  Peak population levels at each site were obtained during the warmer months of May through to September, in the range of approximately 3 to 16 colony forming units (cfu) per litre of seawater, as compared to winter averages of approximately 1 to 4 cfu.1-1.  Viable cells of C.albicans were obtained after incubation at 10, 25 and 37oC in sterile seawater for a period of eight weeks.  The energy source for survival may well have arisen from the degradation of reserve storage compounds, for example trehalose and glycogen.  Organic solutes accumulated in the presence of seawater were glycerol, arabitol, mannitol and trehalose.  This was also true for cells grown in Minimal Salt Medium (MSM) with glucose as a carbon source.  Toxicity tests in solid medium carried out on C. albicans 3153A and isolates from the Tay estuary found inhibition of growth at an external NaCl concentration of greater than 3 M.  Preadaption of these cells did not result in an increase in tolerance of the organism, or a substantial difference in the organic compatible solute levels accumulated.C.albicans was sensitive to low temperature.  Reduced cell numbers were obtained for cells incubated in both MSM and seawater at 10oC in comparison with those incubated at 24 and 37oC.  During exponential growth, C. albicans 3153A accumulated the organic compatible solute glycerol as a result of exposure to elevated external osmotic pressure.  The accumulation of a secondary compatible solute, arabitol, during the stationary phase of growth was also observed.

T1  - Specialists and generalists in changing environments: The evolution of thermal sensitivity
AN  - 304091364
AB  - Temporal variation in the physical environment limits the ability of animals to perform fitness-enhancing activities, such as growth, mating, and oviposition. The organism's sensitivity to these environmental changes can be described by a performance curve, a plot of performance against an environmental variable. I address two questions in the evolution of performance curves. First, what is the optimal performance curve for a given pattern of environmental variation? Second, how does the genetic variation for the performance curve evolve? I use the thermal sensitivity of insect locomotion as a model system to develop theory to address these questions, and to empirically examine the key assumptions of the models.    I developed optimality and quantitative genetic models of the evolution of the performance curve. The models measure fitness as fecundity or mating success, and examine what phenotypes are favored under different combinations of cyclic within-(WG) and among-generation (AG) environmental variation. WG variation tends to reduce the fitness differences among phenotypes, and AG variation alone favors broader performance curves. In combination, WG and AG variation interact to allow the evolution of specialists, with narrow performance curves, even in the most variable environments.    Increasing the amplitude of fluctuations in the environment helps maintain genetic variation in the performance curve. The rate of performance curve evolution, however, is much slower than anticipated. Non-linear performance curves and reaction norms impose functional constraints that limit the efficacy of selection in moving a population towards its fitness optimum, thereby slowing the rate of evolution.    The key assumption in these models is a trade-off between maximum performance rate and the breadth of performance. This "jack-of-all-trades is master of none" constraint has rarely been tested. I quantified the trade-off at both the genetic and phenotypic levels in the parasitic wasp, Aphidius ervi, and at the phenotypic level in Drosophila melanogaster. Strong evidence for the "jack-of-all-trades" was found at the phenotypic level in both species, and genetic trade-offs were found in male A. ervi. Parental and developmental temperature effects on the adult locomotory performance curves in Drosophila were also examined; developmental temperatures have the greatest effect on adult performance.

T1  - Development of an on-site gas chromatography/mass spectrometer for rapid detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls at hazardous waste sites
AN  - 304086718
AB  - Analytical methods for the on-site qualitative analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) using a mobile thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (TDGC/MS) have been developed and evaluated. PAH's and PCB's were analyzed in the field by two methods: analyte measurement from organic extract analysis prepared from non-aqueous solid wastes and soils and from soil/sediment media directly. These methods have been used to separate and identify the PAH's and PCB's through solvent extraction followed by thermal desorption, or by direct thermal desorption from the soil matrix into a fused silica capillary column containing a slightly polar stationary phase. The eluting analytes were identified through selected ion monitoring (SIM) or total ion current chromatogram (TIC) by matching the masses and relative abundances of the fragments to values stored in the memory of the MS system.    Through these experiments, the applicability of laboratory analytical techniques to in-field analysis was evaluated. The selectivity and sensitivity of the mobile TDGC/MS toward the target PAH and PCB analytes were assessed both in the laboratory and on-site within the complexity of environmental samples. The evaluation experiments determined the instruments detection parameters and limitations including dynamic range, sensitivity, limits of detection, and degree of isobaric interferences.    Quantitation of the PAH and PCB analytes was accomplished by using response factors by internal standard measurements. The TDGC/MS responded linearly over three orders of magnitude with a minimum detection limit of less than 1 ng for each PAH and PCB thermally desorbed as an organic liquid, and 25 ng directly desorbed from a soil matrix. The method used was capable of giving near real-time analysis in about 5 minutes. Confirmation studies were performed using standardized EPA methods and laboratory based gas chromatography/flame ionization detection (GC/FID), gas chromatography, electron capture detection (GC/ECD), and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).    This field analytical method was tested in the field by comparing split sample field results with those of independent EPA certified contract laboratories. The results of these comparisons showed that the field methods yielded data within the limits of EPA's criteria of acceptability for remediation purposes. In addition, the field data offered on-site immediate turnaround results for site assessment facilitating the mapping of sampling locations, hazard determination, and immediate steps toward remediation.

T1  - A multifactor investigation of the reproductive fitness responses of the land snail Neohelix (=Triodopsis) albolabris to levels of temperature, humidity, nutrition, calcium, and parasitism, by the nematode Parelaphostrongylus tenuis
AN  - 304072801
AB  - Ecosystems are collections of abiotic and biotic factors, hierarchically arrayed, and inclined toward interaction. The actions and interactions of ecological factors are fundamental in the determination of individual fitnesses and thus the selection pressures for the evolution of life histories for an ecosystem's organisms. Confronted with the multifactor structure of an ecosystem, a multifactor experimental design would thus seem requisite for the elucidation of the mechanisms of an ecosystem.    Experimental multifactor environments of five factors (parasite burden, temperature, humidity, nutrition, and calcium) at three levels were used to produce life history data in an investigation of the extant reproductive fitness variations for the land snail Neohelix (= Triodopsis) albolabris. First through third stage larvae (L$\sb1$-L$\sb3$) of Parelaphostrongylus tenuis (Nematoda: Metastrongyloidea) commonly infect N. albolabris in its natural habitat and were used for the parasite burden in the present study.    Life history responses of the snails to the levels of environmental factors indicated significant variation in the number and quality of their eggs and offspring. Additionally, levels of abiotic factors within the environment of the host influenced the rate of nematode development, and thus the magnitude of the infective parasitic populations. Two life history patterns were observed corresponding to the relative amount of environmental stress.    Environments favoring increases in adult snail activity, egg and hatchling energy, and hatchling growth rates contained low levels of environmental stress. Factor combinations benefiting environmental tolerance allowed snails to accrue energy from foraging and to channel energy into life history functions. Parasitic populations competed for nutrient-derived snail energy, and their effects were somewhat offset by favorable host environmental tolerance and nutritional levels. Larval development rates were enhanced by low temperature and high nutrition host environments.    Stressful conditions for the experimental snails occurred within environments reducing the acquisition of nutrition and thus energy for life history functions. In stressful environments snail reproductive effort was characterized by delayed oviposition of large clutches with high hatching success, but also high hatchling mortality and lower hatchling growth rates. The higher mortality and lower early growth rates infer limited energy resources partitioned from stressed adults into their eggs.

T1  - Specificity in the Gregarine assemblage parasitizing Tenebrio molitor
AN  - 304068657
AB  - Gregarina niphandrodes Clopton, Percival and Janovy, 1991, Gregarina cuneata Stein, 1848, Gregarina polymorpha (Hammerschmidt, 1838) Stein, 1848, and Gregarina steini Berndt, 1902, constitute the gregarine assemblage parasitizing the yellow mealworm, Tenebrio molitor. Comparative life cycle studies were conducted across several ontogenetic stages to provide an illustration of the nature of host specificity in the gregarine life cycle. Reciprocal cross-stadium experimental infections demonstrated that G. cuneata, G. polymorpha, and G. steini are restricted to larval T. molitor and G. niphandrodes are restricted to adult T. molitor. The exogenous developmental niches of G. niphandrodes, G. cuneata, and G. polymorpha were determined along temperature and humidity axes and associated with parasite niche space on the host resource axis. Gregarine gametocysts were incubated at controlled humidity (0, 10, and 20 mm Hg vapor pressure deficit) at 20, 25, 30, and 35 C to determine the environmental limits to survival and sporulation. Although the environmental conditions that permit gametocyst developmental overlap, G. niphandrodes utilize a subset of sporulation and survival conditions that are incompatible with the developmental needs of G. cuneata and G. polymorpha. Likewise, G. cuneata and G. polymorpha survive and sporulate under a subset of environmental conditions that are incompatible with the developmental needs of G. niphandrodes. The pattern of interspecific variation in the environmental tolerances of gregarine gametocysts is analogous to the pattern of interspecific variation in host stadium specificity observed in endogenous gregarine stages. The oocysts of G. niphandrodes, G. cuneata, and G. polymorpha were tested for variation in viability over time, variation in post-sporulation development, and for host stadium specific physiological cues that initiate exsporulation. There are no interspecific differences in oocyst viability over time, post-sporulation developmental timing in the oocyst, nor in the physiological cues that initiate oocyst exsporulation in the host gut. There is no evidence to suggest that any of these phenomena play a role in host stadium specificity. These results are interpreted within the context of Chabaud's host capture hypothesis.

T1  - Environmental factors affecting the montane range of red spruce
AN  - 304065370
AB  - Red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) is a dominant tree species in regions having cool-temperate rainforest climates. These areas extend from the upper elevations of the Appalachians to the northeastern parts of Maine and New Brunswick and are characterized by perhumid moisture regimes and low potential evapotranspiration rates. Within these regions, the occurrence of red spruce is further modified by additional factors, giving it a unique distribution when compared with otherwise sympatric species. This paper examines some of the major components which define the range of red spruce in the montane spruce-fir forests of the Appalachian mountains.    Several experiments were conducted to examine the extent to which temperature extremes and mist presence and chemistry affect the physiology and biochemistry of montane red spruce. Various aspects of the trees biology are discussed in relation to its range. High temperature effects were examined directly by raising temperatures in small cuvettes. Branch sized environmental exclosures were developed to examine the affect of cloudwater and air chemistry on mature, montane trees. Pruning experiments were used to explore the consequences of injury to branch development.    In summary, the lower elevational and latitudinal boundaries for red spruce occur at the 27$\sp\circ$C mean summer maximum isotherm. The results of the cuvette heating study support this observation, as the trees experience poor carbon gain above 30$\sp\circ$C. The northern and upper elevational boundaries occur where the mean winter low is 40$\sp\circ$C. Pests, pathogens and competition probably have not greatly influenced the range of red spruce. In particular, the species' shade tolerance and strong historical presence in hardwood forests suggest that competition has not played a role. In the montane and coastal regions, the frequent occurrence of clouds or fogs does not appear to be vital based on the data collected. This interpretation is, however, limited to the effect of cloudwater interception. Cloud chemistry is important to the trees' physiology. The presence of acidic cloudwater alters the pigment content of shoots and affects winter hardiness and susceptibility to winter injury. Selective pruning indicated that injuries affecting buds had the most serious consequences for branch architecture.

T1  - Nesting ecology and reproductive correlates in the desert-nesting gray gull Larus modestus
AN  - 304049924
AB  - During the 1991-92 breeding season, the largest known active nesting colony of gray gulls Larus modestus in the Atacama Desert of Chile consisted of 2930 nesting pairs. Nest dispersion was clumped, facilitating group defense against avian predators. Clutch size, which averaged 1.56 eggs with relative frequencies of 0.44, 0.55 and 0.01 for one-, two- and three-egg clutches, was similar to other colonies throughout the Atacama. Egg volumes were similar to those in other colonies. First-laid eggs were larger (48.9 cc) than second-laid (45.5 cc) and single eggs (47.5 cc). Mean incubation time differed significantly between first- (28 days) and second-laid (29 days) eggs. Single eggs required 28 days to hatch. Hatching success was higher in two-egg (0.90) than single-egg (0.67) nests. Overall, 1.6 hatchlings were produced per nest, 4042 for the colony. Chicks from single-egg nests grew faster than those with nest mates, demonstrating food restriction effects imposed by the single daily foraging flight by their parents to the coast 15 km away.    Egg temperature during incubation ranged from 30$\sp\circ$C, during the night (24:00-02:00 h) when eggs were exposed while nesting adults interacted with their mates which had returned from foraging, to 39$\sp\circ$C, when adults stood during the day (14:00-16:00) for convective thermoregulation. Chicks developed thermoregulatory ability 5 days post hatching, coincident with the time when both adults began to forage at the coast. Chick thermal neutral zone was between 25$\sp\circ$ and 40$\sp\circ$C, somewhat higher than for other larids. Thermal tolerance of embryos (17$\sp\circ$-41$\sp\circ$C) was similar to other seagulls.

T1  - A climatology of leads in Arctic sea ice in winter, derived from satellite imagery
AN  - 304032863
AB  - The existence of leads (linear openings) in sea ice is important climatologically, oceanographically, and geophysically. However, the present knowledge on their occurrence and development is quite limited. The purpose of this research is to reveal and explain the geographic distribution of large leads in Arctic sea ice, using satellite and associated environmental data. The region and season of interest is the imagery western Arctic during the winter half-year, November through April.    A five-year record, 1979-1985, is derived from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program imagery. Leads are mapped from thermal- and visible-band image transparencies at 10-day intervals. The occurrence (density) and orientation of leads are derived from these maps and gridded in 2$\sp\circ$ x 10$\sp\circ$ cells. The overall mean and the interannual, seasonal, and monthly variability of these lead parameters are estimated, and their relationships to ice motion parameters are assessed. Then, the development of leads and lead fields is observed and related to synoptic-scale pressure systems.    The density of winter leads in the study area is found to be highest in the central Canada Basin, and lowest in the East Siberian Sea. Lead densities decrease about 20% throughout the winter, probably due to increased resistance in the thickening ice pack. There is considerable variability in the spatial patterns of lead occurrence, and the interannual variability is on the same order as the seasonal and monthly variability. Preferred lead orientations are identified: generally north-south in the Beaufort Sea sector and east-west in the East Siberian Sea sector, with northwest-southeast orientations in the intermediate area.    It is observed the mean lead density is positively correlated with mean ice divergence on a similar scale, and mean lead orientation is correlated with mean shear orientation, with a 90$\sp\circ$ rotation angle. The development of leads and lead fields is associated with synoptic-scale wind forcings, though the exact nature of the relationship remains speculative. The results of this research indicate that knowledge and understanding of lead distributions can contribute to a greater understanding of sea ice dynamics and relationships to climate.

T1  - Some factors affecting survival and distribution of arctic charr (salvelinus alpinus (l.)) in windermere
AN  - 301442016
AB  - A literature review and a summary of previous work on Windermere charr are presented.  Given the pressures cultural eutrophication may exert on charr, the major objectives are:-  to compare the tolerance of different life stages of charr to varying levels of temperature and oxygen;-  to monitor the numbers and distribution of charr in both basins of Windermere, using long-term catch data and echo-sounding.  Experimental work was performed on three life stages (alevins, fry, parr) of each of the four known races of Windermere charr.  There were significant differences in egg size and alevin length and weight between autumn and spring spawners.  All other experimental work did not reveal differences between races.  Temperature tolerance experiments showed that alevins were the least tolerant of the life stages to elevated temperatures.  The effects of acclimation temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20oC) were more marked for alevins than fry or parr.  Arctic charr are the least resistant of salmonids to elevated temperatures.  Oxygen tolerance experiments showed alevins were less tolerant than parr to low oxygen levels.  At lower acclimation temperatures, parr tolerated lower oxygen levels than at higher acclimation temperatures.  Arctic charr parr are the most tolerant of salmonids to low oxygen levels.  Monitoring of charr populations in Windermere by three methods (gill-netting, anglers' catches, echo-sounding) provided comparable data on fluctuations in charr stocks.    Echo-sounding also provided monthly fish density estimates for 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992 during day and night surveys in the north and south basins.  Differences in methodology for abstracting density estimates are discussed. Maximum densities were used to obtain pelagic fish population estimates.  Results reflected fish behaviour.  Good correlations were obtained between fish distribution and oxygen levels during autumn stratification.  Finally, the more general implications of this investigation are discussed, with special emphasis on the conservation and management of Arctic charr populations.(DX176024)

T1  - Productivity and community structure of mangroves of Libertad, Misamis Oriental
AN  - 2202080986
AB  - A study on the productivity and community structure of mangroves of Libertad, Misamis Oriental was conducted in December 1992. The community structure was determined using the transect line plot method. Light attenuation method using LI-COR 189 quantum meter was employed for estimating potential net primary productivity. The remaining total mangrove area in Libertad has reduced to 4 hectares from the 1969 estimate of 17 hectares due to the development of government infrastructures and construction of human settlements. Six species of mangroves belonging to four different families were identified, Sonneratia alba as the predominant species followed by the Rhizophora species. Average tree density was 145 trees per hectare and sampling density was 46 per hectare while seedling density was 13 per hectare. Species diversity was less with low species richness (6 species). Distribution of trees follow a uniform pattern while saplings and seedlings exhibit a contagious distribution pattern. Occurrence and zonation scheme of the mangrove species somehow affected by several factors like the distribution of sediments, salinity tolerance, tide flooding and the destruction of the resources by human activities. Salinity, temperature and pH of soil and water were 41.75ppt; 31.75 ~'C; 6.91 and 40.25ppt; 32.50 ~'C ; 7.93, respectively. Potential net primary productivity of the Libertad mangrove area was relatively low with a value of 12.92 kg C/hectare/day or equivalent to 4.72 kg C/hectare/year due to the disturbed condition of the area.

T1  - Temperature and phenotypic plasticity in lizards
AN  - 304023342
AB  - This dissertation investigates the role of environmental temperature in the elicitation of an acclimatory response, and thus phenotypic plasticity, in lizards. Two species of lizard were studied; the desert night lizard (Xantusia vigilis) and the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis). In Xantusia vigilis, adult and juvenile individuals were maintained under different temperatures and subsequent measurements of sprint speed, critical thermal limits to performance and preferred body temperature were made. Neither sprint speed or its thermal dependence were modified over intermediate test temperatures for all treatment groups. However, performance at the terminal test temperatures as well as the critical thermal limits to locomotion and the preferred body temperature shifted toward the experimental treatment temperatures. The degree of this shift was generally greater with juveniles rather than adult animals. To investigate the role of lizard development and thermal acclimation, eggs of Sceloporus occidentalis were incubated under different temperatures and the morphology and physiological performance of the resultant hatchlings measured. Despite a highly significant effect of incubation temperature on time to hatching, the hatchlings displayed little incubation-induced variation in morphology, other than a slight shift toward smaller hatchlings with increasing incubation temperature. Locomotor endurance, critical thermal limits to locomotion, and temperature preference did not shift with incubation temperature. The results of these studies suggest that at least for some aspects of locomotor performance, the significant variation observed in lizards in nature may partly be due to variation in the thermal environment. However, these results also suggest that morphological variation observed in natural lizard populations is most likely due to genetic factors, or environmental factors other than temperature.

T1  - Ecology and comparative demography of the lizard Sceloporus grammicus: Life history of an altitudinal generalists on the eastern slope of the Iztaccihuatl Volcano, Puebla, Mexico
AN  - 304011575
AB  - Population studies on the high altitude lizard Sceloporus grammicus were conducted using mark-recapture methods on two study sites located at 3,700 m elevation (low altitude site) and 4,400 m elevation (high altitude site), on the eastern slope of the Iztaccihuatl Volcano, Puebla, Mexico, over a four year period to assess differences in thermal biology, growth rates, and demographic characteristics. Regardless of contrasting differences in environmental conditions between study sites, individual lizards maintained similar active body temperatures, growth rates, and population parameters.    Active body temperatures at both study sites were approximately 32$\sp\circ$C. However, individual lizards at the low elevation site showed a greater resistance to high temperatures than individual lizards at the high elevation site. Acclimation to higher environmental temperatures at the low elevation site may explain the greater heat tolerance.    Females in both populations grew slower and attained asymptotic sizes earlier in life than males (0.0025 mm per day and 49.7 mm snout-vent length for females vs 0.0027 mm per day and 53.2 mm snout-vent length for males). Growth rates of neonates were between 0.10 and 0.15 mm per day in both sexes and sites. Differential cost of thermoregulatory behavior, and differences in the number of predators and competitors between study sites are possible explanations for similar growth rates at both sites.    Individual lizards at both study sites attained maturity at about 14-15 months of age. Females body size at this age was about 39-40 mm at both study sites. Females produced a single litter per year and litter size depended on female body size. Females at low elevation produced an average 3.64 $\pm$ 0.10 young per litter and at high altitude 3.31 $\pm$ 0.129 young per litter. Survivorship was slightly greater at the low elevation site, however, average survivorship for all years of data combined was not significantly different between study sites. Two different predation indices, percentage of broken tails and flushing distance, were greater at the low elevation site than at the high elevation site.    Biotic factors reflected in higher syntopic competitors and higher predation indices appear to be responsible for population regulation at the low elevation site. Abiotic selective factors, especially low temperatures and shorter growing seasons, probably regulate population size at the high elevation site.

T1  - Environmental influences on the critical oxygen tension, water balance, metabolism, and growth of reptilian embryos
AN  - 303997842
AB  - The effect of hypoxia on gas exchange of reptilian embryos was studied. Embryos of Alligator mississippiensis, Caretta caretta, Pseudemys nelsoni, Elaphe obsoleta quadrivittata, and Sceloporus undulatus undulatus maintained normal levels of oxygen consumption, V$\sb{\rm O\sb2}$, to some degree of hypoxia, indicating that they are metabolic regulators. A low V$\sb{\rm O\sb2}$ and a high eggshell conductance for O$\sb2$ explain how reptilian embryos maintain their V$\sb{\rm O\sb2}$ in hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic tolerance decreased during incubation, as indicated by an increase in the critical oxygen tension, P$\sb{\rm c}$. The P$\sb{\rm c}$ increased presumably because oxygen transport capacity, reflected by the critical oxygen gradient, G$\sb{\rm c}$, did not offset the increase of V$\sb{\rm O\sb2}$ during development.    Embryos of the Florida red-bellied turtle, P. nelsoni, were used as model organisms to further examine environmental influences on gas exchange and physiological responses of embryos to hypoxia and flooding. Oxygen consumption and P$\sb{\rm c}$ of embryos were significantly affected by temperature. The Q$\sb{10}$ values remained the same (Q$\sb{10}$ = 2-3) at different incubation days, thus indicating that the thermal sensitivity of metabolism does not change during development. The P$\sb{\rm c}$ was temperature-dependent and increased in direct proportion to temperature at each incubation day. Oxygen consumption and P$\sb{\rm c}$ of embryos were not affected by egg hydration. Eggs incubated in 13% gravimetric water content gained mass at a faster rate than those in 3% gravimetric water content, and the respective egg masses were statistically different at day 30 and 39. However, oxygen consumption, critical oxygen tensions, and hatchling mass of the two groups were not different. Exposure to chronic hypoxia (10% air) resulted in retarded growth, depressed metabolism, and reduced hatchling mass but comparable incubation period and hatchability. Embryos are flexible, structurally and physiologically, in enhancing oxygen transport to compensate for hypoxic effects. Simulated flooding has dramatic effects on water balance, embryonic metabolism and development of embryos. One-day submergence in water did not affect water balance and oxygen consumption of embryos, but did increase egg mortality. On the other hand, 3- and 6-day submergence treatments affected water balance, oxygen consumption and hatching success of eggs.

T1  - Effects of incubation conditions on sex, survival and growth of hatchling snapping turtles Chelydra serpentina (Linne)
AN  - 303996394
AB  - I tested the hypothesis that larger egg and hatchling sizes in the snapping turtle are correlated with higher posthatching survival and growth, mediated by the effects of the thermal and hydric environments during embryonic development.    Embryo and hatchling mortality were higher in clutches from two sites which are relatively highly contaminated with organochlorine toxins. Hatchlings from the site near the northern limit of the species' range grew the slowest. Clutch identity was a highly significant factor for all variables. Initial egg mass and substrate moisture were positively correlated with mass at hatching, but not with hatching success (in the first study), nor with posthatching growth and survival in both studies.    Results support the Charnov-Bull model. Hatchling mortality was very high among turtles from eggs incubated at 21.1$\sp\circ$C. This suggests that cold incubation temperatures, which predominate in turtle nests at northern sites, may limit the species' range by causing high embryonic mortality and poor hatchling quality.

T1  - The chemical ecology of Aedes sierrensis, the western treehole mosquito
AN  - 303985676
AB  - Aedes sierrensis (Diptera: Culicidae) is the most abundant treehole mosquito in California, and Lambornella clarki (Ciliophora: Tetrahymenidae) its most important natural enemy. Populations of L. clarki are induced to parasitism by a larval cue which may be exploited in the biological control of Ae. sierrensis by L. clarki.    Larval feeding rates and diet mediated production of the short-lived induction cue; larvae fed penicillin or nutritive substrates induced a greater parasitic response than larvae fed inert substrates or starved larvae. Induction activity was concentrated in, but not restricted to, the larval gut.    Homogenates of non-host dipteran larvae induced a parasitic response, but only mosquito larvae excreted the cue into their habitat. The parasitic response of L. clarki populations, proportional to the concentration of induction cue, was saturated at high larval densities. Induction of L. clarki laboratory cultures was correlated with treehole flooding history, but not with densities of natural larval populations.    Gel filtration chromatography produced a high molecular weight fraction with high induction activity. Solubility properties, heat lability and papain catalysis indicated that the cue is a dietary protein. Lambornella clarki exploits an induction cue directly linked to larval predation.    Tannins in treehole habitats may regulate mosquito production and disease transmission. Aedes sierrensis populations produced adults over a wide range of tannin concentrations. Tannin concentration had limited influence upon adult size and sex ratio in laboratory and field experiments. Under field conditions, dissolved tannins slowed developmental rates of larvae, but adult eclosion tracked environmental stimuli.    Tannin tolerance by laboratory cultures of L. clarki was restricted, relative to its host. Lambornella clarki of three geographic strains were induced to parasitism at tannin concentrations which killed most cells. The parasitic response of L. clarki to high concentrations of tannins may provide a refuge within Ae. sierrensis larvae.    Tannin concentrations in natural treehole water varied with time since treehole flooding, precipitation and evaporation. Under field conditions, tannin concentration influenced mosquito development more than food allocation, the presence of L. clarki, or any combination of these variables; adult numbers, developmental rate, sex ratio and male winglength were significantly influenced by tannin concentration in this study.

T1  - An investigation into the development of upland and lowland tadpoles of the common frog (Rana temporaria) and common toad (Bufo bufo) when cultured at different temperatures
AN  - 2114562999
AB  - Frog and toad tadpoles were collected from two lowland (altitude <100m) and one upland (altitude >100m) pond and cultured at temperatures of 5 C, 8 C, lO C, 15 C and 25 C and their mean development stage recorded at regular intervals. Upland frogs developed faster than upland toads from 5 C to 10 C but upland toads developed more rapidly from 15 C to 25 C. It is suggested that upland toads have evolved through natural selection to develop faster at these higher temperatures to compensate for the shorter growing season available to them in the wild. Lowland frogs developed faster than lowland toads at 15 C but at all the other culture temperatures there were no significant differences between the two populations. Upland frogs and toads exhibited equal development rates at 25 C which was the only temperature at which the development rates of these two cultures overlapped. Upland toads grew more quickly than lowland toads at 15 C and 25 C and it is hypothesised that upland toads are adapted to grow faster than their lowland counterparts to compensate for the fact they are laid later in the Spring and have to develop at a lower temperature. The mortality of both upland and lowland toads is greater than upland and lowland frogs at the temperature extremes of 5 C and 25 C. Frog tadpoles may therefore be better able to withstand lower temperatures because they spawn earlier in the year and thus their tadpoles normally experience lower temperatures than those of toads and have therefore evolved to tolerate such conditions.

T1  - Cold hardiness and cold hardening of the beech weevil Rhynchaenus fagi and the housefly Musca domestica.
AN  - 900221663
AB  - The current classification system of insect cold tolerance divides species into those that can survive the partial freezing of body water, known as freezing tolerant, and those for which this occurrence is lethal, termed freeze avoiding.    The cold hardiness of two temperate insects was studied, the beech leaf mining weevil  Rhynchaenus fagi , and the house fly  Musca domestica , by determination of the freezing temperature, and survival after extended exposure to low temperature.  No adult weevil recovered after cooling to below the freezing point; however, although the freezing temperature of cold hardened adults was consistently below -20oC, no weevil survived two weeks at a constant -15oC.  Similarly, weevils exposed to + 10oC also exhibited high mortality, with 58&37 dying after nine weeks.  This species insect therefore displays pre-freeze mortality (cold shock); since it is implicit in the definition of freeze avoiding species that the individual should survive until freezing occurs, the weevil cannot be termed freeze avoiding.  Glycerol was the only cryoprotectant observed to vary significantly, levels typically rising from 24.2<IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/mu.gif">g/mg dry weight in weevils collected from overwintering sites in early November, to 67.4<IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/mu.gif">g/mg DW in weevils sampled in January, and to 41.6<IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/mu.gif">g/mg DW after 16 weeks at a constant &43 2oC.  Thermal hysteresis proteins were not detected in haemolymph samples.    The novel `rapid cold hardening response', in which tolerance to a previously lethal cold shock can be conferred by a short acclimation period, eg. 30min at 0oC, was studied in the housefly  Musca domestica .  When pharate adult  M.domestica  were transferred directly to -7oC for 2h, none of the pupae subsequently produced adult flies; however, if the pupae were prior acclimated at 0oC for 3 h, emergence of `normal' flies was not significantly different from the uncooled controls.  The increased cold tolerance is however of limited extent; for instance 2h at -11oC or 10h at -7oC.  Whilst the cold tolerance is quickly lost on return to favourable conditions, the response may enable individuals with incomplete cold hardiness to tolerate early and late frosts by tracking diurnal temperature fluctuations.

T1  - Effect of temperature/photoperiod on sorghum resistance mechanisms to biotype C and E greenbugs (Homoptera:Aphididae), and biotype differentiation by DNA content
AN  - 304015874
AB  - The effect of temperature and photoperiod on tolerance, antixenosis, and antibiosis of sorghum lines resistant to biotype C (Tx2737 and Tx2783) and biotype E (Tx2783) greenbugs at 21, 26, and 30$\sp\circ$C, and 10L:14D and 14L:10D was determined using the sorghum line Tx430 as a susceptible check. Damage to resistant sorghum lines was less than to the susceptible check (usually about ${1\over2}$ as much). Tolerance resistance was at least twice as great on the resistant sorghums at 30$\sp\circ$C than at 21 or 26$\sp\circ$C. The level of antixenosis resistance was less than that of tolerance resistance. At 21 and 26$\sp\circ$C, the resistant sorghum lines were as preferred as the susceptible sorghum line. Antixenosis resistance was greatest at 30$\sp\circ$C. Greenbug development and reproduction was affected by temperature and resistant sorghum lines. Days from birth to maturity was greatest at 21$\sp\circ$C, but was equally as long at 30$\sp\circ$C on the resistant sorghums. Progeny production was severely reduced by the resistant sorghum lines, especially at 30$\sp\circ$C. At 30$\sp\circ$C, greenbugs reproduced three times fewer progeny on the resistant sorghums than on the susceptible sorghum. Greenbug longevity was shorter at 30$\sp\circ$C than at 21 and 26$\sp\circ$C, but resistant sorghums had a greater effect, further reducing longevity. Photoperiod did not appear to affect the level of the three resistance mechanisms. These data confirm the importance of temperature in assessing resistance mechanisms and support the contention that temperature should be a consideration in all resistance assessment research.    Difference in cellular DNA content between biotype C and E greenbugs was not great; however, for all experiments, biotype E greenbugs cellular DNA content averaged about 1.05 pg/cell while that of biotype C greenbugs was 1.02 pg/cell. The significance of this difference is unknown. Greenbugs reared on sorghum had lower amounts of DNA (0.99, 1.03, and 1.07 pg/cell) for biotype C, biotype E, and field collected biotype E, respectively, compared to the same biotypes of the greenbug on wheat and johnsongrass. The range of DNA content in greenbugs was 0.91-1.24 pg/cell, and the mean over all experiments was 1.06 pg/cell. These results suggest that the use of flow cytometric DNA analysis should be further tested as a possible means of rapid greenbug biotype identification.

T1  - Fluctuations in abundance of burrowing mayflies in southern Indian Lake, Manitoba: Mechanisms and implications for environmental monitoring
AN  - 303967434
AB  - The major factors affecting the population dynamics of Hexagenia in SIL during the study period were related to weather variables, primarily water temperature during development (and its relationship to air temperature during the open water period) and weather conditions wind, air temperature) during the emergence period. The two species in the lake, H. limbata and H. rigida, approach their northern range limit at or near SIL. Their life cycles were similar to the study regions and closely related to thermal regime. After emergence, transformation to the adult (imago) stage was dependent on air temperatures.    Size of nymphs at maturity was related to thermal regime and the length of the life cycle. Mean body length of mature nymphs declined with decreasing thermal regime in the lake regions where 3-yr life cycles predominated. Body size in the female was strongly correlated to fecundity.    The link between nymphal development and temperature was confirmed in laboratory studies. Growth and development was also affected by food availability: nymphs reared under limiting food conditions took longer to develop and adults were smaller and less fecund than those reared under non-limiting food conditions. Nymphal rearing density, at levels ranging from 215 to 1290 nymphs/m$\sp2$, had no significant effect on growth.    Egg hatch was related to temperature. Fewer eggs hatched and the time required for hatch was extended at the lower temperatures. Egg hatching success was improved by subjecting eggs to cold temperatures (4$\sp\circ$C) during development.    Abundance and distribution of nymphs in the lake was related to thermal regime. The greatest abundance was noted in the warmest locations, and numbers declined with decreasing temperature. Temperature affected abundance through its effects on life history parameters: lower relative temperatures resulted in longer life cycles and higher accumulated mortality, fewer eggs hatching, and delayed emergence with a higher probability of temperature- or storm-related impacts on emergence and molting.    Between-year weather differences should result in similar weather-related fluctuations in abundance as were noted between regions, and two consecutive very cold years (1978 and 1979) coincided with the inception of hydroelectric development. Over the 15-yr monitoring period, $\approx$95% of the variation in whole-lake abundance of burrowing mayflies (R$\sp2$ =.947) could be explained by air temperature. Therefore, the overall decline in Hexagenia numbers, originally thought to be anthropogenic, was more likely a response to weather.    Regionally, however, the Hexagenia response to air temperature was not uniform throughout the lake. Abundance declined in all areas following the cold years of 1978 and 1979, but subsequent recovery in the latter regions was delayed or arrested because of a permanent diversion-related lowering the water temperature.

T1  - Genetics and ecology of an invading species: Bythotrephes cederstroemi in western Lake Erie
AN  - 303963892
AB  - When assessing invasions of communities by exotic species, one may approach the phenomenon from two perspectives: the autecology of the invader or the invasibility of the community. The former approach was used to examine the invasion of Lake Erie by the Palearctic cladoceran Bythotrephes cederstroemi. Successful invasion of Lake Erie by Bythotrephes would require overcoming obstacles such as low genetic variability due to bottlenecks, challenges from abiotic factors such as water temperature, and competition with ecologically-similar native species. Genetic variation was assessed using cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis to survey genetic variation of Bythotrephes in North American and European populations. To determine life history characteristics, population demographics, and thermal sensitivity of Bythotrephes and the native cladoceran Leptodora kindti, thermal tolerance experiments were combined with field collections made from 1986-89. Food-limited competition with Leptodora was estimated indirectly by analysis of demographic characteristics and correlations with prey abundance. Newly-established North American populations of Bythotrephes do not have lower genetic variation than long-established European populations, leading to the conclusion that North American populations have not passed through a genetic bottleneck in the course of their invasion. Warm summer temperatures of western Lake Erie are associated with low fecundity in Bythotrephes, with Leptodora is well-adapted to these conditions and acclimates to temporal changes in water temperature. Temperature may also indirectly affect abundance by affecting predation rates, with Bythotrephes apparently more vulnerable to predation. Abundance and fitness of Bythotrephes and Leptodora are not tightly correlated with prey abundance. Although Bythotrephes has been able to overcome a number of obstacles, the harsh thermal environment and heavy predation pressure of the western basin of Lake Erie have resulted in Bythotrephes being an ephemeral member of this zooplankton community.

T1  - In vitro propagation of penaeid cells: Development of a medium based on biochemical analysis of shrimp hemolymph and examination of methods to evaluate growth of cells in culture
AN  - 303958410
AB  - One of the major obstacles to the diagnosis of penaeid viral diseases is the lack of an optimum cell culture system that would support the replication of baculoviruses and infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV). In the initial stages of this investigation, several commercial media formulations were utilized for the in vitro growth of shrimp cells. Lack of success in cultivating penaeid cells prompted this investigation to undertake a one year study to quantitatively analyze twenty separate biochemical markers in shrimp hemolymph. Data obtained from the biochemical analysis was applied to the formulation of a growth medium (with 2x L-15 as the basal medium) which was used in the establishment of primary cultures from various shrimp tissues. Hemocytes from Penaeus vannamei and P. aztecus were evaluated for their seeding efficiency, frequency of contamination with microbial pathogens, surface charge(s), temperature tolerance, susceptibility to baculovirus and IHHNV, etc. Electrofusion of hemocytes, SF-9, and MOT cells were conducted in three fusion media and critical voltage (V$\sb{\rm cr}$) was determined. Shrimp hemocytes were electrofused with SF-9 or MOT cells and hybrid formation and viability of the cells were confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy and dye exclusion technique.

T1  - Environmental factors and production characteristics affecting the culture of red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus
AN  - 303935477
AB  - Experiments with red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus, were conducted to assess environmental requirements and culture characteristics. Pond trials were used to evaluate the effects of salinity, chloride source, predator control, acclimation procedure, stocking density, and size at stocking on production. Survival in individual ponds ranged from 0-92%; average daily weight gain from 0.46-2.22g; and feed conversion ratio from 2.30-4.90. Survival, growth, and feed conversion ratio did not differ significantly between equivalent treatments in saltwater and freshwater ponds. The minimum chloride concentration necessary for acceptable production of red drum in freshwater ponds (250-300 mg/l) was at least 100% higher than the concentrations reported to support high survival and growth in some laboratory experiments. Mortality in ponds could be attributed to hypoxia, handling and stocking stresses, and vertebrate predators. A laboratory experiment was designed to determine the dissolved oxygen tolerance of juvenile red drum in relation to temperature and salinity. Fingerling red drum acclimated to combinations of 0.5 and 5 ppt salinity and 25 and 30 C survived to low dissolved oxygen concentration (0.34 mg/l) when concentration was reduced over several hours, as might occur in culture ponds. No difference due to temperature or salinity was detected in resistance to hypoxia. Red drum survived to significantly lower mean dissolved oxygen concentration when rate of deoxygenation was reduced. Results of these experiments indicate that red drum can be successfully cultured if water quality, predation, and handling stresses are controlled.

T1  - Life histories and thermal relationships of stoneflies (Plecoptera) in two Utah spring streams
AN  - 303932277
AB  - Thermal cues characteristic of many lotic environments are not found in springs. This study examines stonefly life histories in relationship to the stenothermal conditions characteristic of springs. Both the eucrenon and the hypocrenon populations of a desert spring stream (Clover Creek) and a sub-alpine spring stream (Vivian Park) were investigated to compare the effects of different temperature regimes upon their life cycles.    Zapada cinctipes displayed a univoltine slow cycle. Nymphal growth was closely related to the summation of degree-days. Upon eclosion, it grew more rapidly in Station 3 where there was a greater number of degree-days, but in the winter period it grew more rapidly in Station 2, nearer the spring, due to greater degree-days in this station. Smaller nymphal sizes at the Vivian Park stations may be due to increased competition from additional euholognathans and other detritivores not present in Clover Creek. The lowest recorded acute thermal tolerance for Zapada cinctipes was 18.0$\sp\circ$C (72-h LT50) using Probit analysis. It appeared to be more susceptible to increased temperatures at or near the time of molting.    Hesperoperla pacifica exhibited a non-seasonal merovoltine cycle of 4 years at Clover Creek Spring, Vivian Park Spring and at the South Fork of the Provo River. Incubation of the eggs required about 12 months followed by three years in nymphal growth and development.    Sweltsa coloradensis occurred at all five collecting stations although rarely in Vivian Park Spring. It exhibited a "split-cohort." Part of the cohort displayed a univoltine slow cycle and the other a semivoltine cycle at Clover Creek stations. It exhibited a univoltine slow cycle in the South Fork of the Provo River.    Isoperla fulva is believed to exhibit a univoltine slow cycle in the Clover Creek spring-brook, but with a few stragglers being semivoltine. The life cycle is complicated by non-synchronous egg hatching. Continuous recruitment by eclosion caused a wide variation in size distribution. Emergence outside of the normal period occurred.    A contribution from this study was the discovery of the large number of life cycle options exhibited by the stoneflies in non-thermal springs and spring-brooks.

T1  - Aspects of the biology of Sacculina carcini (Crustacea: Cirripedia: Rhizocephala), with particular emphasis on the energy budget.
AN  - 301536686
AB  - The biology of Sacculina carcini, a parasite on the common shore crab, Carcinus maenas, was studied with particular emphasis on larval morphology, biochemical content and energetic demands.  The prevalence and distribution of the parasite was also investigated.  The field studies carried out on the populations of S.carcini on C.maenas in northern France and North Wales, together with a review of the literature, demonstrated a disparate distribution.  The larvae of S.carcini are lecithotrophic and can develop within 5 days to the cyprid and are capable of settlement 2 days later.  The highest prevalence for the parasite was observed to correlate with semi-enclosed bodies of water.   It is proposed that in this situation, with the short development time, the larvae are retained, thus increasing the probability of successful cypris settlement.  Such coastal systems are susceptible to variable conditions, consequently experiments were undertaken to investigate the larval tolerance to temperature and salinity variations.  A morphological study was carried out on the naupliar stages of S.carcini.  The typical cirripede limbs were simple and lacked gnathobases.  There was also a vestigial ventral thoracic process present in the stage III and stage IV nauplius.  These observations supported the argument that the rhizocephalan nauplius fits within the cirripede nauplius form.  The energy budget study involved the investigation of ash-free dry weights per larva, respirometry for each larval stage and analyses of the biochemical constituents using colorimetric and gravimetric techniques.  Finally an equation was developed which demonstrates the energy budget for S.carcini, from the beginning of larval development to settlement on the host and the subsequent metamorphoses to the inoculation stages.

T1  - The lethal and sub-lethal effects of low temperatures on insects.
AN  - 301396734
AB  - Laboratory maintained nymphs and adults of an anholocyclic clone of the cereal aphid Sitobion avenae were cooled to a series of sub-zero temperatures for brief exposure periods (cold-pulses).  The longevity of both nymphs and adults was reduced significantly in relation to decreasing temperature (-5 to -10oC) and increasing period of exposure (1 to 6 h).  Acclimation to nymphs at 10oC increased survival and longevity compared to nymphs reared at 20oC.  The daily fecundity of aphids that survived to the adult stage after cooling as nymphs was unaffected by cold exposure but total fecundity was reduced, being a function of decreased longevity.  The fecundity of aphids cooled as pre-reproductive adults was significantly reduced, indicating that low temperature affects embryo development.  Adults cooled to -5oC for 6 h produced few nymphs, all of which died within 48 h of birth, showing that low temperature also has a pre-natal affect on mortality.    Sub-lethal exposure of nymphs to low temperature (-5oC for 3 h) caused a significant reduction in the proportion of alate adults.  The youngest first instar nymphs appeared to be most sensitive to this effect and pre-natal cold-pulsing also suppressed wing development.  Crowding of nymphs (a factor known to induce wing development) after low temperature exposure did not override the alate suppression.    The separate and interacting effects of temperature and photoperiod on cold tolerance were also investigated in this aphid.  Aphids reared at 10oC were significantly more cold hardy than individuals reared at 20oC.  Photoperiod did not influence cold hardiness at 20oC, but short photoperiods appeared to limit the acclimation response at 10oC.  A rapid cold hardening response was observed in S. avenae.  Acclimation at 0oC for only 3 h reduced mortality significantly (compared to unacclimated samples) after a direct transfer to -7oC for the same period.  The increased cold tolerance was lost as rapidly as it was gained, but aphids were able to `re-harden' at daily intervals.  Importantly, rapid cold hardening also occurred during slow cooling, suggesting that the response may be an aid to survival under field conditions.  (D79508)

T1  - Studies on the effects of serveral husbandry variables on the rearing of shrimp, Penaeus monodon, larvae.
AN  - 900239964
AB  - The effects of several husbandry variables:  environmental rearing conditions (algal food density, initial stocking density, temperature, salinity, water management, light intensity and photoperiod), food and feeding strategies and ammonia-N and nitrite-N toxicity for rearing shrimp  Penaeus monodon  larvae were investigated under static experimental conditions in the Coastal Zone Ecodevelopment Laboratory - UNDIP, Jepara - Indonesia.  Observations were also conducted to evaluate husbandry management practices in some shrimp hatcheries in Bandengan-Jepara, the results are used as baseline information for further experimental studies.  Initial studies of envirnmental factors revealed that an algal food density of 80 x 103 cells ( Chaetoceros  sp. ml-1), initial stocking density of 80 larvae 1-1, temperature of 30oC and salinity of 28 ppt, were optimal for rearing  P.monodon  larvae.  Water exchange (100%) on a regular basis (every alternate day) significantly improved survival and growth performance of shrimp larvae and reduced the levels of ammonia-N and nitrite-N in the rearing medium.  These variables were then fixed as standard rearing conditions for subsequent experiments.  Improving light intensities from 0.75-1.0 uEm-2s-1 to 2.25-2.50 uEm-2s-1 significantly (P <  0.01) increased survival rate of shrimp larvae but not their development rate.  It was suggested that temperature and salinity are the most important environmental factors which significantly influenced shrimp larval performance.  Studies on the effect of photoperiod (24h L:OD h and 12h L:12 h L: 12 h D) revealed that it did not significantly influence survival or growth performance.  A temperature of 34oC appeared to be the upper thermal tolerance limit for  P.monodon  larvae under the rearing conditions of the present study.  Different foods and feeding strategies for rearing shrimp larvae were investigated. Mixed algae ( Chaetoceros  sp and  Tetraselmis sp) was the best for survival and growth performance of  P.monodon  larvae.   Artemia  strain `Utah' and `San Francisco Bay') did not influence survival or growth of shrimp larvae.   Artemia  density (no. nauplii ml-1) significantly influenced both larval performance and water quality.  An  artemia  density of 3 nauplii ml-1 appeared best.  Timing of first introduction of  artemia  nauplii was found to be important.  Larvae fed  artemia  nauplii from Zoea-3 (Z3) onwards performed better.  Zoeal shrimp larvae were more susceptible to ammonia-N and nitrite-N than mysis larvae.  The 48-h LC 50s of ammonia-N for zoea and mysis ranged from 8.07 to 10.15 mgl-1 and 12.23 to 17.29 mgl-1 respectively.  48-h LC 50s of nitrite-N ranged from 3.47 to 5.63 mgl-1 and 7.82 to 9.62 mgl-1 for zoea and mysis respectively.  Acceptable levels (`safe levels') of ammonia-N and nitrite-N were estimated from lethal threshold concentrations (+  incipient LC 50) multiplied by an application factor of 0.1.  Safe levels were estimated as 38 ug. ammonia-NL-1 and 24 ug. NO2NL-1.

T1  - THE GENETICS AND ECOPHYSIOLOGY OF LASAEA SP.
AN  - 303924291
AB  - Adult Lasaea rubra were maintained in isolation until juveniles were released. The electrophoretic phenotypes of adults and progeny were identical. The electrophoretic phenotypes observed were apparently heterozygous.    272 adult Lasaea rubra, from 29 crevice populations were subjected to electrophoresis. The data at three loci are listed. Eight different genotypes, four common and four rare, were found.    The low number of genotypes, the significant linkage disequilibrium between Gpi and Pgm-2 loci, together with the passing on of apparently heterozygous electrophoretic phenotypes in unchanged form indicates that L. rubra reproduces asexually.    Eggs were observed at various stages of meiosis. The chromosome numbers of a few nuclei were countable in embryos. The number observed varied between 2n = 120 and 2n = 212. Only bivalents were observed at metaphase I. Two polar bodies were formed during maturation. Apomixy, automixy, pre-meiotic doubling and endomitosis were ruled out.    Instead, it was concluded that L. rubra was self-fertile and that populations consisted of genetically distinct inbred lines.    Crevice populations were composed of only three inbred lines at the Gpi locus. Freshly collected populations from different shore heights showed significantly different upper median lethal temperatures. Upper shore animals had higher MLTs than lower shore animals, which were unaffected by acclimation. The different MLTs were found to be characteristic of different inbred lines (A and C). Separate populations of either A or C did not exhibit different MLTs. The thermal tolerance of L. rubra, therefore, has a large genetic component.    Two populations of L. australis and one sample of L. rubra himenoa were examined electrophoretically. In all of the samples some loci were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, indicating random assortment of alleles and out-breeding. L. australis has a planktotrophic larval phase which would offset local inbreeding. L. rubra himenoa broods its young but is clearly sexual, so brooding and asexual reproduction are not correlated. Because L. rubra himenoa is a sexual species whereas L. rubra is not, the former deserves full species status (i.e. L. himenoa).

T1  - Physicological and biochemical adaptations to cold and heat stress in flesh flies (Diptera:Sarcophagidae)
AN  - 303920549
AB  - In this study on cold and heat stress in flesh flies I have (1) compared the protection generated by mild cold and heat shock; (2) examined activation of glycogen phosphorylase by cold and heat in Sarcophaga crassipalpis; (3) compared the responses of tropical and temperate flesh flies under cold and heat stress; (4) determined generation time, diapause and cold hardiness of S. bullata (Ohio strain) in natural conditions.    1. Low (O$\sp\circ$C) temperature provides protection against cold injury and high (40$\sp\circ$C) temperature elicits a protective response against heat injury in S. crassipalpis. The cold and heat protective responses were found in all developmental stages of the fly and both result in a rapid acquisition of cold or heat tolerance. Protection is quickly lost after the flies are returned to 25$\sp\circ$C. High temperature protects against cold shock injury, but the opposite is not true. Glycerol appears to be responsible for the protection generated by cold but not for the protection generated by heat.    2. Glycogen phosphorylase of S. crassipalpis was assayed in the direction of glycogen breakdown with a coupled enzyme system. Phosphorylase can be activated in diapausing pupae and nondiapausing pharate adults, as well as other stages, by both cold and heat stress (at 0$\sp\circ$C and above 30$\sp\circ$C). Activation by cold (0$\sp\circ$C) was rapid (% phosphorylase a increased 36-58% within 30 min) and may account for the observed elevation of glycerol.    3. Two flesh fly species from the tropical lowlands of Panama (Peckia abnormis and Sarcodexia sternodontis) were more susceptible to both cold and heat shock injury than temperate flies (Sarcophaga crassipalpis and S. bullata) and a fly from a tropical high altitude site in Costa Rica (Blaesoxipha plinthopyga). The temperate flies and B. plinthopyga can respond to mild cold shock (0$\sp\circ$C) by increasing cold tolerance, glycerol production and hemolymph osmolality but not the flies from the tropical lowlands. Both tropical and temperate flies respond to high temperature (40$\sp\circ$C) by generating a protective response against heat injury. The supercooling points were quite similar in all species.    4. S. bullata can complete a maximum of four generations annually, with generation times of 265 days for the overwintering generation, and 39, 30 and 31 days for the three summer generations. None and very few pupae entered diapause in the first and second generations; 37.3% and 100% of the pupae entered diapause in the third and fourth generation. Cold tolerance and glycerol levels of the field overwintering portion of the population was higher than in flies reared under lab conditions.

T1  - Bald eagle distribution, abundance, roost use and response to human activity on the northern Chesapeake Bay, Maryland
AN  - 303901292
AB  - I studied bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) distribution, abundance, roost use and response to human activity on the northern Chesapeake Bay from 1984-89. The eagle population consisted of Chesapeake breeding eagles, Chesapeake nonbreeding eagles, northern-origin eagles and southern-origin eagles; changes in overall eagle distribution and abundance reflected the net changes in these 4 groups. Northern eagles migrated into the bay in late fall and departed in early spring. Southern eagles arrived on the northern bay throughout April-August and departed from June-October. Northern Chesapeake eagle abundance peaked twice annually; in winter, driven by the presence of northern eagles, and in summer, driven by the presence of southern birds. Of 1,117 radio-tagged eagle locations, only 55 (4.9%) occurred in human-developed habitat, which composed 27.7% of 1,442 km$\sp2$ of potential eagle habitat on the northern Chesapeake Bay (P $<$ 0.001). Only 360 of 2,532 250-m shoreline segments (14.2%) were undeveloped and lacked pedestrian and boat activity during 34 surveys. Of 2,500 km of shoreline on the northern Chesapeake, 699 km (28.0%) was developed beyond eagle tolerance, whereas an additional 1,190 km (47.6%) had development within 500 m, with limited potential for eagle use. Roost trees, predominantly oaks (Quercus spp.), beeches (Fagus americana), or yellow poplars (Liriodendron tulipifera), were taller, more accessible and had larger diameters than random trees. Roosts were found in forested blocks $>$40 ha, were closer to water, were further from roads and buildings, were adjacent to nonforested corridors, and were more often publicly owned than random sites. Winter roosts were protected from prevailing winds (northwest-northeast) more often than were summer roosts. Mean winter nightly air temperature did not differ among roost, shoreline and random sites, whereas mean nightly wind speed was greater along the shoreline than at roosts or random sites. Net radiation was greatest along the shoreline, intermediate at roost sites, and least at random points. Eagles roosting at communal sites in winter expended 201 kcal/night, compared to 202 kcal/night at shoreline perches and 199 kcal/night at random points. The cost of flying from shoreline perches to inland roosts did not significantly change the differences in nightly energy expenditure among roost and shoreline sites.

T1  - Effects of vertical mixing on phytoplankton photosynthesis and phosphorus deficiency
AN  - 303901035
AB  - Several specific effects of vertical mixing on rates of algal photosynthesis and phosphorus deficiency are investigated in this thesis. Measurements made during summer stratification in Lake Erken (central Sweden) show vertical variations in light limited ($\alpha\sp{\rm B}$) and light saturated (P$\sp{\rm B}\sb{\rm max}$) photosynthesis per unit of chlorophylla. Depressed photosynthesis in the upper water column is attributed to photoinhibition, and variations in species composition caused by the vertical migration of buoyant blue-green algae. Simulations examining the importance of vertical variations in biomass specific photosynthesis suggest a relatively small effect on areal photosynthesis. Maximum variations in monthly rates of areal photosynthesis of 24-36 percent were estimated.    Internal phosphorus loading occurs in Lake Erken as a result of: (1) Transport of phosphorus across the thermocline during stratification. (2) Increases in the thermocline depth, which results in the entrainment of hypolimnetic water and exposure of larger areas of bottom sediment to the epilimnion water. (3) The migration/transport of phosphorus rich Gloeotrichia echinulata colonies from the sediments. In spite of a relative long and stable period of thermal stratification in 1988, extreme levels of phosphorus deficiency were measured for only 2 weeks following the onset of thermal stratification. Afterwards, phosphorus deficiency decreased while biomass and productivity increased. In 1987-1989 the blooming of G. echinulata coincided with declines in mixing depth to below 10 meters, which led to increases in internal phosphorus loading and an increased transport of resting phosphorus-rich G. echinulata colonies to the epilimnion. G. echinulata have low rates of biomass specific photosynthesis. Their blooming therefore, caused seasonal declines in whole water measurements of biomass specific photosynthesis.    Predictions of photosynthesis based on incubator derived measurements of biomass specific photosynthesis and in situ measurements of irradiance may be in error if spectral differences between the incubator and in situ irradiance are not considered. These errors can vary greatly with depth, and on other spatial and temporal scales depending on the optical characteristics of the water and phytoplankton assemblage. Estimation of the magnitude of such errors shows that $\alpha\sp{\rm B}$ can be underestimated by as much as 40 percent, or overestimated by as much as 120 percent at the base of the euphotic zone. Errors at the surface are, however, small, and consequently maximum errors in areal photosynthesis are on the order of $\pm$20 percent. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Tolerance of red drum Sciaenops ocellatus fingerlings to rapidly decreasing water temperatures
AN  - 303866999
AB  - A recirculating aquarium and biofiltration system with an in-line chiller was constructed which was capable of rapidly decreasing water temperature in order to assess the potential mortality to pond-reared juvenile red drum Sciaenops ocellatus from rapid declines in water temperature associated with cold front activity. Fish were held in an earthen pond and subjected to ambient temperature and photoperiod before being removed and introduced into the biassay system when pond water reached target temperatures of 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, and 10$\sp\circ$C. Ten fish assorted by four length groups were placed into each of ten aquaria containing filtered pond water at 9 $\pm$ 1$\perthous$ salinity in which temperature matched the appropriate pond temperature. The fish were acclimated for three days then subjected to a 6$\sp\circ$C decrease over 24 h and then held for 72 h. No mortalities were recorded in any trial.

T1  - A study of the suctorian Heliophrya corlissi, its cellular longevity, anhydrobiotic capabilities, and its potential as a biomonitor of water pollution
AN  - 303848297
AB  - The suctorian Heliophrya corlissi was used to study cellular longevity, anhydrobiosis (revival after dehydration, without encystment), and its suitability as a water pollution biomonitor. Individual suctorians, when fed weekly and prevented from conjugating, survived up to 52 weeks. The extended life span of H. corlissi is a valuable characteristic for chronic biomonitoring. H. corlissi and H. burbancki are the only two protists known to undergo anhydrobiosis. The ability of H. corlissi to undergo anhydrobiosis was influenced by nutrition, maturity, and duration of exposure to dehydration. H. corlissi must be at least 4-days old to survive anhydrobiosis. However, progeny from anhydrobiotic adults could survive anhydrobiosis when only 1-day old. The longest period they could survive dehydrated was 10 days. Seven-day old Heliophrya were able to withstand no more than three repeated dehydrations, while 14-day old individuals could survive five repetitions. Yet, 7-day old anhydrobiotic progeny were observed to withstand five repeated dehydrations. An electron micrographic study of the mucous coat density, epiplasm thickness, and adhesive disc development suggested their role in anhydrobiosis. A light microscopic study of revival after anhydrobiosis made it possible to describe the following stepwise sequence of events: (1) cellular uptake of water and macronuclear swelling, (2) contractile vacuole beating, (3) cytoplasmic streaming, and (4) tentacle formation. Heliophrya corlissi was tested as a potential biomonitor, at 6 sites, in tributaries of the Anacostia River watershed. Mortality rates strongly correlated with the total of six metrics of the Rapid Bioassessment Protocol (RBP), as they were determined for the macrobenthic communities. When starved H. corlissi were tested, unfed for 7 days at 4, 25, 35$\sp\circ$C, the highest mortality rate was observed at 35$\sp\circ$C, yet mortality was reduced if they were fed during the exposure. Individuals, either hydrated or anhydrobiotic, were observed to revive after being frozen for 3 days at $-$15$\sp\circ$C. This fresh water suctorian was subjected to 6 different salinities (0, 6, 10, 16, 24, 28%). The LD$\sb{50}$ was determined at 24% for 1 day and 16% for 3 days. The stalkless, suctorian H. corlissi could be a useful biomonitor because of its cellular longevity, ability to undergo anhydrobiosis, recognizable mortality, and tolerance to different salinities and temperatures.

T1  - Factors limiting recruitment of crappie (Pomoxis spp.) in a large electric-power cooling pond
AN  - 303847707
AB  - Factors that may be limiting recruitment of black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) in Baldwin Cooling Pond were identified. Baldwin Cooling Pond is a 796-hectare, fossil fuel power cooling pond, located in Randolph County, Illinois. The adult crappie population was composed of rapidly growing individuals at very low densities. Individual fecundity was very high, ranging up to 348,400 eggs/individual. In 1987, spring temperatures were within the spawning range of black crappie for only two to three weeks. No running-ripe females were collected by trap net sampling. Running-ripe females were collected in 1988, and temperatures remained in the spawning range over a six-week period. However, no larval crappie were collected in either year.    Laboratory thermal tolerance testing was conducted to determine lethal temperatures for juvenile black crappie of mean total lengths of 30.2, 45.6, and 70.9 mm. Rapid-transfer tolerance testing yielding LT50 values of 33.8, 34.9, and 31.5$\sp\circ$C for black crappie of each total length group described, respectively. Results from slow-heating tests were expressed in a predictive multiple regression model that established acclimation temperature, total length, and condition factor as significant (p $<$ 0.0001) predictors of death temperature. Temperatures in Baldwin Cooling Pond reached levels that could be stressful to juvenile crappie.    An extremely sparse population of microcrustaceans was present in Baldwin Cooling Pond. These plankton represent essential items of the diet of juvenile crappie. Stress from limited food availability was compounded by greater caloric requirements at high temperatures.    Low population density of adults, inappropriate spring spawning temperatures, potentially lethal summer temperatures, and limited food availability are believed to be factors limiting crappie recruitment. Similar factors may have resulted in almost complete elimination of white crappie from the reservoir. Also, the riprapped shores of Baldwin Cooling Pond presented poor spawning habitat. Stocking of marked crappie of various sizes indicated that fall stockings of larger fingerlings may be most effective.    The original decline of the crappie population was related to loss of large vegetated areas in the mid-1970s. This resulted in the removal of spawning habitat and an important thermal refuge. Possible future management plans include large annual stockings of large fingerlings in late fall and reestablishment of vegetation in cove areas.

T1  - Low temperature and cation transport in cardiac myocytes
AN  - 301497817
AB  - The core temperature of deep hibernating mammals is maintained a few degrees above 0oC.  The ability of the hibernator's heart to function at temperatures which are intolerably low to the hearts of other mammals is a crucial aspect of cold tolerance in hibernators.    This thesis investigates the effects of low temperature on sarcolemmal cation transport in the heart, using ventricular myocytes isolated (in the laboratory of T. Powell) from hearts of Richardson's ground squirrel (Spermophilus richardsonii), a deep hibernator, and guinea-pig (Cavia porcellus), a nonhibernator.    The properties of the isolated myocyte preparation were investigated, with attention to the implications of the presence of nonviable cells.  The distribution of tracer radioisotopes, including space markers, is discussed with respect to measuring ion fluxes.    In experiments on cell survival, ground squirrel myocytes survived both 5oC incubations and rewarming from 5oC better than the myocytes of guinea-pigs.    It was shown that a major component of K+ influx is ouabain-sensitive and attributable to the Na+/K+ pump and that a portion of influx is inhibited by K+ channel blockers.  Na+/K+ pump activity was increased by the removal of Ca2+ from the medium, which is thought to raise [Na+]i.  Lowering the temperature appeared to attenuate this effect and the Na+/K+ pump in the guinea-pig cells failed.  In normal medium, Na+/K+ pump activity persisted at 5oC in myocytes of both species.  The persistence of Na+/K+ pump activity at low temperature in the cold-sensitive species is attributed to Na+/K+ pump stimulation by raised [Na+]i which reflects failing cation homeostasis.    A qualitative model of the effects of low temperature on membrane transport and Na+, Ca2+, and K+ homeostasis is proposed.  The results are discussed in the context of cardioplegia as well as cold tolerance and cation homeostasis.  (D90455)

T1  - Experimental studies on the growth of penaeid prawns in red sea environmental conditions
AN  - 301441576
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to examine the suitability for culture of penaeid prawns in the high salinity and temperature of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast. Two species, Penaeus monodon and Penaeus vannamei, were selected for this study. Both are already successfully farmed in other countries. The postlarvae of both species were successfully shipped to Jeddah by air, Penaeus monodon from Malaysia and Penaeus vannamei from Hawaii. Both survived well under rapid acclimation to Red Sea salinity. The postlarvae and juveniles of each species were grown for 16 weeks in shaded outdo`r tanks with controlled conditions of aeration, water flow, and stocking density. Aeration and high water flow gave the best survival and growth, and Penaeus monodon was more severely affected by sub-optimal conditions. Stocking density had little effect except at low water exchange rates in the absence of aeration. Overall Penaeus vannamei grew faster than Penaeus monodon, but the ambient water temperature was higher during the Penaeus vannamei experiments. The juveniles from the previous experiment were then on-grown in a covered raceway system for a further 32 weeks. Survival was good in each case, but this time Penaeus monodon grew faster, though under higher ambient temperatures. The mean weights after 48 weeks were 27 g and 37 g for male and female Penaeus monodon,and 27 g and 30 g respectively for Penaeus vannamei. Overall Penaeus vannamei, allowing for temperature, shows better growth in Red Sea conditions, and better tolerance of adverse environments. The effect of salinities from 5% to 40% was tested on sub-adults of Penaeus vannamei. They grew better in salinities of 5, 10 and 20% than at 30 and 40% . However, the difference was minimal between the low and high salinity and growth at the Red Sea level of 40% was satisfactory. The effects of protein level in food and feeding rate were tested on the two species. Both showed the best growth at the higher protein level of 35% and the higher feeding rate of 8% body weight/day but the highest feed efficiency at the lower feeding rate of 4% body weight per day. Weight-length relationships were very similar in the two species. In each case females were relatively heavier at the larger sizes (16 cm total length). In conclusion, imported postlarvae of both Penaeus monodon and Penaeus vannamei can be acclimated to Red Sea conditions, and grown to commercial size. The growth rates in the experimental system were not as high as those achieved commercially elsewhere. Larger-scale trials are now needed.

T1  - Growth and protein turnover in fish
AN  - 301412192
AB  - The aims of this thesis were to investigate the effects of the main abiotic and biotic factors on growth and protein turnover in fish.  The first experiments were concerned with the effects of seasonal acclimatisation and temperature acclimatisation on tissue-somatic indices, nucleic acid concentrations/ratios and protein synthesis rates in cod.  It was concluded that low water temperature resulted in an increase in tissue RNA concentration and reduced RNA (translational) activities.  At the same time, protein synthesis rates were similar between cold and warm acclimated fish.  Increased tissue RNA concentration at low water temperatures therefore appeared to be a thermal compensatory mechanism on protein synthesis rates in cod.    The next experiment investigated the effects of ovine growth hormone administration on protein turnover and RNA concentration/activity in rainbow trout.  Growth hormone administration generally stimulated protein synthesis rates resulting in larger fish; little effects on rates of protein degradation were observed.  Stimulated protein synthesis rates were the result of both increased RNA/protein ratio and/or RNA activity.    The final experiment investigated the effects of long-term nutritional regime and short-term alterations in nutrition on indices of growth rate in cod, with the aim of identifying the most sensitive indicator(s) of growth rate (nutritional status).  Of all the indices examined, liver-somatic index, stomach and intestine nucleic acid concentrations/ratios and ventricle stomach and intestine cytochrome c oxidase activities were generally the best correlates of long-term growth rate as well as being sensitive to alterations in nutritional level.  Whilst these data gave credence to the use of various correlates of growth rate under constant laboratory conditions, the use of these measurements as correlates of growth rate of wild fish may be limited under seasonally fluctuating environmental conditions.

T1  - The effects of temperature, photoperiod and ration size on the growth and thermal resistance of the hybrid striped x white bass
AN  - 303823749
AB  - The optimum temperatures for growth and conversion efficiency of original cross hybrid bass juveniles (Morone saxatilis female x M. chrysops male) were measured as a function of diel oscillating and constant temperatures, spring (increasing) and autumnal (decreasing) photoperiods, and ration sizes ranging from no food to daily satiation. The optimum temperatures for growth and peak conversion efficiency were estimated to be 26.8$\sp\circ$ and 21.2$\sp\circ$C, respectively, for fish under constant temperatures, a 12L:12D photoperiod, and fed a maximum ration size.    Springtime photoperiod (increasing 4.0 minutes per day) significantly increased growth, and autumnal photoperiod (decreasing 4.0 minutes per day) significantly reduced growth. There was a significant temperature/photoperiod interaction: maximum growth occurred at 27.9$\sp\circ$C under the springtime photoperiod, and at 25.7$\sp\circ$C under the autumnal photoperiod. Diel oscillations of 4, 6, and 8$\sp\circ$C amplitude did not influence growth rate or conversion efficiency. At lower ration sizes there was a significant shift to a cooler optimum temperature for growth. Total lipid deposition by the hybrid bass was not significantly influenced by temperature or photoperiod.    These data suggest that the hybrid bass be classified as a temperate eurytherm. Comparison of the present study with that of Cox and Coutant (1981) suggests that the hybrid may be successfully introduced where the striped bass, a temperate mesotherm, is thermally restricted.    The upper lethal limits in terms of Critical Thermal Maxima (CTM) were determined for the hybrid bass, using the studies on growth as acclimation periods to food deprivation and satiation feeding regimens and environmental factors of temperature and photoperiod. Higher acclimation temperatures resulted in significantly higher CTMs. Diel osciallating temperatures had a variable effect on CTM values. Springtime (increasing) versus autumnal (decreasing) photoperiodicity had no significant effect on the CTM. Hybrid bass deprived of food had a significantly lower CTM than bass fed to satiation.

T1  - Hypothermia and the cold exposure syndrome during prolonged exercise in a wet cold environment
AN  - 303813059
AB  - This study was designed to investigate hypothermia in humans, caused by prolonged exposure to rain, wind, and cold. The primary objective was to induce hypothermia (T$\sb{\rm CORE} \leq$ 35$\sp\circ$C) in subjects exercising in these conditions, and to determine if hypothermia was a consequence of exhaustion. Secondarily, measures of motor and psychological performance were included, in order to study the relationship between prolonged wet, cold exposure and changes in behaviour. Lightly-clothed male subjects walked along a simulated hiking trail (Wet Walk) at a constant pace, exposed to continuous "rain" and "wind" for up to 4 hours at air temperatures near 5$\sp\circ$C. Thermal and metabolic responses were monitored continuously during a trial exposure, as well as respiratory rate and heart rate. Tests of motor and behavioural performance were completed at specific intervals. Some subjects completed wet and dry (control) walks. Results show that wet, cold exposure is characterized by two stages.    1. An initial, prolonged phase, referred to as the wet-cold exposure syndrome, was characterized by intense shivering (30-50% increase in oxygen consumption) and behavioural responses associated with the effects of peripheral cooling (8$\sp\circ$C decrease in mean skin temperature). Subjects often exhibited signs and symptoms of "hypothermia" within 2 hours of wet, cold exposure, but rectal temperature was typically maintained above 36$\sp\circ$C. Impaired motor function (grip strength $<$70% normal; manual dexterity $<$50% normal) and behavioural distress (20-40% reduction in cognitive test performance; significant reduction in vigilance performance) occurred without the development of hypothermia.    2. Rapid descent towards clinical hypothermia was associated with decreased heat production due to exhaustion. In one case, a sudden decline in rectal temperature began after 3 hours of wet, cold exposure, concomitant with decreased oxygen consumption despite a constant walking pace: rectal temperature dropped 1.4$\sp\circ$C to 35.3$\sp\circ$C in less than 30 minutes. Signs of exhaustion (staggering, faintness, nausea) were evident. Observations also suggest that cold tolerance--the ability to maintain prolonged activity in wet-cold--is related to aerobic fitness and somatotype. For example, a low-fitness, ectomorphic subject, whose relative heat production decreased as his walking pace slowed, developed hypothermia (rectal temperature 35.2$\sp\circ$C) while walking.    The overall conclusion from this study is that prolonged wet, cold exposure of humans produces significant cold stress as evidenced by thermoregulatory, psychological and motor responses, but does not produce a significant hypothermia in the absence of exhaustion.

T1  - Development of trace analytical methods for aldicarb and other carbamate pesticides in water
AN  - 303791396
AB  - Analytical methods for the trace determination of aldicarb, aldicarb sulfoxide and aldicarb sulfone have been developed. Since aldicarb can be chromatographed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and detected with a 254 nm detector, the first method developed is based on HPLC following preconcentration with a Waters C$\sb{18}$ SEP-PAK$\sp{\rm (R)}$ and evaporation of the eluting solvent. The procedure uses a reverse phase column with methanol-water containing acetic acid or acetate buffer as the mobile phase. Preconcentration factors of 1:100 are achieved from 200 ml samples extracted on SEP-PAK's$\sp{\rm (R)}$ and eluted with 2 ml of methanol. An additional 1:10 preconcentration factor is achieved by evaporation of the 2 ml extract to 0.2 ml in a micro Kuderna-Danish evaporator. With initial detection at the low ppm levels by direct injection HPLC, the two-step preconcentration procedure provides detection at the low ppb range. Demonstrated detection limits are well below the 7 ppb "safe" levels in drinking water specified by the New York State Department of Health.    The second approach is a new gas chromatographic method for the quantitation of aldicarb and its oxidative metabolites. It has also been modified for the quantitation of carbofuran, oxamyl, and methomyl. This method is based on capillary gas chromatography with a nitrogen phosphorous detector. Aldicarb, aldicarb sulfoxide and aldicarb sulfone are quantified as aldicarb nitrile, aldicarb sulfoxide nitrile and aldicarb sulfone nitrile, respectively. These are the major thermal degradation products obtained with an injection port temperature of 200$\sp\circ$C. It has been used to quantify nanogram levels of aldicarb, aldicarb sulfoxide and aldicarb sulfone in a single injection procedure.    The first method is particularly useful for degradative studies of aldicarb in the laboratory while the second is useful for both environmental sampling and for degradative studies in soil/water systems in the laboratory. These methods were previously documented in the following publications. Spalik, J., Janauer, G. E., Lau, M., and Lemley, A. T., J. Chromatog. 253 (1982) 289-294 and Zhong, W. Z., Lemley, A. T., and Spalik, J., J. Chromatog., 299 (1984) 269-274.    In addition to the two methods developed, supporting work was done to determine the UV absorption and thermal properties of aldicarb, aldicarb sulfoxide, and aldicarb sulfone. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy was also utilized to obtain the mass spectra and identities of the thermal degradation products of aldicarb, aldicarb sulfoxide, aldicarb sulfone, methomyl, oxamyl, and carbofuran.

T1  - Evaluation of partial vitrification of the freeze tolerant gall fly larva, Eurosta solidaginis: A model for and mechanistic evaluation of human red blood cell cryopreservation
AN  - 303788841
AB  - Recent developments have opened the possibility that the problems of freezing and thawing organs might be overcome by limiting the amount of ice formed by the process of vitrification. Presented are two objectives: first, the establishment of proof of partial vitrification occuring in the gall fly larva, and second, the application and evaluation of multicomponent polyol solutions towards the successful storage (via vitrification) of human red blood cells (RBC). The establishment of natural system that utilizes a partial vitrification strategy during overwintering was demonstrated by analysis of synthetic gall fly hemolymph. Application of nuclear magnetic resonance and differential scanning calorimetric techniques demonstrate that Eurosta solidaginis survive exposure to low temperatures in a partial vitrified state. The multi-component cryoprotectant system produced by the fly was evaluated for its cryoprotective ability on the storage of human RBC's. Thermal analysis of RBC's that were treated with insect-modelled cryoprotectant solutions, "commercial" and polymeric cryoprotectants demonstrated intracellular and extracellular vitrification.

T1  - A classification of streams in Massachusetts: "To be used as a fisheries management tool"
AN  - 303774483
AB  - The composition and distribution of freshwater fish in 691 Massachusetts streams (1,430 samples statewide) surveyed during 1969-1987 were documented. White sucker (Catostomus commersoni) was the most ubiquitous species, while blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were the most abundantly represented. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) appear well-distributed in contrast to historical records.    A classification system for wadeable-sized streams in Massachusetts was developed using exploratory, multivariate statistics to identify repeated patterns of stream structure and function, based on the relationship between measured habitat variables and stream fish species assemblages, with particular emphasis on reproducing trout populations.    The ordination technique of detrended correspondence analysis provided a portrayal of stream fish species relative to their distributional pattern along environmental gradients statewide. This analysis, in correspondence with established physiographic regions and documented limits of fish species distribution, facilitated the delineation of three fish faunal regions in Massachusetts, encompassing the Berkshire-Valley, Central-Upland, and Coastal-Lowland areas of the state.    Cluster analysis of stream gradient and summer water temperature measures, followed by discriminant analysis, led to the development of a six-class thermal-gradient model which effectively classified 79 percent of a test-data set, on the basis of discrimination between optimal (reproducing) trout and non-trout streams. Stratified by fish faunal region, analysis of fish-group structure within predicted stream habitat classes were investigated, relative to determinants of stream habitat degradation.    Fish species assemblages in Massachusetts' smaller, wadeable streams differ along an environmental gradient from the western Berkshire highlands to the eastern Coastal seaboard. Within the limits of fish species biogeography, a similar gradient is operative within any given drainage system as well. However, this gradient is not necessarily continuous, but varies primarily in response to abiotic factors of the environment, which then serve to regulate fish species occurrence.    This system for classifying streams along an environmental continuum of chemico-physical conditions, serves as an initial macrohabitat "templet" upon which to base further evaluation of environmental impacts on stream ecosystem structure and function. It will also be used to manage the Commonwealth's lotic environments by ecological resource category, leading to implementation of a statewide wild trout management program.

T1  - LOW-TEMPERATURE AND CATION TRANSPORT IN CARDIAC MYOCYTES (HIBERNATION)
AN  - 303746150
AB  - The core temperature of deep hibernating mammals is maintained a few degrees above 0$\sp\circ$C. The ability of the hibernator's heart to function at temperatures which are intolerably low to the hearts of other mammals is a crucial aspect of cold tolerance in hibernators.    This thesis investigates the effects of low temperature on sarcolemmal cation transport in the heart, using ventricular myocytes isolated (in the laboratory of T. Powell) from hearts of Richardson's ground squirrel (Spermophilus richardsonii), a deep hibernator, and guinea-pig (Cavia porcellus), a nonhibernator.    The properties of the isolated myocytes preparation were investigated, with attention to the implications of the presence of nonviable cells. The distribution of tracer radioisotopes, including space markers, is discussed with respect to measuring ion fluxes.    In experiments on cell survival, ground squirrel myocytes survived both 5$\sp\circ$C incubations and rewarming from 5$\sp\circ$C better than the myocytes of guinea-pigs.    It was shown that a major component of K$\sp+$ influx is ouabain-sensitive and attributable to the Na$\sp+$/K$\sp+$ pump and that a portion of influx is inhibited by K$\sp+$ channel blockers. Na$\sp+$/K$\sp+$ pump activity was increased by the removal of Ca$\sp{2+}$ from the medium, which is thought to raise (Na$\sp+$) $\sb{\rm i}$. Lowering the temperature appeared to attenuate this effect and the Na$\sp+$/K$\sp+$ pump in the guinea-pig cells failed. In normal medium, Na$\sp+$/K$\sp+$ pump activity persisted at 5$\sp\circ$C in myocytes of both species. The persistence of Na$\sp+$/K$\sp+$ pump activity at low temperature in the cold-sensitive species is attributed to Na$\sp+$/K$\sp+$ pump stimulation by raised (Na$\sp+$) $\sb{\rm i}$ which reflects failing cation homeostasis.    A qualitative model of the effects of low temperature on membrane transport and Na$\sp+$, Ca$\sp{2+}$, and K$\sp+$ homeostasis is proposed. The results are discussed in the context of cardioplegia as well as cold tolerance and cation homeostasis.

T1  - Recycled thermal swing adsorption: Multicomponent separations of aromatic hydrocarbons from paraffins
AN  - 303734218
AB  - The recycled thermal swing adsorption (RTSA) process may have possible application in the separation of dilute aromatics from white oil or gasoline. Due to health, environmental or other technical reasons, aromatic compounds must be removed from these largely aliphatic mixtures. Recycled thermal swing adsorption offers an alternative in the situation where distillation may be impractical.    RTSA is an offshoot of the much maligned parametric pumping and cycling zone adsorption processes. The flagrant shortcomings of those processes were: the former could achieve high separation factors only when operated in the batch mode, and the latter never achieved high separation factors. The present RTSA process appears to overcome those problems.    Temperature swing adsorption (TSA) is different in several respects from conventional adsorption. This dissertation explores the distinctions from the standpoint of adsorbent characteristics, which include thermal exchange capacity, and properties that affect dissipative effects, e.g., intraparticle diffusivity, bed permeability, axial dispersion coefficient, and thermal diffusivity. Many of the dissipative effects can be manipulated by adjusting particle size, though trade-offs exist that have no clear cut technical resolution. The adsorbents considered were: silica gel, activated alumina, activated carbon, zeolite 13X, and a polymeric adsorbent (XAD-7). Silica gel was selected due to its superior thermal exchange capacity.    General theoretical results for single and multiple solute column studies are detailed, along with experimental column results for the separation of aromatic solutes from aliphatic solvents, i.e., toluene and xylene from heptane simulating cleanup of white oil (a refinery product used in pharmaceuticals, etc.). The purified product concentration is typically on the order of 1/100 to 1/1000 that of the feed, while that of the enriched product is usually 2$\times$ to 6$\times$ that of the feed. The fractional amount of product recycle is roughly 0.8, depending on the concentration and desired product purity.    In any event, recycled thermal swing adsorption may be applicable in other areas (e.g., biochemical purification, wastewater treatment and azeotrope breaking), as its development is only limited by engineering skills and the ability to recognize potential applications.

T1  - Genetic and environmental components of thermal tolerance in the least killifish, Heterandria formosa
AN  - 303706665
AB  - Populations of the least killifish, Heterandria formosa are found in a wide variety of habitats, including habitats that differ widely in average temperature and in range of seasonal temperatures. To determine whether this ability to exist in thermally different sites is owing to phenotypic plasticity or to population differentiation I raised fish from a spring site and a pond site under common laboratory conditions. Fish were raised at one of two temperatures during gestation and at one of two temperatures from birth to sexual maturity. Gestation temperature, rearing temperature, population of origin, and gender had complex, interacting effects on critical thermal maximum and minimum at sexual maturity, on offspring survival, and on time to maturity. In particular, the populations were strongly differentiated for offspring survival and time to maturity, although the magnitude of the differences depended on the environment. Females performed better than males when genders differed.    H. formosa also exhibit superfetation, the presence of embryos in different developmental stages in the ovary at one time. There have been few comparative studies of interspecific variation in superfetation, and there have been no surveys of population variation in reproductive traits within a superfetating species. In this study I followed seasonal changes in reproductive parameters of four populations of H. formosa for all or part of 4 years.    The four populations differed in breeding phenology, level of superfetation, total volume of embryos carried, and brood size. This variation does not correspond to either general habitat similarities among the populations (ponds versus rivers), or to habitat stability. I also discovered that first, females must hold back some same-stage embryos while advancing others and second, that size of females, as measured by standard length, clearly influences the total number of embryos, brood size, and number of embryos carried in each stage. Yet despite this relationship between body size and embryo capacity, brood size is not constrained by space available for late-stage embryos.

T1  - The response of the development and reproduction of the Pecos pupfish (Cyprinodon pecosensis) to natural differences among habitats at Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico
AN  - 303701102
AB  - At Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge (BLNWR) in 1977 through 1983 Cyprinodon pecosensis, the Pecos pupfish, occurred primarily in three types of habitat: springs, management units, and sinkhole lakes. The sinkhole lakes contained the largest pupfish populations. The extremely variable water temperatures, dissolved oxygen concentrations, pH values, alkalinities, water colors, and patterns of chemical stratification and monomixis in each sinkhole lake were largely a function of salinity and sinkhole morphometry, which in turn were related to lake age.    Of the thirteen fish species at BLNWR, the five cyprinodonts were the most common and widespread. The distribution of each cyprinodont was unique, and the abundances of each were all negatively correlated. The distribution and abundance of the cyprinodonts was partly a function of differential tolerances for physical factors. Predation and competition among the cyprinodonts appeared to be less important.    Growth rate in C. pecosensis decreased with salinity while rates of development increased with temperature. Consequently, the smallest pupfish were found at high temperatures in all salinities, while the largest were found in sites of low temperature and low salinity.    Warm winter conditions promoted early, intense reproduction in the spring. During the reproductive season, spawning occurred each day whenever temperatures were near 28$\sp\circ$C. At all times of year, some males were territorial in each population whenever temperatures were above 19.5$\sp\circ$C.    When reproductively active, male C. pecosensis at BLNWR almost always exhibited territoriality. Consort pairing and satellite males were important in one site with a sparse population of small pupfish. Spawning rates per male were greatest for intermediate-sized males on intermediate-sized territories 2 to 3 meters from shore over Chara and Ruppia. Of territorial male behaviors, only fighting with and displaying to other males related significantly to reproductive success.    Female pupfish produced on average 4.3 eggs per day, with higher rates associated with larger body sizes. Early maturation, seasonally early reproduction, and temporally concentrated reproduction were positively associated. Also, within the constraint of body size variation, egg size and number were inversely related. These patterns were regulated primarily by temperature and salinity. Pupfish life histories did not relate to mortality schedules or population density regimes.

T1  - OSMOREGULATION IN THE PRAWN PALAEMON LONGIROSTRIS (CARIDEA, PALAEMONIDAE)
AN  - 303747234
AB  - Salinity tolerance, and several aspects of osmoregulation, ionic regulation and permeability were measured for Palaemon longirostris at three temperatures (4, 12 & 20$\sp\circ$C). Influence of ontogenetic stage on salinity tolerance and osmoregulation was investigated by testing separately individuals sorted, using carapace length, into 'small' (10-18mm), 'medium' (18-24mm), 'large' ($>$24mm) and 'ovigerous' ($>$24mm) size groupings. Effect of seasonal acclimatization on salinity tolerance and osmoregulation was taken into account by comparing responses of summer- with winter-collected prawns.    Irrespective of temperature and size, summer Palaemon longirostris were extremely euryhaline and had $>$90% survival in various salinities from 0.5-34$\perthous$. For summer prawns, survival in 43$\perthous$ was reduced, particularly at 4$\sp\circ$C. Salinity tolerance of winter prawns was generally less than that of summer individuals, this difference being marked at salinity extremes in combination with low temperatures.    Over the salinity range 0.5-34$\perthous$, prawns were very efficient hyper-hypo-osmoregulators at each temperature. At 43$\perthous$, blood osmolalities tended towards the isosmotic, indicating that osmoregulation was breaking down. There was no clear effect of prawn size or season on osmoregulation, however, low temperature appeared to be disruptive. Transfer of prawns from 14$\perthous$ to either 5$\perthous$ or 34$\perthous$, and from 1$\perthous$ to 34$\perthous$, resulting in a new steady blood osmolality within 6-12h. Transfer from 34$\perthous$ to 1$\perthous$, caused blood osmolality to drop significantly within 12h, and a new equilibrium was not reached until 72h. The inorganic ions sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium and magnesium accounted for $>$94% of the total blood osmolality over the salinity range 0.5-34$\perthous$. There was no consistent effect of temperature on the regulation of these ions.    Prawns showed reduced permeability (to water) at low salinity and low temperature. Transfer of prawns from 34$\perthous$ to 1$\perthous$ had no immediate effect on permeability, however, transfer of prawns from 1$\perthous$ to 34$\perthous$ caused an immediate increase in permeability. The permeability of Palaemon longirostris, acclimated to a range of salinities between 0.5-34$\perthous$, was lower than that of Palaemonetes varians, Crangon crangon and Palaemon elegans.    These results are discussed in terms of their adaptive significance and in relation to the evolution of the family Palaemonidae. It is suggested that Palaemon longirostris represents a evolutionary link between brackish-water and freshwater palaemonids.

T1  - Eco-physiological adaptations to overwintering in the eastern garter snake, Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis
AN  - 303706853
AB  - Field (1981-1988) and laboratory (1985-1988) studies of eastern garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis) were conducted concerning selected aspects of physiological and ecological adaptations to overwintering.    An abandoned farm well in central Wisconsin was used as a traditional communal hibernaculum by 200-300 garter snakes. Field and laboratory evidence suggested that snakes located the den with the aid of pheromone trails deposited by conspecifics. An artificial den, modeled after the Wisconsin hibernaculum, was constructed in southwestern Ohio and stocked with Wisconsin transplants. Behavioral responses of snakes entering and emerging from hibernation coincided with seasonal cycling of the depth-temperature gradient within the dens. Both dens became partially or completely filled with rain water; garter snakes remained in submerged microsites throughout much of the winter. Laboratory observations showed that, if the water around them froze, snakes could tolerate ice-entombment for at least short periods.    Winter submergence resulted in a significant decrease in rates of oxygen consumption and cardiac activity. The energy expenditure of submerged snakes during winter was reduced by more than 50% relative to that of snakes remaining in air at the same temperature. Transcutaneous diffusion of oxygen was apparently sufficient, since submerged snakes metabolized aerobically. Unlike snakes hibernating in air, submerged snakes remained hydrated and, therefore, did not succumb to dissication.    Snakes using the Wisconsin den hibernated longer and were exposed to lower environmental temperatures relative to snakes using the Ohio den. Snakes in the Ohio den had a higher average daily energetic cost during hibernation as well as a greater total winter energy expenditure.    Remarkably, garter snakes collected in Wisconsin and Ohio demonstrated limited locomotory abilities at body temperatures as low as $-4$ C; cold tolerance was little influenced by season or thermal acclimation to 5 or 15 C. A difference in cold tolerance existed among populations separated latitudinally by only 850 km. Supercooling points were high, variable, independent of acclimation and acclimatization, and non-repeatable; thus, supercooling was judged not to be an effective mechanism for freeze avoidance. Without the aid of cryoprotectants, Wisconsin snakes survived freezing in the laboratory of at least 36% of their body water and remained frozen for 48 h without ill effects.

T1  - Behavioral and physiological adaptations to cold in a freeze tolerant High Arctic insect, Gynaephora groenlandica (Wocke) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae)
AN  - 303706495
AB  - G. groenlandica has a unique life history (14-year life-cycle, mid-summer dormancy and perennial freeze tolerance), owing to its behavioral and physiological adaptations to survival at the physiological limits to life in the High Arctic. Consequently, responses to temperature change were compared in summer- and winter-adapted larvae, specifically: (1) Behavioral thermoregulation and feeding energy budget; (2) Cryoprotectant metabolism and tissue responses to cold. A novel technique of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to examine larval metabolism in vivo and this was correlated with temperature-induced tissue changes. Summer larvae thermoregulate by basking which raises their body temperature by up to 25$\sp\circ$C above the ambient temperature (T$\sb{\rm a}$ = $-2$ to 5$\sp\circ$C). Larval growth rate is doubled (0.016 mg dry wt./ mg of larva/ day) at 15 and 30$\sp\circ$C incubation temperatures compared to 5$\sp\circ$C (0.008 mg dry wt./ mg of larva/ day). Larval assimilation efficiency is maximal at T$\sb{\rm b}$ $\sp\sim 15\sp\circ$C, but decreases at basking T$\sb{\rm b}$ of $\sp\sim 30\sp\circ$C, presumably as maintenance metabolism increases. Metabolic rate is highest in feeding larvae and lowest in cold-acclimated and inactive larvae. The larvae undergo "voluntary hypothermia" in order to avoid an energy deficit resulting from high maintenance metabolism during mid-season when the energy content and food quality of Salix arctica declines. Since behaviors other than basking cause larval T$\sb{\rm b}$ to drop, basking plays a central role in the diel and sequential organization of larval behavior. Basking under optimal conditions leads to maximal rates of oxygen consumption at T$\sb{\rm b}$ $>$ 30$\sp\circ$C, whereas below 5$\sp\circ$C, oxidative metabolism is depressed. Long-term reduction in oxygen consumption is caused by greatly decreased mitochondrial numbers observed in cold-acclimated larvae. The cytochrome c concentration remains independent of acclimation temperature despite the mitochondrial breakdown and reduced oxidative phosphorylation. Coincident with the reduced oxidative metabolism below 5$\sp\circ$C is glycerol accumulation. Temperature figures prominently in the control of larval activity and freeze tolerance. Winter larvae are "thermoconformers"; the low ambient temperatures induce mitochondrial degradation allowing glycerol to accumulate. The summer larvae are "thermoregulators", able to behaviorally alter their glycerol metabolism and relative freeze tolerance.

T1  - Aerobic metabolism of deer mice at low and high altitude
AN  - 303694179
AB  - I studied thermal, seasonal, and altitudinal effects on the aerobic metabolism of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Seasonal and altitudinal effects on VO$\sb2$max, field metabolic rate (FMR), aerobic reserve (VO$\sb2$max - FMR), and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were studied on wild and recently captured mice at low and high altitude. The effect of cold acclimation on VO$\sb2$max was studied in the laboratory at low altitude.    Cold acclimation increased VO$\sb2$max measured by either cold exposure or treadmill exercise, but the increase in cold exposure VO$\sb2$max (31%) was greater than the increase in treadmill exercise VO$\sb2$max (9%). After cold acclimation, cold exposure elicited higher VO$\sb2$max than did treadmill exercise. The increase in treadmill exercise VO$\sb2$max may reflect the dual role of skeletal muscle in exercise and thermogenesis.    Measurements made at the same time of year indicated that high altitude mice had similar VO$\sb2$max, higher FMR, and hence lower aerobic reserve than low altitude mice. These comparisons demonstrate altitudinal effects, but do not isolate the thermal component of altitude from other altitudinal factors. Comparisons of mice from similar thermal environments, but different altitudes (high altitude, June versus low altitude, February) indicated that high altitude mice have similar VO$\sb2$max, FMR, and aerobic reserve, but higher BMR than low altitude mice. This suggests that for wild mice, most differences in aerobic metabolism between low and high altitude are attributable to thermal differences. Despite theoretical predictions and limited empirical evidence that VO$\sb2$max should decline with the decrease in pO$\sb2$ at high altitude, the VO$\sb2$max of high altitude mice was similar to that of low altitude mice.    Deer mice at low altitude showed significant seasonal variation in VO$\sb2$max, FMR, and aerobic reserve, but not BMR. BMR and VO$\sb2$max were significantly positively correlated. Thus, deer mice may not maintain high VO$\sb2$max at all times, because high VO$\sb2$max is associated with high BMR and probably increased daily energy requirements.

T1  - Osmoregulatory function in summer and winter acclimatized painted turtles, Chrysemys picta
AN  - 303672871
AB  - The painted turtle, Chrysemys picta, is an air breathing ectotherm that hibernates submerged in fresh water. It faces a hypoosmotic environment and the persistent problem of influx of water and efflux of electrolytes across epithelial surfaces. Aquatically hibernating turtles in a dormant hypometabolic state face these osmotic challenges at a time when the capacity for energy utilization is very low. The purpose of this research is to examine the osmoregulatory function of summer- and winter-acclimatized painted turtles.    Painted turtles in southeast Michigan hibernated at sites that never froze but became anoxic for extended periods during the winter. Arousal from hibernation in spring was most closely correlated with reversal of the vertical thermal gradient.    Exposure to cold led to an increase in body mass in fasted turtles. Total body water (TBW) expressed as the percent of body mass was greater in winter- than summer-acclimatized turtles and increased with decreasing temperature. Thus it appeared an accumulation of environmental water was responsible for the increase in body mass. 83% of the increase in TBW was accounted for by expansion of the extracellular fluid space. Winter acclimatization resulted in a decrease in plasma sodium concentration. Winter animals showed a decrease in water influx compared with summer animals, but could not be explained by a change in skin permeability.    Urine flow (V) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increased with temperature. Neither GFR nor V underwent seasonal acclimatization. The inulin U/P ratio also increased with temperature but showed no seasonal acclimatization. Thus, temperature affected both glomerular and tubular function. Experimental hydration elicited a marked increase in GFR and V. In hydrated turtles, V and GFR increased with temperature, but did not undergo acclimatization. Inulin U/P did not change with hydration indicating that hydration affects glomerular rather than tubular function.    Winter acclimatization and temperature had profound effects on osmoregulatory function of painted turtles. However, winter animals limited water accumulation and body fluid dilution by (1) reducing the rate of water influx, (2) maintaining urine flow, and (3) increasing GFR and urine flow when water is accumulated. These adjustments may permit long-term submergence at low temperature during hibernation.

T1  - Rate of heat acclimation: Effects of exercise intensity and duration
AN  - 303658560
AB  - Low-intensity exercise (40-50% VO$\sb{\rm 2max}$) for 60-90 min over 7-8 days in the heat is commonly utilized to achieve acclimation. This study was designed to investigate if shorter, intense exercise would produce a similar degree of acclimation. Nine trained runners performed two seven-day exercise-heat stress regimes, consisting of running for 60 min at 50% VO$\sb{\rm 2max}$ (T$\sb{50}$) or 30-35 min at 75% VO$\sb{\rm 2max}$ (T75) in dry heat (40$\sp\circ$C, 27% rh). The criterion for acclimation was heart rate and rectal temperature (Tr) responses during 90 min heat tolerance tests before (HTT$\sb1$) and after (HTT$\sb2$) each acclimation period.    The post-acclimation HTTs indicated a similar degree of acclimation with both protocols. Final HTT$\sb2$ heart rates and rectal temperatures were reduced equally (P $<$ 0.005) as compared to HTT$\sb1$ for T$\sb{50}$ and T$\sb{75}$. Additionally, resting pre-exercise T$\sb{\rm r}$, and total caloric expenditures were significantly decreased (P $<$ 0.005), while sweating responsiveness significantly increased (P $\leq$ 0.05) with acclimation.    These data indicate that similar levels of heat acclimation were achieved with the two training protocols. both protocols were equally effective in reducing exercising metabolism, reducing T$\sb{\rm r}$ at rest, and increasing sweating responsiveness, all three of which are known to contribute to heat acclimation.

T1  - Physiological ecology of northern populations of C(4) grasses
AN  - 303630118
AB  - Six C$\sb4$ grasses (Districhlis stricta, Muhlenbergia glomerata var. cinnoides, M. mexicana, M. richardsonis, Spartina gracilis, S. pectinata), occur in the boreal forest of northwestern Canada. Carbon isotope ratios and Kranz anatomy were used to confirm that these populations use the C$\sb4$ photosynthetic pathway. The boreal climate does not support C$\sb4$ species except where the mean minimum temperature for July is at least 7.5$\sp\circ$C. C$\sb4$ grasses were found in open microsites warmed geothermally or by high irradiance. Many of the sites were saline. Structural characteristics suggest that all three C$\sb4$ subtypes (PCK, NADP-ME and NAD-ME) are found in cool environments.    Photosynthetic properties of a northern population of S. gracilis were compared with a co-occurring C$\sb3$ grass, Agropyron trachycaulum, and with a southern population of S. gracilis. The optimum temperature for photosynthesis in the northern population was 25$\sp\circ$C, 6$\sp\circ$C lower than the southern population and 7$\sp\circ$C higher than the C$\sb3$ grass. The northern population of S. gracilis was less inhibited by chilling in the light than either the southern population or the C$\sb3$ grass. Apparent quantum yields in the two populations of S. gracilis were similar at 25$\sp\circ$C, but at 15$\sp\circ$C that of the northern population was higher. AT 5$\sp\circ$C apparent quantum yield in the northern population declined sharply.    Phenological studies showed that spring regrowth began earlier in C$\sb3$ grasses (A. trachycaulum, Puccinellia nuttalliana) than in C$\sb4$ grasses (S. gracilis, D. stricta). C$\sb3$ species maximized leafiness during spring and autumn. C$\sb4$ species maximized leafiness in midsummer. Species from the strongly saline zone (P. nuttalliana, D. stricta) began flowering earlier than species from the moderately saline zone (A. trachycaulum, S. gracilis). Within both zones, flowering of C$\sb3$ and C$\sb4$ species was simultaneous.    Spartina gracilis and D. stricta and two C$\sb4$ grasses from the Northern Great Plains, Andropogon scoparius and Bouteloua gracilis were evaluated for tolerance to freezing. All populations survived $-25\sp\circ$C or lower. Rhizomes aided the regeneration of frost damaged crowns. Cold acclimation of northern populations of these species occurred earlier than southern populations. Both populations eventually reached the same level of freezing tolerance.

T1  - The hydrography and ecology of the Liverpool docks
AN  - 301511675
AB  - Many dockland areas are being developed for industrial, commercial and residential use. Such developments are enhanced by the proximity of large expanses of water, in the form of dock basins. Historically, the water quality of these areas has been poor due for variety of reasons. With management, the water quality can be improved, so increasing the diversity of the flora and fauna, and creating the pleasant environment required by such redevelopments. The present investigation attempts to evaluate the hydrographical and biological fluctuations of two rehabilitated dockbasins at Liverpool, isolated from the polluted Mersey estuary. Monitoring was carried out on a regular basis utilising six sites to furnish physico-chemical (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon) and biological (zooplankton) data. Surveys also examined the dockwall and sediment benthos, and the fish populations. The study found that whilst, for the most part, the shallow Queen's Dock is well-mixed, the deeper Graving Dock is frequently stratified. Stratification is associated with a number of poor water quality conditions such as algal blooms, hypolimnetic deoxygenation, and malodour. The Graving Dock was artificially mixed preventing stratification thereby reducing the propensity for such problems to occur. There were at times during the study, high densities of both phytoplankton and zooplankton, although the diversity of the latter was relatively low. Correlations of the fluctuation of the plankton with other parameters are discussed. The benthos also lacked diversity, and the reasons for this are discussed in terms of the age of the redeveloped dock system and physiological tolerances of the biota. Fish densities appear to be low but this warrants further investigation. Future management strategies for the dock system are discussed and evaluated in terms of the various activities occurring at the site and the possible conflict of interests.

T1  - Osmoregulation of the prawn Palaemon longirostris (Caridea, Palaemonidae)
AN  - 301491270
AB  - Salinity tolerance, and several aspects of osmoregulation, ionic regulation and permeability were measured for Palaemon longirostris at three temperatures (4, 12 & 20oC). Influence of ontogenetic stage on salinity tolerance and osmoregulation was investigated by testing separately individuals sorted, using carapace length, into `small' (10-18mm), `medium' (18-24mm), `large' (> 24mm) and `ovigerous' (> 24mm) size groupings. Effect of seasonal acclimatization on salinity tolerance and osmoregulation was taken into account by comparing responses of summer- with winter-collected prawns. Irrespective of temperature and size, summer Palaemon longirostris were extremely euryhaline and had > 90% survival in various salinities from 0.5-34% o. For summer prawns, survival in 43% o was reduced, particularly at 4oC. Salinity tolerance of winter prawns was generally less than that of summer individuals, this difference being marked at salinity extremes in combination with low temperature. Over the salinity range 0.5-34% o, prawns were very efficient hyper-hypo-osmoregulators at each temperature. At 43% o, blood osmolalities tended towards the isosmotic, indicating that osmoregulation was breaking down. There was no clear effect of prawn size or season on osmoregulation, however, low temperature appeared to be disruptive. Transfer of prawns from 14% o to either 5% o or 34% o, and from 1% o to 34% o, resulted in a new steady blood osmolality within 6-12h. Transfer from 34% o to 1% o caused blood osmolality to drop significantly within 12h, and a new equilibrium was not reached until 72 h. The inorganic ions sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium and magnesium accounted for > 94% of total blood osmolality over the salinity range 0.5% o. There was no consistent effect of temperature on the regulation of these ions. Prawns showed reduced permeability (to water) at low salinity and low temperature. Transfer of prawns from 34% o to 1% o had no immediate effect on permeability, however, transfer of prawns from 1% o to 34% o caused an immediate increase in permeability. The permeability of Palaemon longirostris, acclimated to a range of salinities between 0.5-34% o, was lower than that of Palaemonetes varians, Crangon crangon and Palaemon elegans. These results are discussed in terms of their adaptive significance and in relation to the evolution of the family Palaemonidae. It is suggested that Palaemon longirostris represents an evolutionary link between brackish-water and freshwater palaemonids.

T1  - Food consumption, growth and recruitment in perch (Perca fluviatilis L.)
AN  - 303527478
AB  - Food consumption, growth and survival in young-of-the-year perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) and their effects on recruitment were studied in Baltic coastal waters, including areas affected by thermal discharges.    Independent of temperature, the metabolic rate and, hence, the growth potential, was found to be considerably lower in winter than in summer. As perch is a visual feeder, this effect is probably an adaptation to short days limiting consumption in combination with scarcity of food. Due to the dependence of consumption on temperature and day-length, growth is positively correlated to these factors between 10$\sp\circ$C, the lower limit for growth, and about 20$\sp\circ$C. At higher temperatures growth slows down. These observations indicate that food availability in general does not limit growth until above 20$\sp\circ$C in the waters studied.    The number of recruited perch, i.e. the year-class strength, was found to be positively correlated to the abundance of fry in the autumn after the first growth season. These abundances were, in turn, positively related to the size of the fish at this time of life. Predation is probably the main regulating factor; a big individual is, at any time, less susceptible to predation. In order to predict maximal first year size, under certain temperature and day-length conditions, and hence relative year-class strength, a model was developed including timing of spawning, duration of embryonic development and growth rate.    The most important factors influencing first-year survival besides growth were finally concluded to be mortality during the first weeks of life due to food shortage or temperature drops and during the first winter due to starvation. The relative importance of these factors are discussed on the basis of field observations and laboratory experiments, respectively.

AN  - 303493372
AB  - Gray gulls Larus modestus are unique among birds of northern Chile as the only species nesting in the interior Atacama Desert, and the only seagull nesting far (30-100 km) from surface water. During breeding-nesting (August-February) gray gulls congregate on the coast of northern Chile where they feed and initiate courtship. As early as August, breeding pairs commute daily to the inner desert to establish nesting territories, round-trip distances of 60-200 Km. During incubation (30 days) and brooding (7 days) adults alternate daily foraging flights to the coast. Afterwards, both adults forage daily for their chick(s) until fledging (ca. 60 days). Foraging flights and thermoregulatory costs during the period of maximal solar radiation, when ground temperatures may reach 61 C in the day and drop to 2 C at night, have selected for adaptations which minimize those costs: tolerance of hypothermia and hyperthermia; dark plumage; low egg-shell water vapor conductance; low standard metabolic rate; elaborate repertory of thermoregulatory behavior which allow adults to take advantage of microclimatic variations in the desert and minimize costs relative to a sympatric congenor, Larus belcheri scheduling foraging flights to take advantage of optimal atmospheric conditions and presence of forage fish (anchovies) close to the surface; scheduling migration to coincide with anchovy production and levels of interspecific competition; and reduced clutch size ($\leq$ 2) relative to most seagulls. Periodic El Nino-Southern Oscillations (ENSO), which reduce principal food items of gray gulls, have selected for 'bet hedging' tactic by which L. modestus either ceases reproduction or varies clutch size between one and two, as observed during and after the 1982-83 ENSO.    During a typical reproductive season, breeding pairs allocate a minimum of 39 percent of their net metabolized energy (NME) to foraging flights. Including energy content of eggs, females have an overall reproductive effort (RE = reproductive costs/NME) of 35.1 percent of 122,086.8 KJ per year.

T1  - Selected aspects of the thermal relations and ecophysiology of the lizard Anolis carolinensis (Sauria: Iguanidae)
AN  - 303489680
AB  - This study was conducted to determine whether certain methods and variables may influence results obtained in tests of the thermal tolerance of reptiles. Knowledge thus gained then allowed an examination of the geographic variation in the thermal tolerance of adult male Anolis carolinensis.    Comparisons of body to ambient temperature were made using animals equipped with thermocouples (a commonly employed method) and animals whose temperature was recorded by insertion of a rapid-reading cloacal thermometer. Individuals with thermocouples averaged 0.5 C below and the individuals without thermocouples 0.4 C above ambient temperature. The cause of lowered temperature in subjects equipped with thermocouples was posited to be due to enhanced evaporative heat loss.    A test was conducted to determine whether acute handling and social stress lead to increased metabolic rate which, in turn, could lead to an unhealthy condition in subordinates of collectively housed lizards, lowering their thermal tolerance. Oxygen consumption and lactate accumulation were measured in individuals subjected to these forms of stress. Both were found to significantly increase rates of aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Collective housing of Anolis, and possibly other reptiles, before thermal testing may increase experimental error.    High temperature tolerance was compared in castrated individuals treated with either testosterone filled or empty silastic tubes, acclimated to 20 $\pm$ 2 C for 10 days. While the lizards were heated, the following responses were noted and body temperatures recorded at the onset of each: Escape movements, panting and onset of muscular spasms. No treatment effect was found for the response temperatures observed. Testosterone does not affect heat tolerance after low temperature acclimation in this species.    Three populations, along a latitudinal gradient, were tested for cold tolerance. After field determinations of the critical thermal minimum (cooling the subject until the loss of the righting response) yielded the appropriate acclimation temperature, the animals were acclimated to 9 C for 48 hours. Laboratory determination of critical thermal minimum revealed that the Tennessee population was significantly more cold tolerant than either Georgia or Florida populations (the latter two were not found to differ): this species consists of physiological races with regard to cold temperature tolerance.

T1  - SALINITY EFFECTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND LARVAL TOLERANCE OF FIVE SPECIES OF ECHINODERMS
AN  - 303487114
AB  - Salinity effects on the developmental rates, larval tolerances and various metabolic processes of five species of echinoderms were investigated. Development of Lytechinus variegatus (Lamarck), Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (O. F. Muller, 1776), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Stimpson, 1857), Strongylocentrotus pallidus (G. O. Sars, 1871), and Pisaster ochraceus (Brandt, 1835) larvae were observed. Developmental rates and larval survival to metamorphosis of S. droebachiensis and S. pallidus varied directly with salinity and were well within the observed salinity tolerance and distributional limits for the adults.    For each species, embryos and larvae at lower salinities (20, 22.5, and $25\sp{o}\!/\!\sb{oo})$ tended to develop more slowly than those at higher salinities. P. ochraceus and S. droebachiensis survived all salinity treatments throughout the experimental period. F$\sb1$ hybrid larvae exhibited salinity tolerances and developmental rates intermediate between values reported for the more stenohaline larvae of S. pallidus and those for the more euryhaline larvae of S. droebachiensis. S. purpuratus larvae were stenohaline and tolerated salinities as low as $27.5\sp{o}\!/\!\sb{oo}{\rm S.}$    Gonadal ninhydrin positive substances were significantly lower at $17.5\sp{o}\!/\!\sb{oo}{\rm S}$ and coelomic cavity lactic acid values were significantly higher at $20\sp{o}\!/\!\sb{oo}{\rm S}$ for S. droebachiensis and S. pallidus, although, histological examination revealed no observable differences in gonadal structure between adults acclimated to high and low salinity.    Temperature and salinity effects on the development, metabolic rates, and larval tolerance of Lytechinus variegatus (Lamarck) were also examined. Developmental rates and survival to metamorphosis of larval L. variegatus varied directly with salinity. Respiration rates of L. variegatus plutei varied directly with salinity and temperature; whereas, excretion rates varied directly with temperature and indirectly with salinity. O:N ratios suggest increased reliance on protein catabolism thus indicative of physiological stress at $27.5\sp{o}\!/\!\sb{oo}{\rm S.}$ The back transfer of juvenile L. variegatus to low salinities correlates well with 28 day LC$\sb{50}$ data of adults indicating $18\sp{o}\!/\!\sb{oo}$ to be the low salinity tolerance limit of adult urchins.    Data obtained from this study indicate that the larval tolerances of echinoderms may limit adult distributions along salinity gradients.

T1  - Reproductive performance, sex ratios, gonadal development, cold tolerance, viability and growth of red and normally pigmented hybrids of Tilapia aurea and T. nilotica
AN  - 303476914
AB  - Reproductive performance, sex ratios, gonadal development, cold tolerance, viability, and growth of red and normally pigmented hybrids of Tilapia aurea, T. nilotica, were evaluated.    Reproductive performance of red fish was similar to that for their T. aurea and T. nilotica ancestors. Mean fecundity ranged from 402 to 666 eggs.    Sex ratios differed among groups. In red tilapia males comprised 60 to 98% of the population while in normally pigmented siblings, males comprised 20 to 64%.    Gonadal development for T. aurea and their red and normally pigmented hybrids was different from that of T. nilotica and its hybrids. During October, gonosomatic index (G.S.I) values for females were: T. aurea (0.29%), red T. aurea hybrid (0.42%), normal T. aurea hybrid (0.78%), T. nilotica (2.41%), red T. nilotica hybrid (2.24%), and normal T. nilotica hybrid (2.74%).    Cold tolerance of red and normally pigmented hybrids was not different from that of their ancestors. Lower lethal temperature (LC50) values for T. aurea and their red and normally pigmented hybrids were 7.33, 7.35, and 7.22 C, respectively. LC50 values for T. nilotica and their red and normally pigmented hybrids were 8.28, 8.93, and 8.10 C, respectively.    Hatchability of red embryos was significantly lower than that of normally pigmented embryos. Survival of red fish during grow-out was significantly lower than that for their normally pigmented siblings. Cumulative mortality for hybrid red fishes was 58%; mortality for normally pigmented siblings was 34%. Mortalities for ancestral T. aurea and T. nilotica were 18 and 21%, respectively. Subviability was considered a negative pleiotropic effect of the red phenotype.    Red tilapia in all genetic groups grew faster than normally pigmented siblings. When treated with 17 $\alpha$-ethynyltestosterone, normally pigmented fish grew faster than red siblings. This difference in average gain was attributed to disproportion in sex ratios of red and normally pigmented fish and the superior growth of males.

T1  - Distribution, reproduction and growth in tanais dulongii (audouin)
AN  - 301506031
AB  - The principal aim of this study was to examine various aspects of the distribution, reproduction and growth of Tanais dulongii using a combination of field studies and laboratory culture and experimentation. The microdistribution of Tanais dulongii was investigated on two rocky shores in the Isle of Man. The type of habitat in which this species was found appeared to be determined principally by the tube-dwelling requirements of the animals. The abundance of T.dulongii within turfs of Laurencia pinnatifida varied with shore height as a consquence of the corresponding changes in the physical nature of the turf environment. The ability of T.dulongii to disperse to artificial habitats was demonstrated and males were shown to have a higher dispersive potential than females. The upper shore limit of distribution of this species was shown to depend on the availability of suitable habitats rather than on physiological tolerance limits. The development of Tanais dulongii was studied in laboratory-cultured animals and the instar sequence determined. The external characteristics of each instar are described. Field-collected specimens were assigned to specific instars on the basis of reproductive characteristics and various body measurements. The pattern of development was found to be gonochoristic with both sexes developing directly from a juvenile instar. Various aspects of the reproductive biology are described in detail. Female fecundity was found to be dependent on both size and environmental temperature. Temporal changes in population structure and abundance of a natural population indicated a seasonal pattern of reproduction. The laboratory growth of Tanais dulongii was studied in detail using a variety of culture regimes and was shown to be affected primarily by sex and temperature with salinity and photoperiod having negligible effects. The growth of both sexes is described in terms of the growth components: mould increment and intermoult period. Females grew more slowly than males, passing through a greater number of instars as their growth is regulated by their reproductive cycle. Increased temperature resulted in accelerated growth in males but this effect was less marked in females. Positive allometric growth was shown to occur in the chelae and antennules of both sexes. In males two growth phases were identified and these resulted in a male dimorphism between preparatory and copulatory instars. The adaptive significance of these growth patterns is discussed. Negative allometric growth of the pleopods was found in both sexes.

T1  - Reproductive biology of the bass, dicentrarchus labrax l
AN  - 1807921364
AB  - The bass, Dicentrarchus labrax L. exhibits a distinct seasonal reproductive cycle. The spawning period lasts for 4-5 weeks and occurs between April and mid-May for Gower bass. There is a close relationship between the timing of spawning and seawater temperature, spawning only occurring when the seawater attains a temperature of 9oC. From macroscopic and histological observations seven maturity stages can be delineated for developing ovaries of mature females. The reproductive strategy of the bass is characterised by: group-synchronous oocyte development, recruitment of successive clutches occurring from a large heterogeneous population of small oocytes at various stages of secondary growth; fractional spawning, 3-4 clutches being spawned in quick succession (within 10-12 days). All oocytes recruited into the secondary growth phase (viz. vitellogenesis) are either spawned that season or become atretic. Further the bass has a high fecundity (2-25 x 105), the small (1.20-1.25mm) pelagic eggs having a relatively short incubation period (4-5 days). Bass eggs exhibit a high degree of tolerance to both temperature and salinity, good survival occurring in the ranges 6-17oC and 20-39o/oo. Histological, histochemical and ultrastuctural observations indicate that two types of yolk inclusions are formed. Lipid yolk accumulates first as discrete droplets, followed by membrane-bound protein yolk granules. Protein yolk granules maintain their structural integrity through to maturation, forming a densely packed zone in the mid and outer cortex. Lipid yolk droplets coalesce and migrate centripetally forming a prominent zone of large lipid yolk droplets in the inner and mid cortex. Cortical alveoli ('carbohydrate yolk') are formed in the peripheral cytoplasm of secondary oocytes, and it is suggested that the golgi bodies are actively involved in their formation. Ultrastructural and biochemical evidence suggests that the protein yolk is exogeneous in origin, the lipid yolk is endogenous in origin.

T1  - FACTORS INFLUENCING SURVIVAL OF PREIMPLANTATION STAGE MOUSE EMBRYOS MAINTAINED IN DEVELOPMENTAL ARREST IN VITRO
AN  - 303548900
AB  - Preimplantation stage mouse embryos were maintained in vitro in developmental arrest. Various intrinsic and extrinsic factors were evaluated for influence on embryo survival including developmental age, mouse strain, culture atmosphere, protein supplement, media and temperature.    The most successful method for viable maintenance of embryos in developmental arrest involved reducing the culture temperature to 4(DEGREES)C (cold-culture). Later stage embryos were more tolerant to cold-culture than early stages. Part of this difference in tolerance was attributable to differences in the sensitivity of early embryos to the cold-culture environment. Survival of one-cell embryos improved when O(,2) tension of the culture atmosphere was reduced from 20% to 5%. One-, 2-, and 4-cell embryos also benefited from supplementation of media with bicarbonate. Later stage embryos were uneffected by either of these treatments.    The strain of mouse from which embryos were collected influenced the cold-culture tolerance of the embryos and heterosis for cold-culture tolerance was observed. Experiments designed to detect cytoplasmic inheritance for cold-culture tolerance were negative.    Embryos survival rate was highest at the lowest temperature tested (4(DEGREES)C). Many of the 2-cell embryos maintained at 30(DEGREES)C for 48 hours divided once during cold-culture (43/100) but failed to divide again following transfer to 37(DEGREES)C. These 4-cell embryos had a compacted appearance whereas, compaction normally occurs at the late 8-cell stage.    The results of this project provide information that should enable in vitro handling of mammalian embryos with reduced loss of viability over currently used methods.

T1  - ADAPTATIONS TO HYPOXIA IN FRESHWATER TRICLADS, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO DENDROCOELUM LACTEUM (MULLER)
AN  - 303505485
AB  - Preliminary observations on triclads in rivers, suggested that individuals in some populations were more tolerant to low PO$\sb{\rm 2}$ than others. In particular, those from organically enriched sites were best at tolerating these conditions. This study attempted to describe these environmental differences in more detail and tried to relate them to any possible physiological, biochemical or genetic differences between different populations.    This work has concentrated mainly on Dendrocoelum lacteum (Muller) and to a lesser extent Polycelis tenuis Ijima. All populations in this study were from the River Kelvin System situated on the west coast of Scotland, near Glasgow. Two sites were chosen with apparently large differences in organic input, and hence PO$\sb{\rm 2}$; the Allander Water, (N.G.R. NS 539769) situated downstream from a sewage effluent input and the River Kelvin (NS 568664), downstream from a weir. Diurnal and seasonal measurements of PO$\sb{\rm 2}$ were estimated and this showed that there were considerable differences in PO$\sb{\rm 2}$ between sites i.e. the Allander Water site was hypoxic more frequently and for longer periods of time than the River Kelvin site.    The tolerance of triclads to low PO$\sb2$ was measured in open and closed systems. These results indicated that Polycelis tenuis and Dendrocoelum lacteum were capable of surviving prolonged exposure to hypoxia and anoxia and that LT$\sb{50}$ values were affected by temperature, time of year, number of animals present, and nutritional state. Intraspecific differences were only considered for D. lacteum, and here individuals from the Allander Water had significantly higher LT$\sb{50}$ values than those from the River Kelvin (P $<$ 0.05). In general, animals lived longer at a low PO$\sb2$ after acclimation to hypoxia, but the intraspecific differences that persisted between populations before acclimation were also observed after acclimation. It should also be noted that these intraspecific differences also persisted in the F1 generations. Hence, there may be both environmental and genetic components in these differences.

T1  - A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF RESPIRATION DURING EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF THREE MARINE COTTIDS
AN  - 303480603
AB  - Effects of temperature, salinity and photoperiod on respiration during early development of three cottids were studied. Eggs of grubbies, Myoxocephalus aenaeus, longhorn sculpins, M. octodecemspinosus, and sea ravens, Hemitripterus americanus, were fertilized and developed in salinities ranging from 12.5-35 ppt (grubbies), 15-35 ppt (longhorns), and 20-35 ppt (sea ravens), in temperature-controlled baths at 2C, 5C, 8C (Myoxocephalus) and 8C, 11C, 14C (Hemitripterus). Oxygen consumption of individual grubby, longhorn sculpin and sea raven eggs increased with age and temperature. Oxygen consumption during embryogenesis was independent of salinity. Endogenous rhythms of oxygen consumption were not apparent.    Multiple regression models were developed, and indicated that metabolism during embryogenesis of the two genera differed markedly. Myoxocephalus embryos increased oxygen consumption due to age and interaction of temperature and age. Grubby embryos exhibited metabolic cold adaptation, compared to longhorn sculpins. Respiration in sea raven embryos increased with age and varied in a linear and curvilinear manner with temperature. Embryonic overwintering may represent a response to temperature and age. Residuals from the regression models demonstrated that oxygen consumption of gastrulae can be highly variable, development of blood is important in both genera and embryonic oxygen consumption is affected by activity and duration of the prehatch stage. An hypothesis suggesting that incubation in cold conditions should be favorable for demersal embryos is presented.    Oxygen consumption by prolarvae of Myoxocephalus declined during yolk absorption. The species exhibited different respiratory responses to salinity and alterations of temperature. Individual variation masked temperature and salinity effects on oxygen consumption by sea raven prolarvae, but decline of oxygen consumption during yolk absorption was significant.    Separation of grubbies and longhorn sculpins into estuarine and coastal spawning habitats, respectively, is promoted by low salinity tolerance of eggs, metabolic adaptation of embryos and temperature-salinity responses of larvae.    Variation in oxygen consumption by eggs and larvae was large and increased with rates of uptake. Variation in reproductive success of fishes may reflect the influences of abiotic factors on the metabolism of embryos and prolarvae, by affecting size at hatching or duration of yolk absorption.

T1  - NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF PACHYMEDUSA DACNICOLOR
AN  - 303466427
AB  - The embryological and larval development of Pachymedusa dacnicolor was investigated. P. dacnicolor belongs to the Phyllomedusinae (Leaf Frog) Subfamily of the Hylidae (Treefrog) Family. No complete developmental table for any member of the Hylidae exists. Therefore, this developmental table was produced for P. dacnicolor including stages from egg to the end of metamorphosis. The rate of development at different temperatures was included in the study.    Investigation revealed that the development of P. dacnicolor is similar to that of other anurans, but several differences were noted. Many of these differences relate to the fact that oviposition occurs in foliage out of water. Developmental peculiarities include:  (1) lack of an externally obvious grey cresent; (2) dorsal lip is located more dorsally than is usual; (3) appearance of what resembles a blister at earliest gastrulation (probably the thin roof of the blastocoel) along with an equatorial canal that briefly appears at stage 10.1 (beginning of gastrulation); (4) well developed subblastopore papilla, which develops into the anus; (5) fusion of the operculum begins in the midline and moves lateraly in both directions, but leaves a spiracle just lateral to the ventral midline on the left side; (6) the hind limb bud is short and thick; (7) in hind limb formation the second indentation appears before the first; (8) subarticular tubercles appear before the metatarsal tubercle develops. The most externally obvious difference between P. dacnicolor and other Anurans is the advanced state of development at hatching. Hatchlings are completely formed tadpoles, viz., they possess fully formed eyes, mouth, tail with fins, etc.    P. dacnicolor has no oral sucker. The gills of P. dacnicolor larvae are unusually long, and are probably indicative of the environmental constraints placed upon this frog: it is hypothesized that P. dacnicolor may exist close to the minimum physiological tolerance for O(,2) due to the high temperatures to which the egg masses are subjected. Temperature studies show best development is obtained at 30(DEGREES)C, which correlates well with temperatures reported in the field.

T1  - FACTORS INFLUENCING THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER AND D. SIMULANS BY THE PARASITOID, LEPTOPILINA BOULARDI (CALIFORNIA)
AN  - 303397197
AB  - Laboratory and field studies conducted during 1982-85 examined the influence of various factors on the ability of Leptopilina boulardi Barbotin et al. (Hymenoptera: Eucoilidae) to control populations of its hosts, Drosophila melanogaster Meigen and D. simulans Sturtevant (Diptera: Drosophilidae), in northern California. Factors investigated included (1) seasonal synchrony of host and parasitoid populations, (2) competition among parasitoid species for hosts, and (3) the functional response of L. boulardi.    Both fly species overwintered as adults, presumably in a state of quiescence. L. boulardi entered hibernal diapause as fifth instars within host puparia. In spring, reproductive activity of the hosts resumed 2-3 months before the reappearance of the parasitoid. Comparative developmental studies indicate that D. melanogaster and D. simulans have slightly lower thermal thresholds than L. boulardi (11.4 and 10.6(DEGREES)C, respectively, versus 12.8(DEGREES)C), and require significantly fewer degree-days (DD) to complete development from egg to adult (149 DD and 144 DD, respectively, versus 252 DD). Imperfect synchrony with seasonal occurrence and developmental cycles of its hosts appears to limit the control potential of L. boulardi in northern California.    Three parasitoid species attack D. melanogaster and D. simulans in northern California: L. boulardi, Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), and Trichopria drosophilae Perkins (Hymenoptera: Diapriidae). Data on the relative abundance, host exploitation efficiencies, and co-occurrence of these species within fruits were analyzed statistically for patterns indicative of strong interspecific competition. The results suggest that competition for hosts is negligible within the guild, and thus has little or no influence on the control potential of L. boulardi.    The functional response of L. boulardi to variations in density of D. melanogaster was measured in the laboratory. A behavioral criterion was used to assess attempts by parasitoid females to leave experimental arenas, and patch visits were terminated accordingly. The results demonstrate density-dependent oviposition behavior in L. boulardi over a narrow range of low host densities; however, at levels above 16 hosts/patch the response was inversely density dependent. Functional response "type" was ambiguous. Field studies indicate that the observed response would contribute little towards regulation of D. melanogaster populations because average host density within fruits far exceeds the narrow range over which parasitoid-induced mortality is directly density dependent.

T1  - Parental influences on egg quality, fry production and fry performance in oreochromis niloticus (linnaeus) and o mossambicus (peters)
AN  - 301444126
AB  - Reproductive traits, age of female broodfish and aspects of parental behaviour influencing the production and quality of fry in the mouthbrooding tilapia species Oreochromis niloticus and O. mossambicus were investigated. Two incubation containers (conical and round-bottomed) and rearing temperature were first studied to ascertain their effects on egg and fry performance. Partial agitation of eggs in round-bottomed containers significantly (P < 0.05) improved hatchability and success rate of fry production, by 17% and 25%, respectively, compared with conical containers. For the temperature trials only O. niloticus were studied. Two egg acclimation conditions were tested; these influenced the temperature range of hatching, hatching success and the upper and lower median temperature tolerance limits of artificially reared eggs. Thermal tolerance of eggs and fry decreased with progressive development and optimum (> 90%) survival and growth of swim-up fry occurred at 28°-3QoC. Hatching times were inversely related to temperature (P < 0.01) and rates of development to hatching were best described by a curvilinear relationship (P < 0.01). Growth rates, gross yolk utilization efficiency to maximum body weight, age at maximal body weight, onset of exogenous feeding and 50% irreversible starvation (point-of-no- return, PNR) were temperature-dependent. At 24•, 28' and 30' c (xi) maximum body weight occurred on days 18, 9 and 6 post-hatching, respectively, four days earlier than fry at 24' C. Similarly, PNR occurred on days 23, 20 and 18 at 24•, 28• and 30•C, respectively. Reproductive traits of 0+, 1+ and 2+ age-classes of broodfish were investigated. In O. niloticus mean dry egg weight and clutch weight were significantly (P < 0.05) different between all three age-classes, and yearlings produced the smallest eggs, whereas for total and relative fecundity only yearling females were significantly (P < o. 05) different to older broodfish. In both species broodfish age-class had no effect (P > 0.05) on egg:body weight ratio. In both species all reproductive traits were significantly related (P< 0.01) to female age, length and weight. The strongest influences were maternal age on egg size and maternal length and weight on total fecundity and clutch weight. The influence of maternal age and hence egg size on hatching time, and growth, survival, onset of feeding and PNR of fry developing solely on their yolk reserves was investigated. Larger eggs produced longer (P < 0.001) and heavier (P < 0.001) fry which sustained starvation stress longer (P < 0.001). Initial advantages of egg size on growth persisted through to 60 days post-hatching (P <0.05). Feeding success was improved by using of yearlings. For fry from fry from 1+ and 2+ females instead 0+, 1+ and 2+ O. niloticus and O. mossambicus females, PNR was reached on days 9, 12 and 12, and 12, 15 and 18, respectively. Delaying initial feeding beyond six days post-hatching significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the growth of fry. (xii ) Overall survival (between 6-20 days post-hatching) was improved by using older females. The effects of parental breeding behaviour on fry production and quality were investigated. Egg fertilizing capacity of males was inversely related to their number of spawnings in a day. During oral rearing cumulative fry damage increased linearly during the first eight days after spawning and plateaued at 25%-29%. Possible reasons for fry damage are discussed. Naturally reared fry were lighter (P < 0.05) than artificially reared 'siblings'. The implications of broodfish age and size and parental breeding behaviour for mass production of high quality tilapia fry and the need, advantages and feasibility of artificially rearing Oreochromis eggs and fry are discussed.

T1  - The effects of variations in diet, temperature and salinity on the development of cirripede nauplii
AN  - 1774333202
AB  - Previous work had established that acceptable diets for rearing larvae varied between different species of barnacles and such results had been summarised as suggesting that chthamalids preferred a flagellate diet and balanids a diatom diet. The present study was planned to examine this concept more critically and to evaluate the impact on dietary preference of using different salinities and temperatures. The criteria used to judge the success or failure of the rearing conditions were survival, rate of development, and size attained by the larvae. Various unicellular diets (mono or multi species) were tested with seven of the common British intertidal barnacle species. The larvae were dissected and detailed drawings of the antenna were made, including measurements of the intersetule distances. The size range of successful foods was found to be correlated with the mesh size of the antenna, which was confirmed by an experiment showing that the utilisable particle size increased in the later stages of development of Elminius modestus Darwin. There are also differences in the success of flagellates or diatoms which are related to the geographical distribution and the breeding season of the cirripede species, with warm-water summer breeders preferring flagellates and cold-water winter breeders preferring diatoms. Diatoms were often found to give larger larvae than flagellates where both were successful. Taxonomic distinctions between the cirripede species were also shown, with verrucids and chthamalids possessing a fine-meshed filter capable of filtering small flagellates while balanids lack such a filter. A further experiment demonstrated that varying periods of initial starvation resulted in a progressive increase in mortality and delay in development as well as producing smaller larvae. Four species of varying geographical range were used to determine temperature and salinity tolerances, and to study the interaction between these two factors. The varying response of these four species was related to their geographical range and habitat, and an acclimation to temperature during embryonic development was also demonstrated for Elminius modestus larvae. Interactions between diet and temperature and between diet and salinity were also shown for this species - diatoms were a better diet at colder temperatures while flagellates were better at higher temperatures; diatoms proved to be a better diet at sub- or supra-normal salinities.

T1  - Aspects of reproduction and behaviour in the lizard (Chalcides ocellatus).
AN  - 898760532
AB  - The skink Chalcides ocellatus Forskal (1775) was used to study aspects of reproduction in vivaparous lizards. A technique of cardiac puncture was developed to obtain repeated samples from individuals. Hormone levels were determined using RIA giving a range of 0 to 34.9 ng ml-1 oestrone and 0 to 40.44 mg ml-1 progesterone. The anaesthetic ketamine hydrochloride was tested and used at a dose of 70 mg kg-1. Laparoscopy was developed for sex determination. In a thermal gradient the skinks maintained a mean body temperature of 30.62<IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 0.03oC. The mean body temperature of a pregnant lizard (34.04 <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 0.19oC) was significantly higher (p***) than in non-pregnant females (30.43 <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 2.09oC) and males (27.79 <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 0.76oC). There is a large inter and intra-individual variation in temperature selection, and apparent seasonal and physiological effects. No correlation was found in females between any thermoregulatory parameter and reproductive hormone levels. Ovulation could be inferred from hormone changes. Mating occurred irrespective of almost any stage of follicular development. Repeat copulation seems to be necessary for successful conception. True gestation length is 40-50 days, the discrepancy is unresolvable due to sperm storage. The effects of environmental factors on reproductive activity were studied in controlled laboratory conditions, using A) constant 31oC, 14L:10D; B) constant 31oC 8L:16D; C) fluctuating seasonal conditions. Temperature appears to be the permissive factor, lizards from group A breeding nearly all year round, whilst B and C were limited to summer. The reduction in photoperiod by two hours postponed breeding by two months in group B. However, this could be attributed to their more recent exposure to natural cues. Superovulation trials failed to give reliable results. Reproductive behaviours have been observed, and found to be similar to other scincids. Sperm storage occurs in the deep clefts of the ciliated epithelium in the lower part of the oviduct. A short SEM study of the hemipenes has shown them to be a simple conical shape with little surface ornamentation. Some embryological details are described.

T1  - AN ECOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE INDIAN MEAL MOTH, PLODIA INTERPUNCTELLA HBN, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE EFFECT OF FOOD TYPE
AN  - 303418774
AB  - Three genetic lines (fast, intermediate, and slow) were isolated according to development time. Development time and survivorship, eggs per female, and sex ratio were correlated. Males outnumbered females in the fast line but not in the slow line. Males required less time to develop than females in all lines.    Space reduction affected survivorship and development rate. At the same density and with the same food type, survivorship was higher and development time was shorter in a jar (16-ounce) than in a cup (one-ounce). Increasing the egg density per container caused a high reduction in survivorship and caused a decrease in developmental rate.    Tolerance to starvation increased with the age of larvae. Larvae 14 days old survived up to 45 days without food. Corn-fed larvae were more tolerant to starvation than were wheat-fed larvae and last instar larvae starved continuously were unable to pupate. Male larvae required food in the last instar for at least one day and female larvae required food for at least two days.    Maximum survivorship of pupae and eggs occurred at 28(DEGREES)C but developmental rates were highest at 32(DEGREES)C. Food type did not affect the survivorship and developmental rate when eggs and pupae were subjected continuously to 20(DEGREES)C, 24(DEGREES)C, and 32(DEGREES)C. Continuous temperature extremes of 16(DEGREES)C and 32(DEGREES)C were lethal to both eggs and pupae. Eggs survived up to 12 days at 16(DEGREES)C and one day at 36(DEGREES)C, pupae survived up to 10 days at 16(DEGREES)C and up to four days at 36(DEGREES)C. The speed of development per day decreased when eggs were exposed to two days at 16, 20, and 24(DEGREES)C; however, with further exposure, speed of development in pupae was also decreased by exposure at these temperatures for periods up to 10 days and there was a slight increase just before adult emergence. Speed of development in pupae was also decreased by exposure at those temperatures for periods up to 10 days with a slight increase just before adult emergence. Eggs seemed more tolerant to low temperature than pupae. However, at high temperature, pupae were more tolerant than eggs.

T1  - METABOLIC RESPONSES OF THE ESTUARINE GASTROPOD THAIS HAEMASTOMA TO HYPOXIA (ENERGY CHARGE, OPINE DEHYDROGENASE,SURVIVAL, ADAPTATION, RESPIRATION)
AN  - 303405057
AB  - The hypoxia tolerance (LC-50) of Thais haemastoma was inversely related to acclimation temperature but was not related to acclimation salinity between 10 and 30(DEGREES)C and 10 and 30('o)/ooS. T. haemastoma is moderately tolerant to anoxia, the LT-50 (time to 50% mortality) being 12-22 days. Oxyregulatory ability varies from poor to good, and varies inversely with temperature. The oxygen consumption rate was lower after 28 days exposure to hypoxic conditions than at full oxygen saturation at all salinities at 20 and 30(DEGREES)C. Oxygen consumption was low at 10(DEGREES)C regardless of ambient PO(,2). Oxyregulatory ability in T. haemastoma did not show acclimation after 28 days exposure to 53 mm O(,2) at 30(DEGREES) and 30('o)/ooS. Likewise, no induction of the activities of the pyruvate oxidoreductase enzymes in foot tissue occurred after 28 days exposure to 10, 33, and 67% of oxygen saturation. The ratio of mean activities of alanopine dehydrogenase:lactate dehydrogenase:strombine dehydrogenase:octopine dehydrogenase was 3.8:1.2:1.0:0. Alanopine dehydrogenase activity nearly doubled on the first day but had returned to the control level by day 2, and no change occurred in strombine dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase activity over 6 days exposure to anoxia. The total concentration of cellular adenylates remained constant, but the adenylate energy charge, ( ATP  + .5 ADP )/( ATP  +  ADP  +  AMP ), was reduced at low PO(,2)'s. Arginine phosphate concentrations were lower in snails exposed to 10 and 33% oxygen saturation than in those at 67 and 100% of oxygen saturation. Energy charge declined from 0.79 to 0.58 after one day of anoxia at 30(DEGREES)C and 30('o)/ooS while the arginine phosphate concentration declined by 95%. There was no further decrease in either variable with longer exposure to anoxia. Hypoxia tolerance of T. haemastoma is due to a reduction in metabolic demand, especially at low temperature, with ATP production maintained at the expense of arginine phosphate while metabolism switches to anaerobic pathways. The opine pathway is probably only used as a transitional mode before use of long-term anaerobic pathways is initiated.

T1  - SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE RESPONSES OF FANTAIL (ETHEOSTOMA FLABELLARE), GREENSIDE (E. BLENNIOIDES), AND RAINBOW (E. CAERULEUM) DARTERS TO TEMPERATURE, DISSOLVED OXYGEN, AND SUBSTRATE TYPE (HABITAT SELECTION, DISTRIBUTION)
AN  - 303380711
AB  - Critical thermal maxima (CTMax) of fantail (Etheostoma flabellare), greenside (E. blennioides), and rainbow (E. caeruleum) darters varied seasonally. Values were highest in summer and lowest in winter. Field-acclimatized fantail and rainbow darters exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) higher CTMax values than the greenside darter; laboratory-acclimated darters did not exhibit similar interspecific differences. The three species exhibited greater capacity to increase CTMax in spring and autumn.    In a thermal gradient, the three species selected mean temperatures greater than the 5 C and 10 C acclimation temperatures. Only greenside darters acclimated at 20 C exhibited a mean selected temperature above 20 C. Estimated final temperature preferenda were below 20 C for fantail and rainbow darters, and above 20 C for the greenside darter.    Seasonal patterns in low oxygen tolerance were observed for field-acclimatized darters. Significant interspecific differences in tolerance occurred in summer; no differences were present in winter. In summer, rainbow darters were most tolerant of low oxygen (loss of equilibrium occurring at 1.64 mg O(,2)(.)1('-1)), fantail darters were intermediate (2.37 mg O(,2)(.)1('-1)), and greenside darters were least tolerant (3.39 mg O(,2)(.)1('-1)). In laboratory-acclimated darters, no interspecific differences in tolerance were observed at 10 C. Greenside darters acclimated at 20 C were significantly less tolerant than the other species.    Substrate preference tests revealed high similarity in substrate use among species in all seasons. Fantail and greenside darters, tested singly and in the presence of congeners, preferred the largest substrates (i.e. pebbles, cobbles-boulders). Rainbow darters used all available substrates with equal frequency. Though the similarity observed in substrate use suggests potential for competition, interspecific differences in morphology and in foraging methods and foraging areas may actually decrease competition for substrates.    Fantail and rainbow darters inhabit headwater and mainstream areas in many streams, whereas greenside darters are generally absent from headwaters. The responses to temperature and oxygen exhibited by these species may partly explain their distributions. Headwaters often exhibit extremes in temperature and oxygen; mainstream areas are more environmentally stable. The thermal preferences and lower temperature and oxygen tolerances of greenside darters may restrict this species to mainstream areas for much of the year. The higher tolerances of fantail and rainbow darters may reflect adaptations to the fluctuating headwater environment.

T1  - HOST-PARASITE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN COMPERIA MERCETI (COMPERE) (HYMENOPTERA: ENCYRTIDAE) AND SUPELLA LONGIPALPA (F.) (ORTHOPTERA: BLATTELLIDAE) (YEAST, SYMBIONT, REPRODUCTION, GLANDS)
AN  - 303372796
AB  - Studies conducted on Comperia merceti (Compere) to evaluate its potential as a biological control agent of Supella longipalpa (F.), included effect of temperature on developmental rate of C. merceti, critical thermal maxima for adult parasites and cockroaches, and oothecal age preference for oviposition by Comperia. The internal reproductive system of C. merceti is described and the morphology, life cycle, and possible significance of a yeast-like symbiont within C. merceti was investigated.    Developmental rate of Comperia merceti was determined at constant temperatures (18(DEGREES), 24(DEGREES), 30(DEGREES), 32(DEGREES), and 34(DEGREES)C). Developmental time decreased with increasing temperature and no parasites emerged at 34(DEGREES)C. Threshold temperature ((DEGREES)C) for development and the thermal constant (day-degrees) were 7.73 and 666.67, respectively. Supella developed at 34(DEGREES)C but failed to hatch if 2 or more embryos per ootheca died from oviposition by C. merceti.    Critical thermal maxima for S. longipalpa adults were significantly higher than for C. merceti, supporting field observations that S. longipalpa tolerates higher temperatures than its parasite. Inundative releases of C. merceti are recommended in habitats with temperatures below 34(DEGREES)C.    Comperia showed no ovipositional preference for oothecae of different ages.    Description of the female C. merceti reproductive system includes ovarioles, common oviduct, ovarian and deposited eggs, accessory glands, spermatheca, poison gland and reservoir, and Dufour's gland. The reproductive system resembles previously described systems in the Chalcidoidea, with the exception of an inner sac of microorganisms in the poison gland reservoir.    The yeast-like, non-pathogenic, microorganism is an extracellular symbiont, transmitted to offspring as a non-budding infective form via poison injected into the ootheca during oviposition. Its growth within the parasite, anatomical locations, and the physiological tolerance of the parasite to large quantities of yeast, indicate it may be a beneficial symbiont. Characteristic yeast ultrastructure is evident in electron micrographs. Based on gross cell morphology and vegetative reproduction, the yeast is placed tentatively in the Cryptococcoideae.    Attempts at producing aposymbiotic individuals failed. Elimination of the yeast from Comperia merceti may provide answers to the role it plays in the parasite.

T1  - FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FRAGILARIA CROTONENSIS KITTON "PULSES" IN THE PIGEON BAY WATERS OF WESTERN LAKE ERIE
AN  - 220000485
AB  - In recent years, increased biomass of Fragilaria crotonensis has been reported from the Pigeon Bay waters of western Lake Erie for reasons not fully understood. This apparent increase in F. crotonensis biomass has been influenced primarily by large summer "pulses". The purpose of this study was to identify the factors which contribute to F. crotonensis "pulses" in Pigeon Bay.    Summer not only provides optimal water temperatures for growth of F. crotonensis, but peak incident solar radiation and water transparency. It is hypothesized that the emergence of F. crotonensis "pulses" during summer is dependent upon three major factors:  (1) adequate supplies of nutrients (Si: via dissolution of biogenic silica and/or external loading; P: via luxury consumption and/or internal or external loading); (2) the presence of slight thermal stratification with concomitant wind velocities sufficient to keep F. crotonensis circulating in the surface mixed layer; and, (3) the presence of low turbidities with concomitant irradiance sufficient for growth. Once such physicochemical conditions exist in Pigeon Bay, it appears that F. crotonensis can grow rapidly (because it is adapted to low light and is a superior exploitative competitor for nutrients) and achieve densities as high as 950,000 cell L('-1). Such "pulses" may be terminated by lack of wind (which allows cells to sink out of the photic zone), high wind velocities (which increase turbidity and decrease light penetration), or depletion of nutrients. Zooplankton grazing on F. crotonensis is probably insignificant because of its large size and chain-forming morphology.    In discussing the factors which contribute to F. crotonensis "pulses" in Pigeon Bay, one must maintain a historical perspective. For example, summer nitrate:soluble reactive phosphorus ratios have increased from approximately four in the late 1960's to over 40 in the late 1970's and early 1980's. During this same time period, the summer phytoplankton shifted from being primarily nitrogen limited to being primarily phosphorus limited. Blue-green algal biomass declined while F. crotonensis biomass apparently increased. It is possible that this increase in summer nitrate:soluble reactive phosphorus ratios in Pigeon Bay may provide a more optimal environment for F. crotonensis growth. Laboratory work has shown that F. crotonensis has a relatively high N:P ratio (25) which is consistent with its increased biomass with increased N:P ratios in Pigeon Bay.

T1  - Properties of the cell surface of Aeromonas salmonicida
AN  - 2032469129
AB  - The properties of the cell surface of Aeromonas salmonicida were studied, with particular emphasis on the additional surface layer (A-layer), found on virulent strains. This was identified by electron microscopy, as having a tetragonal subunit morphology; and by electrophoresis of membrane components as a 51 kdal protein on A+ strains. A+ and A- strains, (the latter isolated by growth at elevated temperature), were compared biochemically and their interactions with various cell types investigated. Strains of A. salmonicida possessing the A-layer were shown to be more hydrophobic than those devoid of this protein. The influence of culture age, medium composition and subculture on hydrophobicity were investigated and hydrophobicity related to culture characteristics. No difference in enzyme susceptibility between A+ and A- A. salmonicida was found and both phenotypes showed similar tolerance to other environmental conditions. The interactions between A. salmonicida and cells in vitro were studied using adhesion and association assays involving radiolabelled bacteria, viable count determinations, haemagglutination and chemiluminescence. A+ A. salmonicida were found to adhere to a greater extent than A- bacteria to tissue culture cell lines and to isolated fish tissue by non-specific hydrophobic interactions. Adhesion was maximal to a fish epithelial cell line and the effects of various environmental conditions on adhesion were determined. A- bacteria more commonly exhibited haemagglutination which was inhibited by specific sugars. A+ bacteria associated more than A- organisms with mouse peritoneal macrophages and rainbow trout phagocytes when in salts solutions. The effects of opsonization on A. salmonicida were strain dependent. Incubation in a variety of sera resulted in a decrease in A+ surface hydrophobicity, often accompanied by abolition of characteristic autoagglutinability, whereas opsonized A- cells became more hydrophobic. These properties directly influenced the chemiluminescence response of trout macrophages.

T1  - THE EFFECT OF CONSTANT TEMPERATURES UPON THE WALNUT APHID, CHROMAPHIS JUGLANDICOLA (KALTENBACH) (HOMOPTERA: APHIDIDAE) (LIFE TABLE, DEVELOPMENT, FECUNDITY)
AN  - 303333823
AB  - Chromaphis juglandicola (Kaltenbach) was the subject of this study. It was determined that the thermal environment strongly, but differentially, influences development, reproduction and survival. A notational threshold for development through the nymphal stages was determined to be 8.4(DEGREES)C. The upper temperature limit of survival through all nyphal stages was estimated to be slightly above 30(DEGREES)C. Nymphal development took place most rapidly at 27(DEGREES)C. The total number of day-degrees above the threshold necessary to complete nymphal development of this aphid was 138 day-degrees.    Sexual females developed more rapidly than asexual females at 12(DEGREES)C, which was the only temperature at which sexual forms appeared.    Peak progeny production was reached within the first 24 hours after the adult molt. This initial burst of progeny production was proportionately greatest at higher temperatures, and slowly diminished with temperature until this initial burst represented a much lesser proportion of the total progeny production at the lowest temperatures.    Both indicies of reproduction that were examined, i.e., total fecundity and the mean length of reproductive life, peaked at 18(DEGREES)C.    Temperatures approaching either the upper or lower thermal limts of survival adversely affected survivorship to the to the adult stage while the mean length of life decreased with increasing temperature.    Age-specific fecundity and survival rates were determined for three constant temperature regimes (12(DEGREES)C, 27(DEGREES)C, 30(DEGREES)C).    The innate capacity for increase (r(,m)) for C. juglandicola varied with the thermal environment. This population growth statistic, in which the individual components of development, reproduction and survival are jointly evaluated, peaked at 27(DEGREES)C.    The population growth statistics, computed from the life table data, varied with temperature, with optimum values for the gross reproduction rate (GRR) and the net reproduction rate (R(,o)) recorded at 18(DEGREES)C.

T1  - SEASONAL, ANNUAL, AND INTERSPECIFIC CORRELATES OF THERMAL ACCLIMATION IN PLETHODONTID SALAMANDERS (CRITICAL MAXIMA, MINIMA, METABOLISM)
AN  - 303323765
AB  - In this study, the thermal acclimation of critical thermal minima (CTMin) and maxima (CTMax) were examined annually and seasonally in several species of plethodontid salamanders. The factors were considered relative to constant and cycling (thermoperiod) temperature regimes (Chapt. 1) and time courses of acclimation (Chapt. 3). Thermal hardening of CTMax and CTMin were also considered (Chapt. 2). Finally, seasonal and annual correlates were considered in the constant temperature and thermoperiod acclimation of metabolism in Desmognathus quadramaculatus (Chapt. 4).    Various species demonstrated the ability to undergo thermal acclimation of both CTMax and CTMin at different constant temperatures. The former seems to be well correlated with the ecogeographic distributions of these species, whereas the latter showed little interspecific variation. These animals showed an ability to acclimate to a thermoperiod by adjusting their CTMax and CTMin appropriately. These responses were best developed in highly terrestrial species such as Plethodon jordani and P. cinereus. Annual and seasonal differences existed among the CTMax and CTMin, but these did not fit any obvious adaptive patterns.    Hardening was, at best, poorly developed in the species studied here. In D. monticola, this phenomenon was highly body size dependent for both the CTMax and CTMin.    The time courses of CTMax and CTMin acclimation paralleled the interspecific trends reported in Chapter 1. The magnitude of acclimation was considerably greater for the CTMin than the CTMax. These responses were fairly stable annually, and the CTMin acclimation was altered seasonally in a manner corresponding to ecological constraints.    Thermal acclimation of metabolism in D. quadramaculatus differed considerably between constant temperatures and a thermoperiod. The temperature sensitivity for the latter was considerably reduced. There was no undercompensation at low acclimation temperatures, and metabolism proved to be highly stable on an annual basis. Some seasonal lability of metabolism was observed.    The temperature acclimation responses of these amphibians presumably influence their ecological success. In particular, the ability to selectively adjust their temperature tolerances and metabolic rates to cyclic temperature regimes may be crucial for their exploitation of the environment in light of considerable thermal variability.

T1  - AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN THE HEAT: EFFECT OF ACCLIMATIZATION (MUSCLE GLYCOGEN, PH, SUBSTRATE USE)
AN  - 303322881
AB  - The effect of heat acclimatization on aerobic exercise tolerance in the heat, and on subsequent anaerobic exercise performance was investigated. Ten male subjects were acclimatized by exercising 90 minutes per day for eight days in the heat (39.7 C db, 31.0% RH) on a bicycle ergometer at a workload corresponding to 54% of VO2 max. Prior to, and following heat acclimatization, the subjects performed six hours at intermittent, submaximal (50% VO2 max) exercise in the heat (HET). A 45 sec maximal bicycle ride was performed before (sprint 1) and after (sprint 2) each HET. Mean ((+OR-) SE) resting plasma volume was higher (+9.2 (+OR-) 1.7%) in acclimatized subjects (ACC) compared with unacclimatized (UN) subjects (P < 0.001). Acclimatization resulted in reductions in the mean exercise heart rate (160 (+OR-) 3 vs. 144 (+OR-) 3, P < 0.001) and mean rectal temperature (38.13 (+OR-) 0.08 vs 37.91 (+OR-) 0.05, P < 0.01). Muscle glycogen utilization during the HET was greater in the UN trial (57.4 (+OR-) 5.1 mmol/kg) than the ACC trial (28.6 (+OR-) 6.4 mmol/kg, P < 0.05). No differences were noted between the UN and ACC trials with respect to blood glucose, lactate (LA), or respiratory exchange ratio during the HET. Total work output during sprint 2 was reduced compared with sprint 1 in the UN trial (24.01 (+OR-) 0.80 vs. 21.56 (+OR-) 1.18 kJ, P < 0.05). Post exercise muscle pH was significantly (P < 0.05) higher following sprint 2 (6.86) than sprint 1 (6.67) in the UN trial. Associated with this reduction in anaerobic exercise performance, an attenuated accumulation of LA and fall in pH was noted in the blood. No differences between sprints 1 and 2 were observed for the ACC trial in total work, muscle pH, or blood LA. As a result of sprint exercise in both UN and ACC trials, a decrease in muscle potassium (K+) was noted (P < 0.05), which was accompanied by a 0.8 to 2.2 mmol/l increase in antecubital venous blood K+. Following sprint exercise, serum K+ was below pre sprint values for up to 15 minutes, suggesting a rapid and accelerated uptake of K+.    These data indicate that eight days of heat acclimatization produced a shift in fuel selection during submaximal exercise in the heat through an enhanced delivery of blood borne substrate. The observed muscle glycogen sparing during submaximal exercise may be associated with the enhanced ability to maintain high levels of anaerobic energy release and performance of highly intense exercise following prolonged exertion in the heat.

T1  - FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ACUTE LETHALITY OF ZINC TO RAINBOW TROUT
AN  - 303300009
AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine the influence of pH, water hardness, alkalinity, fish size, and prior exposure of fish to zinc on the acute lethality of zinc to rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri Richardson). Changes in toxicity were evaluated in terms of the chemical speciation of zinc, zinc bioaccumulation, and the induction of a metal-binding protein, metallothionein (MT).    Dissolved zinc was 10x more toxic at pH 9.0 than at pH 5.5, and 10x more toxic at low hardness (31 mg CaCo(,3)/L) than at high hardness (386 mg CaCo(,3)/L). At pH 7.0 and below, these pH and hardness effects were not caused by changes in the chemical speciation of zinc, or by changes in alkalinity. A balance between two competing mechanisms determined the effect of pH on total zinc toxicity. At successively higher pH levels, dissolved zinc became increasingly toxic, but was increasingly replaced by zinc precipitate, which is of very low toxicity to fish. The reduced toxicity of zinc at low pH and at high hardness was caused by a change in the uptake and/or excretion dynamics of zinc in gill tissue, such that a slower rate of accumulation of zinc was achieved.    Larger fish of 29.0 g were less tolerant of zinc than 1.7-g fish by a factor of 3, while fish of 18.2 g were less resistant than 1.3-g fish by a factor of 2.7. These effects of size resulted from an increased toxicity of zinc within the gills of larger fish.    Fish pre-exposed to 0.31-0.53 LC50 of zinc showed a 2.5-fold increase in zinc tolerance. This acclimation was fully induced within five days, and completely lost within seven days after fish were returned to zinc-free water. These tolerance changes were closely paralleled by changes in levels of heat-stable, sulfhydryl-rich protein (an estimate of metallothionein) in gill and liver, suggesting that MT is involved in the induction of enhanced tolerance. MT does not simply bind and store excess zinc in gill and liver, but may increase the ability of these tissues to regulate zinc levels, since acclimated fish accumulated zinc more slowly in gill tissue than control fish.

T1  - TEMPERATURE RESPONSES AND LIFE-HISTORY CHARACTERS IN 12 SPECIES OF DROSOPHILA (AGING, RESOURCES, BEHAVIOR)
AN  - 303286612
AB  - Mating, oviposition and pupation temperature responses, and adult longevity characters (survival curves, LT50, LT100 and range) were examined in 12 Drosophila species. Mating and oviposition temperatures were investigated at 3 ages.    Temperature Comparisons. Comparisons among 4 Drosophila species triads (virilis, repleta and melanogaster groups: two siblings and one non-sibling; willistoni group: 3 semispecies) from different ecological backgrounds (virilis: temperate-montane forest; repleta: desert; melanogaster: cosmopolitan; willistoni: tropical forest) reveal mating, oviposition and pupation temperature ranges that generally reflect geographic distributions: (UNFORMATTED TABLE FOLLOWS)        Common Ranges/Absolute Ranges (dC)        Species Groups    Mating    Oviposition    Pupation        virilis    3-30/3-34    9-32/6-34    4.5-36/3-38        repleta    9-34/9-36    12-36/10.5-38    6-38/4.5-38        melanogaster    10.5-32/6-34    10.5-34/7.5-34    4.5-34/3-38        willistoni    13.5-30/9-32    10.5-30/7.5-34    9-30/6-30(TABLE ENDS)    Within triad comparisons reflect species' distributions and suggest potential microniche differences. All 12 Drosophila species exhibit different combinations of temperature capabilities. Within species, temperature can affect each response differently. Among species, temperature can affect a particular response differently.    Results demonstrate distinctions between temperature limits on mating, oviposition and pupation, and conditions reported in the literature for tolerance/survival, developmental viability and resource utilization.    Age Comparisons. Most species show significant decreases in mating  and oviposition, an increase in response variability, and a narrowing of temperature ranges with age. The cosmopolitan melanogaster group shows the fewest age effects, whereas the shorter-lived repleta and willistoni groups show the most.    Mating and oviposition are both age- and temperature-dependent, and each response can be influenced differently by these factors. The relationships between age-dependent reproductive patterns and species' longevities do not conform to predictions of life-history models.    Diversity in age-dependent reproduction and longevity characters among species, demonstrates the value of a comparative approach for the study of aging. Observations of both rectangular and linear survival curves suggest potentially different aging mechanisms.    Phylogenetic Comparisons. Temperature responses cannot be used to predict similarities and differences among closely related species. Patterns of species differences can also change with age.    Within triad similarity in longevity characters reflects species' phylogenetic relationships. Results demonstrate, however, that comparisons should be carried out separately for the two sexes and that differences in one character cannot be used to predict differences in others.

T1  - Aspects of the ecology of the shrimp <i>Palaemon pacificus</i> (Stimpson) (Decapoda, Palaemonidae) in the Bushmans river estuary
AN  - 2137802305
AB  - The recruitment of Palaemon pacificus to the Bushmans River estuary was studied over a 12 month period. The dynamics of a population of shrimps in a small, tidal channel in the lower reaches of the estuary was investigated over a similar time span. Temperature and salinity tolerances of various stages and sizes of shrimps were compared in controlled experiments and are discussed in the light of the distribution and general ecology of the shrimp. Stage 6 zoeae and post-larvae entered the estuary on nocturnal flood tides throughout the year with peak recruitment occurring in March/April. The population of shrimps in the study site was predominantly juvenile for most of the year, with peak sub-adult numbers occurring in midsummer. The sex ratio was female-biased throughout the year except for short bursts of male predominance in February and April. Average growth rate was 0,043 mm carapace length per day. Maximum residence time in the study site was estimated to be four months and in the estuary at least six months. Flooding of the estuary resulted in a considerable reduction in juvenile numbers in the study site and some loss of sub-adults. Shrimps tolerated a temperature range of 4,3 to 30,9°C for 144 hours. Their long term tolerance range is probably narrower (10 to 28°C) because of the effects of temperature related factors such as starvation and disease. Their distribution in South Africa (Olifants River to Kosi Bay ) is consistent with this tolerance range. Sub-adults tolerated salinities of 1 to 79ppt and post-larvae 2 to 60ppt at 15°C for 144 hours. Low moulting success (low and high salinities ) and starvation (high salinities) would probably reduce these tolerance ranges to 2 to 56ppt (sub-adults) and 4 to 56 ppt (post-larvae). Higher and lower temperatures (10 and 20°C) reduced the tolerance of post-larvae to low salinities, but sub-adults were only affected at 30°C. Stages 4 and 5 and stage 6 zoeae were intolerant of salinities below 14ppt. The development of salinity tolerance with age is consistent with the retention of a marine breeding phase. It also explains the high loss of juveniles from the study site following the flood. It is postulated that recovery of the population after a flood would be fairly rapid except in extreme cases when estuarine vegetation is severely affected.

T1  - LABORATORY STUDIES RELATING TO DEVELOPMENT OF FEEDS AND FEEDING SYSTEMS FOR PENAEID SHRIMP
AN  - 303305887
AB  - Laboratory studies were focused on developing feeds and feeding strategies for efficient postlarval and juvenile penaeid shrimp rearing through experimental manipulation of environmental factors and feed nutrient composition. Each study tested two to four of the following species as available: P. setiferus, P. vannamei, P. stylirostris and P. aztecus.    Two supporting basic studies evaluated the effects of stocking density and timing of feeding (night or day) on the growth performance of juvenile shrimp. Stocking densities of about 40 animals/m('2) (60-80 g/m('2)) or less were found desirable to avoid limiting shrimp growth. Feeding the shrimp nocturnally (instead of diurnally) did not increase individual shrimp growth in the four species tested, although night-fed P. aztecus enjoyed significantly better survival and food conversion rate than those fed in the daytime.    A compounded diet's long-term acceptability to shrimp was found to be a better potential growth index than its immediate attractivity. Naturally present attractive substances leaching from feeds appeared to contribute more to their long-term attractivity than did an added attractant in a commercial ration. Low level inclusion of fish protein hydrolysate in diets (5% for juveniles; 10% for postlarvae) seemed beneficial to shrimp growth. Soybean-meal containing diets with most trypsin inhibitor destroyed permitted better shrimp growth than diets with the inhibitor.    Increasing dietary lipid level from 6 to 12% by adding fish oil depressed growth of young P. setiferus at 22, 26 and 30 C, and also reduced cold tolerance of animals acclimated to 22 and 26 C. The higher lipid diet increased cold tolerance, however, in animals acclimated to 30 C. Shrimp growth was greatly enhanced when the proportion of animal protein was increased in diets; small shrimp (0.1 g) responded more positively than large shrimp (4 g) to increased animal protein levels in diets.    A 100% Artemia nauplii diet was less effective in supporting early postlarval shrimp growth than one supplying only 40% of the 100% Artemia amount plus a compounded feed containing 42.5% protein. Increased temperature had a sparing effect on the need for Artemia in such combined diets.    P. vannamei outperformed the other three species in all growth trials, but was less tolerant to cold temperature than P. setiferus.

T1  - PHYSIOLOGICAL ECOLOGY OF FOSSORIAL MAMMALS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY (SPALACOPUS CYANUS)
AN  - 303260508
AB  - This study evaluates the significance of some physiological characteristics and their interpretation as adaptations to fossoriality in mammals.    An intraspecific study of the energetics in the South American rodent Spalacopus cyanus from low altitude and high temperature and from high altitude and low temperature indicates that the basal rate of metabolism is low in animals from both populations, but it is lower in the larger animals from high altitudes (74 vs 85% of the values expected from the Kleiber relation). Minimal thermal conductance is low in both populatons (80 and 85%, respectively). Tolerance to high ambient temperature is the same in both populations; however, it is attained by a low rate of metabolism at high altitude and by a small body mass at low altitude. These characteristics are interpreted as adaptations to reduce overheating, especially in the warmer burrows at low altitude.    In studying the thermal and metabolic response to low temperature and oxygen pressure, it was found that interspecifically the cirtical oxygen pressure was lower in fossorial than in surface dwelling mammals. Even though the basal rate of metabolism and body mass did not set P(,c), they may be of importance in reducing respiratory stress, because the development of hypoxia and hypercapnia is directly proportional to these factors.    Fossorial mammals scale basal rate of metabolism according to the fuction V(,bO(,2))/M(,b) = 9.752 M(,b) - 0.493. This function yields lower values than expected by the Kleiber relation at body masses larger than 74.5 g and higher values at small masses. The combination of this function and minimal thermal conductance determines a temperature differential between body temperature and the lower limit of thermoneutrality independent of body mass. Species that do not fit this pattern at small masses have low basal rates of metabolism, high minimal thermal conductances, live in warm environments, and are poor thermoregulators.    These characteristics are interpreted mainly as adaptations to reduce overheating. Although alternative hypotheses, e.g., that these modifications are related to hypoxia and hypercapnia, low food availability, and the high cost of burrowing, should also be considered.

T1  - FREEZING TOLERANCE IN THE INTERTIDAL LIMPET COLLISELLA DIGITALIS
AN  - 303130079
AB  - Certain intertidal molluscs can survive ice formation in their tissues, but the mechanism by which they avoid lethal damage is unclear. We show that the intertidal limpet Collisella digitalis uses a multifaceted strategy to survive low temperature stress. The limpets exhibit an appreciable ability to supercool. Supercooling points are depressed by increases in internal osmolarity; however, the amount of this supercooling point depression is not as great as predicted by the physical properties of the equilibration solutions. The limpets seem to produce a substance which promotes freezing in their tissues.    C. digitalis survives ice formation in its tissues. The basic freezing tolerance is unaffected by changes in acclimation temperature, but is strongly influenced by changes in acclimation salinity. In contrast to other intertidal molluscs, these increases in freezing tolerance are not simply a function of the changing concentrations of divalent cations.    Because of the similarity of the stresses imposed, the osmotic responses of the limpets to changes in salinity are investigated. Measurements of total water content, intracellular water content, and primary amine levels suggest that C. digitalis does not tightly regulate its cell volume in the face of fluctuating external osmolarities. These data are used to show that the changes in freezing tolerance resulting from changing acclimation salinity are correlated with changes in the concentrations of two known cryoprotectants--glycerol and amino acids.    The similarity between values obtained for lethal water loss via either osmotic dehydration or freezing suggest that these two processes share mechanisms of injury and that freezing damage in C. digitalis is caused by the dehydration produced by extracellular ice formation. This dehydration is commonly thought to produce lethal damage either by reducing cell volumes below some minimum tolerable limit or by increasing solute concentrations to some toxic level. A comparison of the amounts of ice formed at the lethal temperatures for limpets acclimated to a variety of salinities with their corresponding cell volumes shows that regardless of the acclimation conditions, the limpets seem to be sensitive to the removal of a critical percentage of their original water content, despite the fact that this yields different final cell volumes and different final solute concentrations.

T1  - PATHOBIOLOGY OF BURENELLA DIMORPHA JOUVENAZ AND HAZARD (MICROSPORA: MICROSPORIDA)
AN  - 303068709
AB  - Burenella dimorpha Jouvenaz and Hazard is a host-specific, dimorphic microsporidium that parasitizes the tropical fire ant, Solenopsis geminata (F.). The red and black imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren and Solenopsis richteri Forel, can be infected perorally by B. dimorpha, but the parasite survives only a few generations in colonies of these factitious hosts. Nine species of ants other than fire ants (representing eight genera) were refractory to infection.    Infected pupae develop pathognomonic signs (eye teratology and blister-like clearings in the occiput and petiole) that are due to destruction of the cuticle. In an advanced stage of disease, the pupa ruptures and is cannibalized by worker ants. The spores and other particulate matter are not ingested, but are diverted to the infrabuccal cavity, formed into a pellet, expelled, and fed to fourth-instar larvae only. The intracolonial cycle of infection is thus from ruptured, diseased pupae to fourth-instar larvae via the adults, who are mechanical vectors. The binucleate, nonpansporoblast membrane-bounded (NMB) spores are infective perorally for larvae; the uninucleate, pansporoblast membrane-bounded (MB) spores are not infective, and their function is unknown. These spore types are tissue specific: NMB spores develop from disporous sporonts in the hypodermis; MB spores develop in octets from multinucleate sporonts in the fat body.    The development of MB spores is temperature-dependent. The lower thermal threshold for MB spore development is between 20 and 22.5 C; the upper thermal threshold is below 32 C. A hypothesis is advanced that these limits are set by the stability of an enzyme(s), and that the physiological function blocked in MB sporulation is meiosis.    Burenella dimorpha has two cycles of merogony (vegetative multiplication). The meronts of the first cycle were originally described as uninucleate cells that become binucleate and divide. However, these nuclei are actually pairs of nuclei in a diplocaryotic arrangement.    Surface structure has been seen for the first time in MB spores. The surface of NMB spores is smooth.

T1  - Studies on the acclimation of commercially cultured sarotherodon species to sea water
AN  - 301407093
AB  - The initial aims of the present study were to investigate the problems associated with salt water transfer in Sarotherodon spp. with the objective of maintaining high rates of survival and satisfactory growth rates. Members of the euryhaline commercially cultured Sarotherodon species viz. Sarotherodon aureus, S. mossambicus, S. spilurus, S. niloticus and the hybrids of S. aureus/S. niloticus were used. The specific salinity tolerance and the capability of tolerating direct transfers to specified salinities and the comparative abilities of surviving gradual increases of salinity up to full strength sea water were investigated. The involvement of the plasma osmotic concentration in the osmoregulatory process, and the physiological changes following the direct transfer to salt water were examined with special reference to the possibility of using changes of plasma osmotic concentration as an indicator of fish transferability. S. aureus proved to be best able to withstand salinity changes, though in all cases gradual transfer was required to limit mortalities. Feeding of high dietary sodium chloride diet was evaluated for S. mossambicus and S. aureus/S. niloticus hybrids as a method of stimulating osmoregulatory process prior to salt water transfer. This was found to alleviate only slightly the osmotic stress following direct transfer to a known lethal salinity. Water deterioration and temperature fluctuation during fish transportation are inevitable, especially after long journeys. The effects of water quality deterioration, temperature fluctuation and food deprivation, typical of transport conditions, were studied in combination with salinity transfer effects. Effects were significant in all cases though, of the species studied, niloticus appeared to show the highest resistance to the combined effects. Following full acclimation to full strength sea water, the effects of prolonged exposure to sea water on the subsequent survival, growth rates and food conversion were investigated. S. niloticus and the hybrids of S. aureus/S. niloticus were found to be less tolerant to long-term exposure than the other candidates, which were selected for further detailed study. Light and electron microscopic studies of the gills and chloride cells were carried out in S. mossambicus and S. spilurus. This study showed the modified role of the chloride cells in fresh and sea water environments. Increases in number and developments of the ultrastructure of these cells were observed in sea water adapted samples from both of the species. Consequently the significance of the chloride cells in the osmoregulatory process was discussed. The significance of these results was considered in terms of aquaculture practice and suggestions are made for improved transfer methods in this context.

T1  - Monosex culture of tilapia (Tilapia mossambica) in brackish water using kangkong leaves and camote tops as supplementary feeds
AN  - 2032472118
AB  - This study entitled, 'Monosex culture of male tilapia (Tilapia mossambica) in brackish water using kangkong leaves and camote tops as supplementary feeds' was conducted at the Aklan National College of Fisheries Experimental Fishpond, located at Barangay Briones, Kalibo, from April 7 to September 24, 1981. This study was undertaken to improve the production of Tilapia mossambica cultured monosexually in brackish water using kangkong leaves and camote tops as supplementary feeds. This study hopes to provide information in predicting yields and guiding management practices, like manual sexing of tilapia, kinds of feeds, and the amount of feeds to be given. Five compartments numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with an area of 336 square meters, 373 sq. meters, 317 sq. meters and 385 sq. meters, respectively were used. The writer had her experiment in compartment no. II. Compartment numbers 1, 2, and 3 were used for the culture of male tilapia, while compartments numbers 3, 4 and 5 were utilized for female tilapia. These compartments were prepared, following the steps as clearing the pond, leveling, checking of leaks and seepages, drying, application of organic fertilizers, introduction of water and growing of natural food. Manual sexing and stocking had been completed on June 24, 1981 at a stocking rate of 1.1 (In every square meter of the area on tilapia stocked). After consuming the natural food in the pond, each trained fed the fish with chopped kangkong leaves and camote tops at the ratio of 5%, 4% and 3% in ponds number 1, 2 and 3 stocked with male tilapia, 4% and 3% in ponds numbers 4 and 5 stocked with female tilapia, respectively. Water parameters had been monitored at three days interval. Sampling of the stock at fifteen days interval had been done. The stock was harvested on September 24, 1981. At the end of the research, 351 tilapia were recovered or 93.83% of survival. The average length was 17.63 centimeters with an average depth of 5.46 centimeters. The average weight was 79.27 grams. It was proven that 4% to 5% of the supplementary feeds given enhanced the rapid growth of tilapia. After the study, the researcher analyzed and interpreted the data. Conclusions were drawn basing on the observation of the study. Based from the results of the study the writer has the following conclusions: 1. That and female sexes of tilapia are differentiated from each other through the number of genital opening. Male has one papilla for the exit of urine and milt or sperm, female have two papilla for the passage of urine and the other for the passage of eggs. Male tilapia grows faster than female. Male tilapia builds nest on the pond bottom that made irregularities on the contour of the soil. Tilapia mossambica tolerates the sudden change of temperature. 2. Chopped kangkong leaves and camote tops given at a feeding ratio of 4% of the total weight of tilapia to attain a rapid growth. Supplementary feeds helped in the fattening of the stocks. Supplementary feeds made flesh of tilapia more palatable than tilapia without supplementary feeding. 3. Supplementary feeds add fertility of the soil. Tilapia mossambica consumes lab-lab, algae, as well as kangkong leaves and camote tops as supplementary feeds, tilapia response to supplementary feeds like kangkong leaves and camote tops. 4. Monosex culture of tilapia prevents overcrowding in the pond. The growth rate of tilapia from juvenile to marketable size is faster if there is an abundant food in the pond. Based from the foregoing conclusions, the trainee has the following recommendations: Proper manual sexing and examination of tilapia should be observed to avoid mixture of female sex composition thus, production will be avoided; constant checking of leaks and seepages should be done to assure no loss of supplementary feeds given to the stock as well as to avoid the loss of stock and to maintain the depth of pond water; supplementary feeds must be given to the stock at one day interval either in the morning or late in the afternoon. Be sure to chop kangkong leaves and camote tops before giving to the stock so that it would be easy for them to chew; proper screen of the gates to avoid the entry of undesirable species; increase the water depth of about twenty five to thirty centimeters when ready for stocking; and the total draining is the most effective harvest for male tilapia so that total harvest for male tilapia could be acquired.

T1  - The impact of industrial development in the teesside on local air quality
AN  - 1794158485
AB  - A most important aspect of effects of air pollutants on air quality is their impact upon visibility. As far as can be determined this is the first visibility study performed in the UK in which the influence of individual pollutants, the local microclimate and the long range transport of air pollutants have been simultaneously examined over the whole visibility range. Techniques were developed to analyse the influence of the relative humidity on the light scattering efficiency of hygroscopic particles, and to examine their nature and size distributions. A regression model that specifically included the influence of hygroscopic particles and the relative humidity accounted for over 80% of the total variance in visibility, and showed that over 50% of the visibility degradation was due solely to the presence of sulphate particles. The constant of the regression implied a background visibility of over 60km for Teesside, whereas a mean of 12km was recorded. Original results were obtained by examining the relationship of atmospheric stability and thermal structure to visibility and pollutant behaviour using an acoustic sounder. This was used to investigate the conditions created by the local sea breeze which was associated with a substantial proportion of the summertime hazes. Wind rose analysis of the role played by emissions from Teesside industries together with comparisons of visibility levels at nearby locations showed that 20-40% of the light extinction was due to local factors. An airstream categorisation scheme was developed to study the role of long range transport of air pollutants and other influences on visibility. The study was extended across the British Isles to produce convincing evidence of large scale visibility degradation, due principally to sulphates derived from sulphur dioxide emissions, from sources as distant as 1500km. At Teesside the elimination of local air pollutant emissions would result in a significant but limited visibility improvement. A most effective means of controlling visibility degradation would be the reduction of sulphur dioxide emission to the atmosphere on an international scale. The resulting improvement in the visibility levels experienced at Teesside and in the UK in general would be in the order of 100% or more.

T1  - THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE WOOD BORING ISOPOD LIMNORIA IN TEXAS ESTUARIES AND BAYS IN RELATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
AN  - 303213359
AB  - The gribble Limnoria tripunctata and other members of the family Limnoriidae annually cause millions of dollars of damage to wooden structures in the marine environment. Thus it is of considerable economic importance to understand the factors which control the distribution of gribbles. The objectives of this study were:  (1)to determine the geographic distribution of gribbles in Texas bays, (2)to determine tolerances of L. tripunctata to temperature and salinity in the laboratory, and (3)to correlate field distribution, laboratory tolerances, and hydrographic conditions in the study area.    Wood samples were collected from pilings at 33 stations located in Galveston, Matagorda, San Antonio, Aransas, Corpus Christi, and Baffin Bay systems and the Laguna Madre. Limnoria tripunctata, the only gribble species collected, was present in samples from Bolivar ferry landing, Texas City Dike, West Bay, Christmas Bay, Freeport, Port O'Connor, Port Aransas, Corpus Christi, Kennedy Causeway, Port Mansfield, Port Isabel, and Brownsville. This species has previously been reported from Galveston, Freeport, Port Aransas, Corpus Christi, and Port Isabel. Salinity and water circulation appeared to be the most important factors governing the local distribution of gribbles. Mean salinity (from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Coastal Fisheries Projects Reports, 1963-1975) was greater than 19('o)/oo at positive stations and less than 22('o)/oo at negative stations. Most positive stations are near passes and are affected by tidal exchange between the Gulf of Mexico and the bay system.    Limnoria tripunctata for the laboratory tolerance study were collected in winter and summer at the Texas City Dike in Galveston Bay. The animals were maintained on filter paper at a series of water salinity-temperature combinations. Experimental salinity range was 10-50('o)/oo, and temperature range was 5-35(DEGREES)C. Maximum survival occurred at 30('o)/oo salinity and at a temperature of 10(DEGREES)C in winter and 20(DEGREES)C in summer. The results suggest that seasonal temperature acclimation increases chances for survival at prevailing water temperatures. Animals acquire cold resistance in winter without loss of heat resistance and are able to tolerate the wide temperature fluctuations which occur on the Texas coast in winter. Animals are exposed to less temperature variation in summer but must tolerate higher temperatures. Warm acclimation reduces cold resistance and raises the upper temperature limit.    The presence of L. tripunctata from Galveston to Brownsville indicates that environmental conditions favorable for this species occur along the entire Texas coast. Temperature conditions are favorable throughout the year, although laboratory studies suggest that highest summer (> 30(DEGREES)C) and lowest winter (< 10(DEGREES)C) temperatures are stressful. Results of the field and laboratory studies suggest 20-40('o)/oo as the salinity range for successful establishment of L. tripunctata in Texas bays.

T1  - LIFE HISTORY AND ECOLOGY OF ALMYRACUMA PROXIMOCULI JONES AND BURBANCK, 1959 (CRUSTACEA: CUMACEA)
AN  - 303207776
AB  - The estuarine cumacean Almyracuma proximoculi is found year-round, predominantly in the uppermost centimeter of sediment, in the immediate vicinity of intertidal freshwater springs in the northeastern United States. These areas are inhabited by a typical estuarine peracarid crustacean fauna, and this species is the numerically dominant peracarid in this habitat, with typical densities ranging from 2,000-5,000/m('2). The combination of small annual temperature changes and large semidiurnal salinity fluctuations make these areas unusual intertidal habitats. Laboratory studies of this species' tolerance of salinity/temperature combinations involving salinities ranging from distilled water to 32 ('0)/00 and temperatures from 0(DEGREES) to 20(DEGREES)C indicate high survival rates at combinations involving salinities of 0.25 ('0)/00 or greater and temperatures of 10(DEGREES)C or less. Its low survival rates at 20(DEGREES)C probably explain its inability to become established in other local, more typical estuarine habitats, which usually exceed this temperature in summer.    Each of two intensively studied populations of A. proximoculi synchronously produce two generations per year. The following developmental stages occur: first manca, second manca, juvenile, juvenile male, mature male, juvenile female, preparatory female, marsupial female, and intermediate female. There are minor differences in life history parameters between populations and major differences between generations. Compared to the overwintering generations the summer generations have more rapid within-marsupium and post-marsupium developmental rates, have lower fecundity, are shorter-lived, and produce smaller adults. These differences are apparently due to the influence of ambient temperature.    A. proximoculi is the least sexually dimorphic cumacean known, due to the progenetic condition of the male. The most distinct sexually dimorphic characters present in the male are the greater spination of the uropods and the greater thickness and length of the abdomen, uropods, third maxillipeds, and first pereopods. These all facilitate the rapid removal of the female's exuvia during the fertilization molt. The typical combination of male cumacean morphological characters, which facilitates motility and chemoreception, is not present in A. proximoculi. These characters are maladaptive for an infaunal existence and are apparently unnecessary in this species, which lives in dense, intertidal populations.

T1  - CRITICAL THERMAL MAXIMA AND THERMAL TOLERANCE IN SMALL MAMMALS
AN  - 303188848
AB  - The critical thermal maximum (CTM) was used to assess thermal tolerance in Mus musculus acclimatized to two photoperiods (LD 12:12 or LD 18:06, photophase centered at 1200 CST) and four thermal regimes (15(DEGREES)C, 25(DEGREES)C, 30(DEGREES)C or a 15 to 30(DEGREES)C cycle, LD 12:12). Mice acclimatized to LD 12:12 (25 (+OR-) 1(DEGREES)C) had a unimodal diel cycle in CTM while mice exposed to LD 18:06 (25 (+OR-) 1(DEGREES)C) displayed a bimodal cycle in CTM. Acclimatization to constant temperatures (LD 12:12) had no effect on CTM but acclimatization to a cycling thermal regime significantly increased the CTM. These data support the suggestion of susceptibility-resistance cycles to heat stress and indicate that the CTM of endotherms can be altered by internal and external modifying factors.    The CTM was then used to compare the thermal tolerances of five species of small mammals (laboratory mice, Mus musculus; white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus; gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus; laboratory rats, Rattus norvegicus; kangaroo rats, Dipodomys ordi). All animals were acclimatized to 25 (+OR-) 1(DEGREES)C and an LD 12:12 photoperiod. The CTM of D. ordi was significantly higher than that of all other species. The CTM of M. musculus was lower than the CTM of all other species. The CTM of P. leucopus was lower than that of R. norvegicus. There was no difference in CTM between M. unguiculatus and R. norvegicus.     The CTM appears to be an easily determined measure of thermal tolerance that can be applied to small mammals in much the way that the technique has been used with ectotherms. However, acclimatization and testing procedures should be standardized to allow meaningful comparisons in future studies.

T1  - COMPARATIVE ECOLOGY OF GREAT BASIN RATTLESNAKES (CROTALUS VIRIDIS LUTOSUS) AND GREAT BASIN GOPHER SNAKES (PITUOPHIS MELANOLEUCUS DESERTICOLA) AND THEIR IMPACT ON SMALL MAMMAL POPULATIONS IN THE SNAKE RIVER BIRDS OF PREY NATURAL AREA
AN  - 303150307
AB  - Capture data from southwestern Idaho indicate only moderate differences in activity and thermal ecology between C. viridis and P. melanoleucus. P. melanoleucus are more vagile than C. viridis. Females from both species reproduce for the first time in their fourth year. Male C. viridis had spermatozoa present in the vas deferens in the fall of their second year, while male P. melanoleucus reached this condition in late summer of their third year. Ovulation occurred in early June for both species. Limited observations indicate that young c. viridis are born from mid-September to early October, while P. melanoleucus hatch in October, suggesting a shorter developmental period for the live-bearing C. viridis. Mean clutch sizes were 8.3 and 6.9, respectively, for C. viridis and P. melanoleucus. Annual reproductive effort was about 0.4 for females of both species. However, all mature female P. melanoleucus reproduce annually, while only 70% of the mature female C. viridis reproduce annually. Fat bodies were used primarily for reproduction in both species.    Based on drift fence captures, mean densities were 0.6 and 1.3 snakes/ha, respectively, for C. viridis and P. melanoleucus. The distribution of C. viridis was patchy while P. melanoleucus was more uniformily distributed throughout the study area. More than 80% of the adult diet of C. viridis was composed of Spermophilus townsendi, while P. melanoleucus took a variety of small mammals.    Feeding studies with captive snakes indicated annual consumption rates of 300% body weight for young and 160% body weight for adult C. viridis. P. melanoleucus had corresponding annual consumption rates of 220% and 150%, respectively, for young and adults. Production efficiency (total production of body tissues/total weight of ingested prey) was 30% and 28%, respectively, for young and adult C. viridis, and 24% and 20%, respectively for young and adult P. melanoleucus. C. viridis annually take an estimated 25% of the Spermophilus townsendi in the study area, while P. melanoleucus take 10% of the S. townsendi, 20% of the Sylvilagus nuttalli and 10% of the Peromyscus maniculatus.

T1  - EFFECTS OF BASKING ON THE BIOLOGY OF THE CANYON TREEFROG, HYLA ARENICOLOR COPE
AN  - 303092328
AB  - A population of Canyon Treefrogs was studied at Marijilda Stream, Arizona, to determine how they are adapted to the ecological niche they occupy. Life-history traits, including reproductive parameters, larval growth and development, postmetamorphic growth, and population structure and dynamics were quantified. Reproductive behavior is initiated at the lower limiting temperature for larval development. Mature females lay one clutch per year, and relative and absolute clutch sizes are positively correlated with female body size. Viability, developmental rate, and probability of desiccation of clutches are affected by female choice of oviposition site.    Postmetamorphic growth is rapid, and growth in length is described by a decaying exponential function. Males grow faster than females but have a shorter mean asymptotic length. Growth rate is positively correlated with mean monthly air temperature.    The adult population approximated a 1:1 sex ratio. Population size varied within and among years and varied from a maximum of about 5,000 individuals to a minimum of about 250 individuals on a 400 m transect. Survivorship through embryonic and larval stages is low and greatly affected by environmental conditions. Postmetamorphic survivorship is higher and appears to increase with age. Major causes of mortality are desiccation and predation.    In all but the coldest months of the year, Hyla arenicolor perch on boulders exposed to sunlight. Adults cease basking during rain and in late summer. Frog body temperatures (T(,b)) varied from 12.3 C to 35.8 C. Some individuals attained T(,b) higher than ambient air temperature. T(,b) of frogs perched in sunlight were significantly higher than of those in shade. T(,b) correlated best with substrate temperature.    High body temperature promotes rapid growth and basking sites inhibit predation. Costs of basking include water loss and increased O(,2)-consumption rate.    Oxygen consumption of Hyla arenicolor was measured at 15 C, 25 C, and 35 C; water-loss rate and desiccation tolerance were measured at 15 C and 25 C. O(,2) consumption rates ranged from 83.6 (mu)l O(,2)g('-1)h('-1) at 15 C to 280.2 (mu)l O(,2)g('-1)h('-1) at 35 C. Metabolic rate exhibited thermal compensation between 15-25 C and thermal sensitivity between 25-35 C. Oxygen consumption rates showed seasonal acclimatization to temperature at 35 C.    Water-loss rates for frogs were lower than those of free water surfaces at 15 C but similar to free water surfaces at 25 C. Hyla arenicolor apparently have no special physiological adaptations for high heat loads and desiccating conditions, but rely on abundant free water supply and evaporative cooling.

T1  - BIONOMICS OF THE GREEN LACEWING CHRYSOPA CARNEA STEPHENS (CHRYSOPIDAE: NEUROPTERA) IN ARIZONA
AN  - 303090629
AB  - Chrysopa carnea Stephens is widely distributed throughout the world. The larva is a potential control agent of pests in greenhouses, field crops and orchards. Its use as a biocontrol agent in integrated control is enhanced by its tolerance to some insecticides. Because of its considerable usefulness, studies to investigate the bionomics of this predator under both laboratory and field conditions were initiated.
The study of population dynamics in alfalfa fields indicated that the major factors which govern the fluctuation of Chrysopa are: climate, food (e.g. aphids), diseases, parasites and agricultural practices (e.g. cutting of alfalfa hay). In each year and for each field, it was apparent that population levels of larvae rose to peaks five to six times; this suggests that there are five to six generations per year.
The study of the effect of temperature and photoperiod on development in the laboratory showed that the egg, larva and pupa responded significantly to both temperature and photoperiod and an interaction between these two parameters was detected. Relative to fecundity and longevity, the investigations revealed that there was a photoperiod response only with respect to number of eggs laid and preoviposition period and that interaction between temperature and photoperiod was absent. In the case of the oviposition period, a response to temperature was detected and interaction between temperature and photoperiod existed. The different regimes had no significant effect on longevity of either sex.
Consumption of prey differed significantly–being highest with beet armyworm eggs (Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) followed by corn earworm (Heliothis zea (Boddie) and tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens (Fabricius). Fewer pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) were consumed than any of the lepidoterous eggs.
Resistance to starvation differed significantly among the three instars; the newly-emerged Chyrsopa larvae had the shortest survival period.
Studies on consumption of different instars of tobacco budworm by different instars of the predator indicated that the first instar was most vulnerable to attack by each of the first and third instars of the predator.
Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of cold storage (4.4(DEGREES)C) of eggs and pupal cocoons for different periods of time. The results indicated that percent egg hatch and survival of emerging larvae were highest when stored for one week. Pupal storage for different periods had no detrimental effect on survival of pupae nor fecundity of emerging adults.
