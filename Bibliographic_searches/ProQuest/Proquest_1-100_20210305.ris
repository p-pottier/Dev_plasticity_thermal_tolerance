T1  - Inhibition of Lysine-Specific Demethylase 5A (KDM5A) for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Therapy
AN  - 2494318065
AB  - Breast cancer is one of the most lethal and least curable female malignancies. In 2018, breast cancer emerged as the fifth deadliest source of cancer associated mortality worldwide and was also the seventh deadliest source of cancer associated mortality in China. In the clinic, breast cancers are classified into different subtypes based on whether the tumor cells express estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) or overexpress human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2). Breast cancers that do not express ER and PR and do not overexpress HER2 are referred to as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is associated with significant mortality because it metastasizes to vital organs, primarily to lung, brain, and bone. TNBC has a poor prognosis and treatment because they are typically aggressive, have an increased risk of recurrence, and cannot be cured with hormone or HER2 targeted therapies in the event that the tumor cells become resilient to chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, it is urgent to discover novel approaches to the treatment of TNBC.Lysine specific demethylase 5A (KDM5A), also known as RBP2 or JARID1A, is a transcriptional repressor that is part of the Jumonji domain containing lysine specific demethylases. As a cancer promoting gene, KDM5A can eliminate di and trimethyl groups from activated H3K4, thus resulting in the inhibition of p27, a cell cycle regulator that inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells. Overexpression of KDM5A is associated with many human tumor classes, including cancers of the prostate, breast, stomach, and lung. KDM5A is also involved in promoting the migration, angiogenesis, and drug resistance of cancers. However, scarce KDM5A antagonists have been discovered and the majority lack specificity for KDM5s and other KDMs. Thus, the identification of powerful and specific KDM5A antagonists for combating breast cancer is an urgently need.Metal complexes possess numerous advantages in biological, therapeutic, and environmental fields due to their distinct characteristics, such as strong physicochemical and photochemical properties, stability at room temperature, high quantum yields, lengthy phosphorescence, and wide Stokes shifts. Metals such as ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, and iridium can form highly stable complexes with defined architectures, while different types of ligand modifications can vary the catalytic properties and structural properties of complexes. For example, a cyclometalated center with six distinct ligands can exhibit more than 30 stereoisomers. We and others have developed metal complexes with inhibitory activities against lysine specific demethylases and other kinds of targets such as LSD1 (KDM1A), JMJD2 (KDM4A), JMJD3 (KDM6B), NEDD8, tumor necrosis factor α converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17/CD156q), Autotoxin, HDACs, CDKs, and Wee1 kinase. Based on literature precedent, we hypothesized that metal complexes with diverse ligand modifications could be potential candidates for designing inhibitors targeting KDM5A. Natural products exhibit a varied set of structural architectures with variable biological effects and comparatively low toxicity. At the same time, computational techniques have established themselves as important contributors to initial compound development and optimization. Our and other groups have discovered natural product/natural product like inhibitors based on structure based virtual screening, such as modulators targeting Menin MLL interaction, tumor necrosis factor α, JAK2, epidermal growth factor receptor, NEDD8, VHL/HIF1α interaction, macrophage migration inhibitory factor 2 (MIF 2), STAT3, Vps34, and TLR1 TLR2 heterodimerization. we hypothesized that it could be also a good strategy to identify of KDM5A inhibitors from natural product/natural product like molecules using computational techniques.In this thesis, to develop effective and specific KDM5A inhibitors and explore the feasibility of inhibition KDM5A for TNBC treatment, a cyclopenta [c] chromen derivative compound 1.1 was firstly identified as the lead compound for inhibiting KDM5A demethylase based on hierarchical in silico screen against KDM5A catalytic and a range of biochemical techniques. Compared with the well known KDM5 inhibitor CPI 455, compound 1.1 showed greater effectiveness against KDM5A and vastly superior specificity f or KDM5A relative to KDM4A as well as other KDM5 members. Moreover, the lead candidate decreased the growth of different breast cancer cell lines that overexpress KDM5A. In terms of mechanism, compound 1.1 increased accumulation of p16 and p27 by reducing demethylation of H3K4me3 mediated by KDM5A, thus inducing arrest of the cell cycle and senescence. So far, compound 1.1 is the first KDM5A antagonist reported that is based on the cyclopenta[c]chromen scaffold, and it might function as a new scaffold for generating further KDM5A inhibitors with good potency and specificity. Furthermore, our work offers a potential antitumor mechanism for KDM5A antagonists and showcases the potential of KDM5A as a pharmacological target for breast cancers that overexpress KDM5A. Secondly, a rhodium based complex 2.1 was discovered as a direct KDM5A antagonist with high potency and selectivity that acted via disrupting the KDM5A tri‐‐/di methylated histone 3 protein protein interaction (PPI) in order to inhibiting KDM5A mediated demethylation in vitro and in cellulo. Complex 2.1 increased H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 accumulation in TNBC cell lines, MDA MB 231 and 4T1, and induced growth arrest at the G1 phase. In addition, complex 2.1 displayed powerful anticancer activity in an in vivo murine model of TNBC, acting presumably through KDM5A and upregulation of p27.Furthermore, complex 2.1 showed lower toxicity versus two clinically used agents, cisplatin, and doxorubicin. As far as we know, complex 2.1 represents the first metalderived KDM5A antagonist described so far. We expect that complex 2.1 may be utilized as a new chemotype for generating future anticancer agents or theranostic probes against KDM5A amplified tumors, such as TNBC. Thirdly, we discovered that complex 2.1 could exhibit synergistic anti cancer effect with doxorubicin at a lower dose but with stronger effect. Since KDM5A is involved in drug resistance, we anticipated that inhibiting KDM5A could increase the anticancer activity of doxorubicin in doxorubicin treated cells, which greatly upregulate KDM5A to enhance drug tolerance. A KDM5A inhibitor would inhibit KDM5A demethylase activity and impede the cell events caused by upregulation KDM5A. Our findings provide a putative anticancer mode of action of KDM5A antagonists and showcase the potential of KDM5A as a pharmacological target for TNBC. In the end, we discussed the current progress, the limitations, and the prospects of this thesis.

T1  - Understanding the Transmission of Vector-Borne Pathogens Across Biological Scales
AN  - 2489772513
AB  - Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) present a considerable global health burden. Among VBDs, the mosquito vector transmits important pathogens that are responsible for causing disease in humans including dengue fever, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile fever, chikungunya fever, and malaria. The lack of approved vaccines and targeted therapeutics leave vector control as the primary method to limit disease incidence. Limited funding, wide-spread insecticide resistance, and a severe lack of knowledge regarding basic vector biology present considerable obstacles to the success of vector control programs. This dissertation investigates fundamental knowledge gaps in molecular host-pathogen interactions (i.e. cellular receptors) and organismal environmental responses (i.e. thermal reaction norms) to infer the spatial dynamics of thermal suitability for transmission events. Insights gained from this dissertation form a broader understanding of factors affecting mosquito-borne pathogen transmission. First, mosquito age and species can influence the thermal reaction norm for mosquito traits involved in the transmission of pathogens such as their biting rates, lifespan, and reproductive output. These differences manifested in differences in the amount of geographic area predicted to be thermally suitable for malaria transmission in South Asia. Second, I found that daily temperature fluctuation did affect mosquito trait thermal performance and that these impacts were not accurately estimated by the computational technique rate summation. This finding indicates that we currently do not have a satisfactory method of translating laboratory experimental measures of performance to real-world conditions, likely impacting predictions of the thermal suitability for pathogen transmission. Lastly, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) entry into host cells is enhanced by exposed phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids in the viral envelope through attachment to host cellular surface PS receptors (PSRs), a process termed ‘apoptotic mimicry.’ CHIKV entry through apoptotic mimicry relies on the presence of PSRs and absence of other known cellular attachment factors such as MXRA8 on the surface of host cells. Apoptotic mimicry could aid in viral establishment and dissemination in the human host and should be further investigated in vivo. These insights will aid in the development of novel strategies to combat the incidence of VBDs and improve the allocation of current resources to move towards disease mitigation and elimination.

T1  - Resilience and Sensitivity to Changing Environments in North American River Otters (<em>Lontra canadensis</em>)
AN  - 2488594143
AB  - The North American river otter is a semiaquatic carnivore that occupies freshwater habitats across most of North America, and is a conservation symbol across most of its range. It is used as an indicator species, a keystone species, an umbrella species, and an example of conservation success. The broad distribution of river otters suggests a broad range of habitat tolerances, but they appear to be highly sensitive to anthropogenic habitat alterations. This apparently conflicting robustness across habitat types and sensitivity to habitat change has baffled researchers for decades. Using morphometric, modeling, and synthetic approaches I explored how otters relate to their environment on a broad scale to gain a better understanding of the conditions to which they are robust, the conditions to which they are sensitive, and the mechanisms by which they adapt to varying environments. Using Maximum Entropy species distribution models I determined that river otter distributions are not strongly affected by climate or macro-environmental variables. Using geometric morphometric methods to examine how cranial shape varies across geographic and ecological space, I determined that morphological variation which may affect feeding and locomotion occurs more intensely at local than broad scales, indicating local morphological adaptation is not strong in this species. Finally, a review of the phylogeography and ecology of river otters and related species indicated that this species evolved from a low-speciation lineage that tends to produce species that can occupy a wide variety of environments without undergoing evolutionary change. Overall I determined that river otters do indeed have a broad ecological niche, and do not respond strongly to climatic or environmental differences or changes across their habitats through altering their distributions or locally adapting. Evidence suggests that river otters may respond strongly to anthropogenic alterations of their habitats because anthropogenically-induced habitat alterations tend to have strong consequences for aquatic food chains, and otters may be more reliant on robust food webs than they are on other aspects of their habitats. These findings have implications for how we think of otter conservation and the conservation of species and ecosystems that are strongly affected by otter presence, as well as what otters indicate about their habitat quality. Additionally, these results may shed light on the ecologies of other mustelid carnivores.In the first chapter of my dissertation I conducted a review of the phylogenetics and biogeography of North and South American river otters to investigate how geography and environmental change have driven river otter evolution in the Americas, and how this informs the ecology of the modern species. I focused first on reviewing the biogeography and evolutionary history of Lontra and Pteronura, and then on the modern ecology, threats, and conservations status of each of the four modern species of Lontra and the single extant species of Pteronura. I chose to review these species because they overlap in geographic and environmental space, and because their shared history provides means for an evolutionarily-grounded examination of relative rarity, specialization, and level of conservation concern. I found that speciation between American otters primarily occurs allopatrically, and there is little functional differentiation in response to allopatric speciation, though they do appear to have the ability to adapt in response to extreme conditions when necessary. Additionally, allopatric speciation primarily occurs in response to changes in waterway connectivity, which is also responsible for changes in population connectivity within the modern species. Most otters have less specific habitat requirements than previously thought, as all species of Lontra persist across a wide variety of climates and semi-aquatic environments, and most of them do so without exhibiting a strong evolutionary response. All American river otters exhibit a strong sensitivity to anthropogenic habitat destruction, though several of them have also shown some ability to coexist with humans. Evidence from this study provides strong indication that this has to do with how human activities near waterways affect food webs, and more generally that on closer examination many habitat components previously thought to be requirements for otters may be better interpreted as indicators of food availability.In the second chapter of my dissertation I use species distribution modeling to examine river otter associations with climate and environment across their range to explore their apparently conflicting robustness to habitat change and sensitivity to human presence. Specifically, I examined the climate and landcover variables that constrain the geographic distribution of otters. I obtained otter occurrences from GBIF and BISON biodiversity databases, climate variables from BIOCLIM, and environmental layers from NASA’s SEDAC program. I built Maximum Entropy species distribution models at 80 and 150 km spatial thinning and varying numbers of background points. The combined model at 80 km spatial thinning and default number of background points produced the highest quality models. Six climatic and landcover variables explained over 10% of otter distributions each: open shrubland, net primary productivity, urban/built, water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter. Of these variables I determined that water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter likely have biological significance. However, the predicted range map generated by these models do not match river otter distributions generated by the IUCN and NatureServe. This is likely due to incomplete occurrence data because of low reporting in parts of the species range. I conclude based on these data that river otters have broad climatic and habitat tolerances (as there are six weakly predictive variables as opposed to 1–2 strongly controlling variables) and that local habitat factors, such as intact-ness of riverine food webs, may have greater impact on otter distributions than broad regional variables. Additionally, I call for improved monitoring and reporting of this and other broadly-distributed species to ensure we can adequately track their habitat requirements and conservation status.In the third chapter of my dissertation I use geometric morphometrics to explore the role of cranial morphological variation in otter persistence across the array of otter habitats. I address two research questions: 1. Is there morphological variation and structure in river otters across subspecies? 2. Is morphological variation in river otters best explained by a pattern of isolation by distance or isolation by ecology? I obtained 100 river otter crania from across the species range from museums. I 3-D scanned them using a Geomagic 3-D scanner and landmarked them using the IDAV Landmark program. To answer Q1 I conducted discriminant function analyses Procrustes ANOVAs and a Principal Components Analysis. None of these tests revealed strong morphological patterning, indicating there is not morphological differentiation across subspecies in cranial shape. T address Q2 I conducted Mantel tests and a Multiple Matrix Regression with Randomization (MMRR) on the relationship between morphological distance and geographic, climatic, and environmental distance. Both the Mantel test and the MMRR results indicated no significant relationship between morphological distance and climatic or environmental distance in otter crania. Both indicated a weak but negative relationship between morphological distance and geographic distance, indicating morphological variation is greater at short geographic distances and lower at broad geographic distances. I conclude that there is significant cranial variation between individuals, but little definable structure in this variation. The weak but significant (and potentially complex) relationship between geographic and morphological distance indicates the possibility that diversifying selection across smaller spatial scales may be more important than differentiation across broader populations, possibly indicating individual specialization within a generalist population.

T1  - Prediction of Bubble and Cavity Nucleation in High Damage Rate Irradiation of Simulated Fe-Cr Alloys Using a Hybrid Cluster Dynamics Model
AN  - 2480361048
AB  - A new generation of safer, more efficient nuclear reactors is perhaps the most viable way to combat climate change by weening the power grid from carbon-laden fossil fuels.  However, many of these advanced designs require high temperatures, corrosive environments, and large irradiation doses which degrade structural components.  Development of radiation-tolerant materials is crucial, but conventionally requires long, expensive test reactor irradiations which activate the sample, making examination difficult and costly as well.  Ion irradiation experiments present an extremely appealing alternative, as they can introduce decades of radiation damage in a matter of days with minimal activation.  Unfortunately, these accelerated testing techniques come with a cost of several experimental artefacts which must be accounted for, the most fundamental of which is that damage rate itself has a tremendous impact on its accumulation.  Material degradation on an engineering scale is the result of an extraordinary number of individual atomic-scale picosecond damage events generating defects that migrate, coalesce, and dissociate in just nanoseconds continuously over decades of reactor operation.  Clever kinetic models that bridge this massive gap in length and time scales are necessary to gain physical insight into radiation damage which will aid in the development of candidate materials designed on a microscopic scale to minimize defect accumulation. This gap is particularly pronounced for the slow, but often life-limiting phenomenon of swelling, where vacant lattice sites eventually accumulate into sizable cavities which uniformly increase the volume of a component beyond its tolerance.  
The objective of this work is to use cluster dynamics modeling to better understand the temperature, helium generation, and dose rate dependencies of swelling behavior in simulated Ferritic-Martensitic (FM) steels.  An initial study using a conventional modeling approach based on reaction rate theory was fundamentally incapable of reproducing several key experimental swelling observations, but most of these were recovered by iteratively adding novel physical mechanisms.  Foremost among these discrepancies was an overprediction of swelling rates, a complete lack of incubation periods, and an almost negligible effect of co-generated helium.  Introducing a bias toward interstitials to cavities informed by molecular statics calculations, presented a new barrier to cavity nucleation that could only be overcome through the accumulation of stabilizing helium.  Since FM steels have low transmutation rates, helium generation rates are relatively low, resulting in long incubation periods and low swelling rates.  Second, the temperature shift—an offset in optimal swelling temperature between high and low dose rate conditions—was overpredicted.  A heterogeneous nucleation mechanism, promoting helium self-clustering, weakened dose rate dependence by disproportionately facilitating cavity nucleation at low dose rate, decreasing temperature shift.  Finally, observations of swelling without helium were rationalized with bias suppression catalyzed by segregation of chemical impurities to the cavity surface.  
These mechanisms ultimately combine to constitute a more complete, nuanced understanding of cavity nucleation as a function of temperature, dose rate, and helium generation rate.  This creates a more complete account of how microstructures evolve under irradiation and strengthens the predictive link between accelerated ion irradiation experiments and the reactor conditions they seek to emulate.  Therefore, in addition to contributions to the fundamental science of irradiation damage, this model could inform the design of future experiments to optimize their investigative potential, hastening the qualification of candidate materials.

T1  - The Role of the Recently Deorphanized G-Protein Coupled Receptor, GPR171, in Morphine Tolerance and Withdrawal
AN  - 2477241577
AB  - Opioid analgesics, such as morphine, represent the gold standard pain killer and the most frequently used drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Despite being a potent analgesic, morphine has unwanted and dangerous side effects with repeated use, such as tolerance and withdrawal. Tolerance is a state when a person no longer responds to a drug and a higher dose is required to achieve the same initial pain relief. Withdrawal is a set of undesirable psychological and physiological symptoms that occur after someone stops taking a drug or reduces the dose. Morphine tolerance and withdrawal play a vital role in the development of opioid addiction. One of the crucial goals to reduce opioid addiction is to develop pain therapeutics for chronic pain with high efficacy and reduced side effects. Despite centuries of extensive research, the existing treatments for chronic pain have met with limited success and developing better and alternative therapies are urgently needed. A novel G-protein coupled receptor, GPR171, is found to be highly expressed throughout the pain modulating regions of the brain. Our previous study found that activating this receptor with an agonist, enhances morphine’s pain relieving property in combination therapy during acute treatment in mice. In this study, we investigated the effects of activating this receptor during long-term morphine treatment to evaluate tolerance and withdrawal. Our results demonstrate that, activating this receptor reduces morphine induced tolerance in female mice (but not males) on a thermal pain test and it does not have any additional adverse effects on morphine tolerance and withdrawal syndrome. These results suggest the potentiality of GPR171 as a novel pain therapeutics in combination with morphine with enhanced efficacy and reduced tolerance and dependence for the treatment of chronic pain, especially for females.

AB  - Climate change, affordable and clean energy, and responsible consumption and production are some of the important goals to be achieved for sustainable development. The current technologies used to address these challenges are energy and resource intensive. Furthermore, there are various limitations related to cost, storage, scalability and safety.Adsorbent materials are seen as a promising alternative remediation system due to their low energy consumption and minimal chemical waste production. However, most of the traditional adsorbents, such as activated carbon and zeolites lack the structural tunability to have long-term effectiveness and their use is limited. As discussed in Chapter 1, metal organic-frameworks (MOFs) are a class of advanced porous materials which have been successful in a variety of applications due to their high degree of structural tunability, diverse range of structures and excellent designability. This work focuses on their use in cabon capture and conversion, methane storage and sustainable catalysis.Chapter 2 explores the mitigation of CO2 and its subsequent utilization to synthesize value added chemicals. The first partially interpenetrated metal-organic framework with nbo topology is obtained that exhibited selective adsorption of CO2 over CH4. Due to presence of high density of catalytically active sites, it additionally shows excellent catalytic efficacy for the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with epoxides to produce industrially important cyclic carbonates in more than 90% yields using solvent-free conditions.Chapter 3 details the work to employ stable soc-MOFs based on iron and aluminum for on-board methane storage under DOE operational conditions. Emerging as an outperformed class of MOFs, square-octahedron (soc) topology MOFs (soc-MOFs) feature superior properties of high porosity, large gas storage capacity, and excellent thermal/chemical stability. Iron and aluminum based soc-MOFs possessing a very high Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface areas and large pore volumes are obtained. Furthermore, the MOFs exhibit high thermal and aqueous stability. The iron MOF demonstrates by far the highest gravimetric uptake of 369 cm3 (STP)/g under the DOE operational storage conditions (35 bar and 298 K) and a high volumetric deliverable capacity of 192 cc/cc at 298 K and 65 bar. These results in totality promote ANG technology and make these frameworks promising candidates for on-board methane storage.Chapter 4 concentrates on use of discrete bifunctional nanoball metal organic cuboctahedra for one-pot tandem catalysis. The co-existence of Lewis base pyridine group and Lewis acid copper site render the MOP efficient catalytic activity for the one-pot deacetalization Knoevenagel reaction of benzaldehyde diacetal and malononitrile. The target product is obtained in excellent yield using DMSO as the solvent. The catalyst is also easily separated using centrifugation and can be recovered in good yield. The good catalytic activity and recyclability without significant loss in catalytic activity during the cycling experiments are additional advantages. This also opens a new platform into utilizing these nanoball architectures for catalysis.Chapter 5 utilizes an indium-based MOF as a highly efficient catalyst for one-pot, solvent free multicomponent catalysis. The MOF has the robust soc-topology and dispalys the highest BET surface area among reported indium MOFs. It acts as a heterogeneous Lewis acid-base catalyst for highly efficient conversion in one-pot multicomponent Strecker reaction of ketones in solvent-free conditions. Moreover, the heterogeneous catalyst is easy to separate and shows negligible loss of activity for over four cycles. The In-pbpta thus provides a sustainable and efficient catalytic platform for the Strecker synthesis of -aminonitriles which can be further hydrolyzed to give the unnatural -amino acids. This work overall demonstrates the successfull use of multifunctional MOFs for applications in sustainability.Through optimization of the design of the material based on well defined topologies, and functionalization for the desired application, a high activity is observed leading to energy and process efficiency. Through further optimization of the design, these approaches can not only ensure a progress towards sustainable development and processes, but also advance MOFs for their commercial large-scale usage.

T1  - Nanoplastic and Nanomaterials in Terrestrial Systems: Environmental Concerns and Challenges
AN  - 2466761401
AB  - Micro- and nanomaterials have always been a part of earth’s biogeochemical cycles. Only within the last century has production of anthropogenic materials in the micro- to nanometer size range become a significant input to earth’s ecosystems. Over the last few decades, much research has been done to characterize how specific micro- and nanomaterials interact with a variety of ecosystems. One source of engineered micro- and nanomaterials to terrestrial environments is the application of biosolids to the soil as fertilizer. Unplanned addition of engineered materials to the soil may have negative environmental consequences, or could hinder the further use of biosolids as a beneficial soil amendment. The overall goal of this dissertation is to assess the potential for micro- and nanoplastic, as well as silver nanoparticles, to accumulate in dryland agricultural soils with 20+ years of biosolids application for fertilizer. We also seek to understand the interaction of these man-made materials with the ecosystem, and develop better methods for their identification and characterization in soil. The results indicate that micro- and nanometer-sized plastic particles accumulate on the surface of Arabidopsis and wheat roots, especially root caps, but no evidence for movement of nanoplastic into the root tissue was found. It is also shown that silver, in Ag2S nanoparticulate form, has accumulated to concentrations of 1.5 mg silver kg−1 soil after 20+ years of biosolids application. Ecotoxicological effects of Ag2S nanoparticles at that concentration in soil are unknown based on current literature. Finally, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) was unable to detect concentrations of five environmentally relevant plastics in biosolids amended soils, but plastics were detected in biosolids. The detection limit for this method were determined to be 0.05 wt. % for polystyrene, and limit of quantification was 0.2 wt. % at the 0.95 confidence level. Alternative extraction, identification, and quantification techniques were also tested and reviewed. The results, taken together, highlight the need for further development of methods to assess the potential environmental risks posed by the addition of biosolids with associated silver and plastic nano- and microparticles to terrestrial ecosystems.

T1  - The Effects of Warming and Hypoxia as Individual and Combined Stressors on the Survival, Physiology, and Development of Early Life Stage Chinook Salmon
AN  - 2458107806
AB  - Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations in the Central Valley of California are the most vulnerable to climate variability within the species (Crozier et al., 2019). Major threats include climate change, habitat loss, and water management infrastructure. Early life stages of salmon are particularly susceptible to stressors related to these threats because they have little to no ability to swim away from sub-optimal conditions within the incubation environment. Instead, they must rely on internal physiological responses to cope with stressors. Developing salmon thrive in cool, well-oxygenated water; however, warming and hypoxia (low dissolved oxygen) are two stressors that are prevalent within the gravel redds. Few studies have examined the effects of multiple, co-occurring stressors on salmon embryos, but warming and hypoxia are likely to interact because of opposing effects on metabolic rate and physiological performance. The interaction between warming and hypoxia may have contributed to recent high embryo mortality in an endangered population of Sacramento River salmon, where low flows and resulting hypoxia are hypothesized to have reduced the thermal tolerance of salmon embryos (Martin et al. 2017). In this dissertation I examined the effects of warming and hypoxia on the survival and physiology of early life stage Chinook salmon in laboratory and field studies. Rearing embryos under chronic hypoxia resulted in higher mortality, especially in combination with warming, and affected upper thermal tolerance and hypoxia tolerance (Chapter 2). In Chapter 3, I investigated how the timing of exposure to warming, hypoxia, or both stressors affected early life stages during the exposure and found that exposure to both stressors had the greatest effect on hatching, growth, and metabolic rate if embryos were chronically exposed to these stressors during their entire embryogenesis or if they were only exposed late in embryogenesis, shortly before hatch. Furthermore, salmon developmental rate, metabolic rate, and acute stress tolerance continued to be affected in the alevin and fry even though they were transferred to control conditions following hatch, suggesting there are lasting effects of early stress exposure on the physiological performance of juvenile salmon. In Chapter 4, I conducted a field experiment to study how natural water quality variables, with a focus on dissolved oxygen and temperature, affected salmon embryo hatching and survival within artificial redds on the American River near Sacramento, California. Overall, hatching success was low, in part because of poor egg quality. Intergravel dissolved oxygen was highly variable and contributed to differences in embryo survival among the redds, along with intergravel temperature and water flow above the redds. Overall, these studies indicate that the interactions between temperature and dissolved oxygen affect key aspects of early salmon development and physiology in different ways than the individual stressors. My dissertation should help to inform management strategies to improve early life stage salmon survival in Central Valley rivers such as dam management plans for river flows that consider dissolved oxygen and water temperature for salmon.

T1  - Thermoresponsive Nanocapsules with Suitable Mechanical Properties for Skin Hydration
TT  - Thermoresponsive Nanokapseln mit geeigneten mechanischen Eigenschaften für die Hidrierung der Haut
AN  - 2457238532
AB  - The skin is the largest organ of the human body. It fulfills various functions, such as preventing the loss of salts and fluids as well as regulates the body temperature. In addition, the skin acts as a highly complex and effective biological barrier, hindering the penetration of harmful substances (feature mostly attributed to the stratum corneum; SC). Overcoming the SC represents a great challenge in dermal and transdermal therapies, leading to the development of multiple strategies to enable the permeation of therapeutics across the skin. Using penetration enhancers (chemical or physical) has proven to increase the penetration of therapeutics. Nevertheless, the use of penetration enhancers exposes a great risk, as they can lead to permanent damage on the skin, reducing its barrier efficiency and resulting in the intrusion of harmful substances, which can result in inflammation. Nanoparticle based dermal and transdermal drug delivery approaches represent promising tools to deliver drugs to the target site, while reducing or eliminating side effects. It has been found that soft nanoparticles can induce skin hydration and subsequently deliver therapeutics into the skin. Due to their high surface area, tunable sizes, easy functionalization (in situ or post-synthetic) and large encapsulation capacities, nanocapsules (NCs) represent a promising strategy for topical drug delivery. NCs are generally defined as hollow nanoparticles composed of a cross-linked shell surrounding a core forming space. Herein, we aim to synthesize soft thermoresponsive nanocapsules (tNCs) to induce skin hydration, thus enabling the skin penetration of high molecular compounds. For this purpose, NCs with a thermoresponsive shell and a void of 100 nm diameter, were synthesized. These NCs can shrink or swell upon a thermal trigger, which can be used to induce the release of water and or other encapsulated molecules in a controlled fashion. The tNCs were built using silica nanoparticles as sacrificial templates (to ensure the reproducibility or their core) in a seeded precipitation polymerization. Different ratios of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide) (PNIPMAM) were employed as thermoresponsive polymers and either N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS) as cross-linker or dendritic polyglycerol (dPG) as macrocross-linker were utilized to build the tNCs’ shell. Firstly, the effect of the synthesis on the mechanical properties of the tNCs was investigated. For this purpose, a comprehensive study was performed to investigate the mechanical properties of well-known (PNIPAM-BIS) thermoresponsive nanoparticles. In the study, nanogels, nanogels with a hard core and nanocapsules were investigated below and above the volume phase transition temperature (temperature at which the particles change from a swollen state to a collapsed state) (VPTT) using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), cryogenic-electron microscopy/electron tomography, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in liquid. It could be shown, that the different structure of the particles affects their thermoresponsive behavior. Moreover, outstanding thermomechanical changes were found for the NCs (Young modulus changes from kPa to GPa upon crossing the VPTT). These findings underline the importance of fully characterizing the particles as their thermomechanical properties could enhance or limit their further applications. Additionally, these results were used to rationally design novel tNCs to induce skin hydration using dPG to introduce non-thermoresponsive domains within the shell; thus, leading to flexible materials even above the VPTT. By varying the ratio between PNIPAM and PNIPMAM, the VPTT, as well as the shell density, could be controlled. Next, the interactions and effects of tNCs on the stratum corneum were investigated using fluorescence microscopy, high resolution microscopy, and stimulated Raman spectromicroscopy. It could be shown, that the thermoresponsive properties of the tNCs could increase skin hydration. Finally, the potential of the NCs as penetration enhancer was assessed by using Atto Oxa12 NHS ester (a high molecular weight dye) as a model drug. It could be demonstrated, that the NCs increased the penetration of Atto Oxa12 in comparison to an aqueous formulation and a solution of the dye in 30% DMSO. This thesis demonstrates that both material properties and core-nanoarchitecture can considerably affect the thermomechanical properties of soft nanoparticles. In addition, it could be proven that the dPG-based tNCs cause skin hydration and that their thermoresponsive features can further enhance the hydration of the skin. Moreover, this work underlines the outstanding potential of tNCs to act as penetration enhancers for high molecular weight compounds by inducing skin hydration.Alternate abstract:Die Haut ist das größte Organ des menschlichen Körpers. Sie erfüllt verschiedene Funktionen, z. B. die Verhinderung des Verlusts von Salzen und Flüssigkeiten sowie die Regulierung der Körpertemperatur. Darüber hinaus wirkt die Haut als hochkomplexe und wirksame biologische Barriere, die das Eindringen von Schadstoffen verhindert (ein Merkmal, das hauptsächlich dem Stratum Corneum zugeschrieben wird; SC). Die Überwindung des SC stellt eine große Herausforderung für dermale und transdermale Therapien dar und führte zur Entwicklung mehrerer Strategien, um das Eindringen von Therapeutika in die Haut zu ermöglichen. Um die Penetration von Therapeutika zu verbessern, werden sogenannte penetrationsverstärker (chemisch oder physikalisch) eingesetzt. Ihre Verwendung stellt jedoch ein großes Risiko dar, da sie permanente Schäden an der Haut erzeugen können. Außerdem kann durch die Verwendung von Penetrationsverstärkern die Barriereeffizienz der Haut verringert werden und dadurch das Eindringen von Schadstoffen ermöglichen, die zu Entzündungen führen können. Auf Nanopartikeln basierende dermale und transdermale Wirkstofftransporter stellen vielversprechende Werkzeuge dar, um Arzneimittel an die Zielstelle zu transportieren und dadurch Nebenwirkungen zu reduzieren oder zu eliminieren. Es wurde festgestellt, dass weiche Nanopartikel die Haut hydrieren und dadurch den Transport von Therapeutika in die Haut ermöglichen können. Nanokapseln (NCs) sind aufgrund ihrer großen Oberfläche, einstellbaren Größen, einfachen Funktionalisierung (in situ oder postsynthetisch) und großen Verkapselungskapazitäten eine vielversprechende Strategie für den topischen Wirkstofftransport. Nanokapseln werden im Allgemeinen als hohle Nanopartikel definiert, die aus einer vernetzten Hülle bestehen, die einen Kernbildungsraum umgibt. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wollen wir weiche thermoresponsive Nanokapseln (tNCs) synthetisieren, um die Haut zu hydrieren und so das Eindringen hochmolekularer Verbindungen in die Haut zu ermöglichen. Zu diesem Zweck wurden NCs mit einer thermoresponsiven Hülle und einem Hohlraum von etwa 100 nm Durchmesser synthetisiert. Diese NCs können nach einem thermischen Stimulus schrumpfen oder anschwellen, wodurch die Freisetzung von Wasser und anderen eingekapselten Molekülen auf kontrollierte Weise induziert werden kann. Die tNCs wurden unter Verwendung von Silika-Nanopartikeln als Opfertemplat (um die Reproduzierbarkeit des Kerns zu gewährleisten) in einer angeimpften Fällungspolymerisation hergestellt. Verschiedene Verhältnisse von Poly (N-isopropylacrylamid) (PNIPAM) und Poly (Nisopropylmethacrylamid) (PNIPMAM) wurden als thermoresponsive Polymere verwendet und N,N'-Methylenbisacrylamid (BIS) oder dendritisches Polyglycerol (dPG) wurden als Vernetzer bzw. als Makrovernetzer verwendet, um die Schale der tNCs zu aufzubauen. Zunächst wurde der Einfluss einiger Syntheseparameter auf die mechanischen Eigenschaften der tNCs untersucht. Zu diesem Zweck wurde eine umfassende Studie durchgeführt, um die mechanischen Eigenschaften bekannter (PNIPAM-BIS) thermoresponsiver Nanopartikel zu analysieren. Nanogele, Nanogele mit einem harten Kern und tNCs wurden unterhalb und oberhalb der Volumen-Phasenübergangs-Temperatur (Temperatur, bei der die Partikel von einem gequollenen Zustand in einen kollabierten Zustand übergehen) (VPTT) mithilfe von Nanopartikel-Tracking-Analyse (NTA), Kryoelektronenmikroskopie/Elektronentomographie und Rasterkraftmikroskopie (AFM) in Lösung untersucht. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die unterschiedlichen Architekturen das thermoresponsive Verhalten der Partikel beeinflusst. Darüber hinaus wurden herausragende thermomechanische Änderungen für die NCs gefunden (Young-Modul-Änderungen von kPa zu GPa beim Überqueren der VPTT). Diese Ergebnisse unterstreichen die Bedeutung einer vollständigen Charakterisierung der Partikel, da ihre thermomechanischen Eigenschaften ihre weiteren Anwendungen verbessern oder einschränken könnten. Zusätzlich wurden diese Ergebnisse verwendet, um neuartige tNCs zu entwerfen, um die Haut zu hydrieren. Dafür wurde dPG eingesetzt, um nichtthermoresponsive Bereiche innerhalb der Schale einzuführen, wodurch die Synthese von flexiblen Partikeln auch oberhalb der VPTT möglich werden sollte. Durch Variation des Verhältnisses zwischen PNIPAM und PNIPMAM konnten die VPTTs sowie die Vernetzungsdichte der Schalen gesteuert werden. Als nächstes wurden die Wechselwirkungen und Wirkungen von tNCs auf das SC unter Verwendung von Fluoreszenzmikroskopie, hochauflösender Mikroskopie und stimulierter Raman- Spektromikroskopie untersucht. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die thermoresponsiven Eigenschaften der tNCs die Hydrierung der Haut erhöhen können. Schließlich wurde das Potenzial der tNCs als Penetrationsverstärker unter Verwendung von Atto Oxa12 NHS-Ester (einem Farbstoff mit hohem Molekulargewicht) als Modellwirkstoff bewertet. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die tNCs die Penetration von Atto Oxa12 im Vergleich zu einer wässrigen Formulierung und einer Lösung des reinen Farbstoffs in 30% DMSO erhöhten. Diese Arbeit zeigt, dass sowohl die Materialeigenschaften als auch die Nanoarchitektur des Kerns die thermomechanischen Eigenschaften weicher Nanopartikel erheblich beeinflussen können. Darüber hinaus konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass die auf dPG basierenden tNCs die Haut hydrieren können und dass ihre thermoresponsiven Eigenschaften die Feuchtigkeitsversorgung der Haut weiter verbessern können. Darüber hinaus unterstreicht diese Arbeit das herausragende Potenzial von tNCs, als Penetrationsverstärker für Verbindungen mit hohem Molekulargewicht zu wirken.

T1  - Thermal Niche Requirements of the White-Spotted Bamboo Shark <em>Chiloscyllium plagiosum</em>
AN  - 2447575627
AB  - The Whitespotted bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium plagiosum is a species of longtail carpet shark native to the Indo-Pacific region known as the Coral Triangle. Temperatures across much of the geographic range of the Whitespotted bamboo shark are rising and it is not immediately clear if the species has the physiological capacity to withstand the impending rise in sea surface temperatures expected by the end of the century. Although listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Near Threatened in 2006, their current conservation status is unknown. Indeed, thermal requirements of elasmobranch fishes in general are grossly understudied with empirical data available for only five of the more than 1200 extant elasmobranch species. The purpose of this study was to quantify thermal niche requirements of the Whitespotted bamboo shark by estimating key thermal metrics including intrinsic tolerance, upper and lower critical temperatures, thermal acclimation range, and upper and lower temperature acclimation responses. The results are interpreted and discussed in relation to current and potential future thermal conditions across the shark’s traditional geographic range. The bamboo shark data presented here are the first to describe thermal requirements in a selachian elasmobranch.

T1  - Thermal Tolerance Determination of the Red-eared Slider, <em>Trachemys scripta elegans</em>
AN  - 2447559741
AB  - Red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) are considered one of the most abundant and successful invasive turtle species in the world. Currently, red-eared sliders are known to have reproducing populations on every continent with the exception of Antarctica. In areas where they have become established, red-eared sliders often outcompete, and in some areas extirpate native turtle fauna. A key adaptation recognized in red-eared sliders is their ability to survive a wide range of environmental temperatures. Across their native range, the turtles are noted to survive long-term winter freezing temperatures, as well as prolonged exposure to summer temperature extremes. Although temperature plays an important role in shaping red-eared slider ecology and distribution, relatively little is known about their thermal requirements. This study is the first to use Critical and Chronic Thermal Methodology to define the red-eared slider’s thermal niche. The chronic maximum temperature was 43°C ± 0.3, while the chronic minimum was 18°C ± 0.3. Critical Thermal Maximum increased in correlation to acclimation temperature, 41.8°C ± 0.3 at 15°C, 43.2°C ± 0.3 at 22°C, 44.1°C ± 0.5 at 28°C, and 45.7°C ± 0.2 when acclimated to 35°C. Critical Thermal Minimum also increased in relation to the acclimation temperature, -0.04°C ± 0.3 at 15°C, 2.7°C ± 0.1 at 22°C, 3.3°C ± 0.3 at 28°C, and 5.1°C ± 0.2 when acclimated at 35°C. Using the results of this study, the thermal polygon of red-eared sliders was able to be quantified and paves the way for future thermal studies in this species.

T1  - Utilizing Dendrochronology to Investigate Multiscale Drivers of Conifer Growth in the Pacific Northwest
AN  - 2447247405
AB  - Conifers dominate temperate and boreal forests around the world and many species are economically important for structural timber production. They are also adapted to extreme climatatic conditions, such as drought and cold temperatures. Numerous conifer species occur within the Pacific Northwest United States (PNW) including firs, hemlocks, cedars, larches, and pines. The diversity of hydrologic and geographic variables across the PNW creates distinctive localized climates with differing limiting factors on conifer growth, such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability. Dendrochronology, or tree-ring dating, is a multidisciplinary methodology that utilizes annual tree ring widths to investigate environmental conditions influencing trees or stands throughout their life. A substantial amount of information is known about tree-growth responses to climate and stand dynamics. However, investigations into interacting silvicultural and climatological influences, as well as spatial variability of growth relationships, may inform future management and dendrochronological techniques. The first three chapters of this dissertation utilize dendrochronology to investigate multiple drivers of species-specific tree growth. 
The first chapter investigates the impacts of density reductions, via different thinning intensities, on tree growth in moist mixed coniferous forests in northern Idaho, USA. Species that respond rapidly to available sunlight and/or nutrients, like western larch and western redcedar, show the greatest growth increases following thinning. The less consistent responses to thinning by western hemlock and grand fir were likely due to their autecological characteristics and inherent lack of responses to greater growing space. Findings from Chapter 1 align with past thinning experiments and found that thinning is an effective tool for increasing growth in most species. However, if the objectives are to favor injury-prone and less competitive species like western hemlock and grand fir, precautions must be taken during and after treatment to limit tree damage that could produce undesired responses. 
Chapter 2 presents the temporal variability of growth-drought relationships for the same species from Chapter 1, and how that relationship is influenced by thinning. The four species in this study, western larch, grand fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock, show a wide range of responses to drought depending on timing of drought, length of drought, intensity of drought, and forest stand density. Findings indicate that length and season of drought, species-specific drought tolerance, and stage of stand development, influence growth-drought responses. Drought sensitivity often involves trade-offs among other limiting factors like direct competition for resources. Moreover, trees growing in moist forests may not be as highly susceptible to droughts as those in dry forests. Therefore, it is suggested that stands be managed as complex adaptive systems by prioritizing  species, age, and structural diversity. Results from Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 demonstrate that strip clearcutting in moist forest results in diverse conifer species composition and structure that can be further managed to create complexity through mid-rotation thinning. 
Chapter 3 focused at a larger spatial scale (e.g., greater PNW) to examine the effects of geographical factors on flow-growth relationships of four different conifer species. Streamflow correlated negatively with subalpine fir and mountain hemlock growth, species commonly found at cool, moist, high elevation sites, indicating that they are likely more sensitive to severe environmental variation like those experienced with climate change. Drier-site species, Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine were mostly positively correlated with flow, though a few had significant negative correlations, indicating that they are species with high adaptive capacity. Results help simplify planning for field collections and strengthen methodologies for future streamflow reconstructions by supplying knowledge about which streams, species, elevations, and directions will yield the most robust models in the spatially diverse terrain of the PNW. 
Chapter 4 is a collaborative synthesis of climate change research in the Columbia River Basin (CRB). Results show that spatial distribution and thematic content of research varies across an international border, with greater concentrations of research in the United States than Canada. A general scarcity of social science research and limited interaction between social and biophysical content reinforces the need for increased collaboration between disparate disciplines. Future research focus areas should include research related to climate change adaptation and mitigation, increased integration between social and biophysical sciences, and collaborations that bridge the international border for a more unified basin-wide focus. Focusing on these new directions for research will increase the potential for science and management communities to co-produce actionable science and effective responses to climate change. 
With the utilization of dendrochronological techniques, many of the interacting drivers of species-specific tree growth in the PNW were discovered. Shade tolerance, disturbance dynamics, and hydroclimate all influence conifer growth in the region. The relationships between streamflow and growth are heightened for trees growing in extreme climates, and these relationships are driven by geographical features. Overall, this dissertation provides insight into dendrochronological techniques as well as silvicultural management in moist mixed conifer forests; it also lends support that forest management can assist tree growth and alter growth-drought relationships depending on species. Finally, the dissertation offers additional evidence to the decades-long theory that trees growing at the edges of their ranges show higher sensitivity to limiting factors.

T1  - Nest Microclimate Manipulation Affects Growth, Development, and Heat-Shock Protein Production in the Eastern Bluebird <em>(Sialia sialis</em>)
AN  - 2444820315
AB  - Climatic conditions are particularly important to breeding birds, especially as recent global change has caused a shift in the timing and length of avian breeding seasons. Nest microclimate has been shown to influence avian development and parental care, however, little work has been done to examine whether increased heat poses a cost to altricial nestlings at different stages of their development. We manipulated the temperature of eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) nest boxes to examine whether or not nestlings exhibit a heat shock response, and a difference in growth or altered parasite loads at both their early and late developmental stages. We found that heated birds were in poorer body condition over the course of the treatment and gained less mass (i.e. had a decreased growth rate) in their early development relative to control birds. Overall, heat-shock protein expression did not differ between treatments, but it was upregulated with age within heated birds, suggesting that a protective response was mounted as the birds became more developed. Feather-degrading bacterial load of thirteen-day old nestlings was highly variable and unrelated to the growth and body condition of the birds, suggesting that proliferation is influenced by ambient conditions, not individual susceptibility to parasites. Overall, our findings reveal a cost posed by excessive heat as well as a signature of tolerance, expressed when the birds are more developed and nearer to fledging. Together with other literature on cavity-nesters, this study better informs our understanding of how vertebrate animals can respond plastically to unfavorable conditions in their rearing environment and highlights the need for additional examination of behavior as a mediator of development and physiology.

T1  - The Physiological and Life-History Costs of Parasitism: Effect of the Interaction Between Temperature and the Ectoparasite <em>Varroa destructor</em> on <em>Apis mellifera</em>
AN  - 2442849730
AB  - I hypothesized that bees maintained at higher acclimation temperatures would be more sensitive to Varroa infestation and exhibit more pronounced detrimental effects on their physiological variables caused by this ectoparasite than their counterparts maintained at less stressful temperatures. We also tested whether and by how much the total number of cells and the total protein amount in hemolymph as the survival rate in individual honeybees is affected by the number of mites and acclimation temperature. Thus, the aim of this research was to determine the impact and interaction between different parasitic loads of Varroa and acclimation temperature on some physiological functions on adult honeybee workers. I study adult bees because the evidence of detrimental effects of mites in this life stage remains limited and ambiguous (Nazzi and Le Conte, 2016), even though it has been speculated that the consumption of fat reserves by mites should significantly reduce energy storage and affect the immune response (Ramsey et al., 2019; Robar et al., 2011). The specifics aim were, to quantify the putative impact of thermal history in combination with a variable parasitic load on the energy expenditure, the individual survival rate, the amount of hemolymph cells and the total amount of lymphatic proteins in honeybees where everything else was maintaining equal.

T1  - Climate Change Studies of Southwestern White Pine: Phenotypic and Life History Trait Responses to Temperature Manipulations During Seed Development and Seedling Growth
AN  - 2441550710
AB  - This dissertation is part of a multi-institutional study of southwestern white pine (P. strobiformis) in Mexico and the USA where the species fills important ecological roles. Collectively, our research team seeks to better understand the genetic, ecophysiological, evolutionary, and disease ecology characteristics of the species to provide guidance to forest managers on how best to conserve the species in the face of multiple threats. The chapters that follow describe observational and experimental studies motivated by the need to understand how climate warming may affect two highly vulnerable stages in the early life of P. strobiformis: (1) seed development, and (2) early seedling growth through the fourth growing season. Uniquely, this dissertation investigates effects of elevated temperatures during embryogenesis on early seedling growth. As evidence mounts that heightened radiative forcing will increase the frequency and severity of heatwaves and increase mean air temperatures with particularly strong effects expected over the southwestern region of the USA, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how novel thermal conditions will affect southwestern forests.Chapter one provides background information called upon throughout the remaining chapters. In chapter 2, I introduce and demonstrate the effects of the seed warming method referred to throughout the remaining chapters. The passive seed warming treatment that is central to all chapters of this dissertation was deployed in seed source canopies to elevate the air temperature surrounding seed cones during seed maturation. The method was shown to elevate the air temperature surrounding seed cones by an ecologically realistic average of 2.1°C. Measures of seed, seedling, and seedling mycorrhizal traits from a common garden trial including genetic families from northern Arizona revealed that seed warming significantly increased root tissue allocation when measured eight months after seed warming. The effect size of seed warming on root tissue allocation diminished with time. Multispectral imaging of seedling canopies and seedling mycorrhizal richness revealed a significant effect of seed warming, but with minor effect sizes. Chapter three partitioned sources of variation of ecologically important seed traits. Variation in seed mass was best explained by growing degree days >5°C in the spring and summer, emergence phenology was best explained by springtime relative humidity and precipitation, and seed mass varied with a significant interaction between seed source tree and the seed warming treatment. We infer from this study that responses of seed traits to warmer temperatures may hinder regeneration of some P. strobiformis populations. Chapter four investigated early seedling growth and survival, water relations, and photosystem physiology as it related to oxidative stress exposure imposed by drought and the herbicide paraquat in relation to the seed warming treatment and growth in three growth chamber temperature regimes during the first four months of growth. When controlling for both the temperature of the growing environment and the seed warming treatment, morphological seedling traits were found to respond strongly to the temperature regime in which they were grown, but not to seed warming. Specifically, seedlings grown in chambers held at cooler temperatures showed increased root:shoot mass and diameter at root collar. Conversely, seedlings grown in warm growth chambers exhibited increased oxidative stress resistance as measured by PSII chlorophyll fluorescence following alternating rounds of exposure to the herbicide paraquat and direct sunlight. These findings illustrate the various ways by which P. strobiformis may respond to heat exposure, and they suggest that the species may have limited potential to adjust morphologically to heat through maternal effects and early exposure to elevated temperatures. Increased oxidative stress resistance achieved by early heat exposure may, however, be an important mechanism by which seedlings may develop tolerance to short-lived heat waves during the vulnerable early seedling stage as climate change proceeds. In chapter five, we studied mortality trends and seedling traits related to mortality across a cold, warm, and hot common garden to determine whether pine seedlings from warmer seed source regions were more tolerant of warm and dry growing conditions than seedlings from cooler seed source regions. We also sought to determine whether experimental warming during seed development influenced subsequent seedling survival under hotter and drier conditions. Seedlings from the coldest seed source region exhibited the lowest cumulative mortality across cold, warm, and hot common gardens. We found that the largest difference among seed source regions in seasonal mortality was due to a high proportion of winter-related mortality exhibited by seedlings from the warmest seed source region in both the hot and cold gardens. Seed warming during development was related to significantly higher summer-related mortality at the hot garden, suggesting that seeds developing under warmer future temperatures may not be better prepared for subsequent survival in warmer growth environments. Both winter- and summer-related mortality were highest for seedlings in the hot garden, and seedlings under drought at the hot garden during the second summer of drought exhibited the highest percent mortality recorded throughout the three years of observations described here. Seedlings from the warmest seed source region exhibited the greatest vulnerability to growth under warmer temperatures, and seedlings from the cold but not the warm regions exhibited significant within-family variation for vulnerability to growing temperatures. Seedlings that released dormancy too early in the winter were more prone to mortality later that year, but that trend did not vary by region. We conclude that warmer temperatures during seed development may negatively affect seedling survival under a warmer future climate, and that warmer seed sources that are not typically exposed to freezing temperatures may not harbor genotypes better suited to warmer future climates in areas that freeze. Finally, regions that harbor genotypes that exhibit high survival both under cold and warm temperatures may be least vulnerable to climate change-related extirpation.

T1  - Withering Syndrome Disease Dynamics in Wild and Cultured Northeastern Pacific Abalones
AN  - 2440667356
AB  - Withering syndrome (WS) is a chronic bacterial disease of abalones, Haliotis spp., caused by a Rickettsia-like organism (WS-RLO). The etiological agent, Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, occurs along the eastern Pacific margin of North America in California, US and Baja California, Mexico. However, as infected abalones have been transported to Chile, China, Taiwan, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Spain, Thailand, and Japan, the geographic range of the bacterium is likely broad especially where California red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) are cultured or in areas where native species have been exposed to red abalone. Disease susceptibility varies among abalones with up to 99% losses of black abalone (H. cracherodii) in lab and field studies in the US, to no losses among the small abalone (H. diversicolor supertexta) in Thailand. Some abalone populations that have suffered severe WS mortality events have developed resistance to the disease. In addition, a newly identified phage hyperparasite of the WS-RLO may reduce pathogenicity and dampen associated losses. Proper diagnosis of WS requires the identification of infection with the pathogen (WS-RLO detected via in situ hybridization or histology coupled with PCR and sequence analysis) accompanied by morphological changes that characterize this disease (e.g. digestive gland metaplasia and pedal atrophy). A quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was recently developed and validated for the detection of WS-RLO DNA in abalone tissues, feces, and seawater. While confirmation of infection cannot be done by PCR-based assays alone, they can be used as proxies for infection in areas where the WS-RLO is established and are recommended for inclusion in all abalone health examinations. Avoidance of WS is best accomplished by the establishment of a health history, good husbandry practices, and multiple health examinations prior to the movement of animals.Population declines in wild and cultured abalones due to WS have been well documented along the northeastern Pacific Ocean. However, observed differences in species susceptibility to the disease are not well understood. The first objective of my dissertation was to examine the susceptibility of three temperate abalone species, the cool water (4-14°C) pinto or northern abalone (H. kamtschatkana), the intermediate water (8-18°C) red abalone, and the warm water (12-23°C) pink abalone (H. corrugata), to experimental WS infection at temperatures facilitating disease proliferation. Mortality data paired with histological and molecular detection of the WS pathogen confirmed that these abalone species exhibit different levels of susceptibility to infection and resistance to WS development ranging from high susceptibility and low resistance in pinto abalone to moderate/low susceptibility and resistance in red and pink abalones. The temperature associated with WS induced mortalities also varied among species: pinto abalone died at the lowest experimental temperature (17.32 ± 0.09°C), while red abalone died at an intermediate temperature (17.96 ± 0.16°C), and pink abalone required the highest temperature (18.84 ± 0.16°C). When data from the current and previous studies were examined, susceptibility to WS was inversely related to phylogenetic distance from white abalone (H. sorenseni), which had the highest susceptibility and lowest resistance of all abalone species tested prior to the current study. These results provide further evidence that an abalone’s thermal optima and phylogenetic relationship can determine its susceptibility to WS; species with cool water evolutionary histories are most susceptible to WS and the most susceptible species appear to be closely related. Differences among the thermal ranges of abalone species have broad implications for WS disease dynamics and highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms governing the abalone-WS relationship in order to properly manage declining abalone populations.My second dissertation objective was to elucidate important epidemiological information on the WS-RLO. The bacterium remains unculturable thereby limiting our understanding of WS disease dynamics. My goals were to: (1) determine the temporal stability of WS-RLO DNA outside of its abalone host in 14°C and 18°C seawater, (2) develop a standardized protocol for exposing abalones to known concentrations of WS-RLO DNA and (3) calculate the dose of WS-RLO DNA required to generate 50% infection prevalence (ID50) in the highly cultured red abalone. WS-RLO stability trials were conducted in October 2016, February 2017, and June 2017 during which qPCR analysis was used to quantify bacterial DNA for 7 days in seawater collected at an abalone farm in southern California where the pathogen is endemic. For all trials and temperature treatments, WS-RLO DNA was not stable in seawater longer than 2 days. To determine an ID50, groups of uninfected juvenile red abalone were subjected to 3-hour bath exposures of WS-RLO at four concentrations: 0, 103, 104, and 105 DNA copies/mL. Abalone feces were monitored bi-weekly for the presence of WS-RLO DNA and abalone tissues were sampled 9 weeks after dosing for histology and qPCR examination. Results from the ID50 indicated that our protocol was successful in generating WS-RLO infections and a pathogen dose of 2.3 x 103 DNA copies/mL was required to generate 50% infection prevalence in the tissue of red abalone as assessed by qPCR.The WS-RLO is considered an established bacterial pathogen in coastal CA seawaters and is of great concern to coastal managers and local abalone aquaculture facilities (AFs) conducting open or flow-through seawater culture methods. California AFs are at high risk for spillback (wild to farm) and spillover (farm to wild) disease transmission due to high abalone host densities and the use and release of coastal seawater that may contain the WS-RLO and its associated novel phage. To address these concerns, my third and final dissertation objective was to sample nearshore surface seawater from nine established wild black abalone sites and four red abalone AFs from Bodega Bay, Sonoma County, CA, US to Ventura County, CA, US including the Channel Islands over two consecutive summers to determine the presence and amount of WS-RLO and phage DNA via qPCR. In July 2010, WS-RLO DNA was detected as far north as Andrew Molera State Park, Big Sur, CA and as far south as San Nicolas Island (SNI). Phage DNA was detected from Monterey Bay, CA to SNI. In July 2011, WS-RLO DNA was detected as far north as Davenport, CA and as far south as SNI. The phage DNA detection range remained the same as the 2010 survey. Phage DNA loads did not vary by year at AF or wild sites. However, WS-RLO DNA loads were greater in 2011 than 2010 at wild sites, while those at AFs did not vary by year. In October 2013, surface seawater surveys were conducted at the two southern-most AFs in Cayucos and Goleta, CA to assess fine-scale WS-RLO DNA dilution potential from a point-source discharge. In the 2013 samples, WS-RLO DNA loads in seawater directly adjacent to the AFs were less than the mean levels detected at all wild black abalone sites previously surveyed within 50 to 500 m of the AFs effluent outfalls. While these findings present management concerns for both wild and cultured California abalones, it is important to acknowledge that PCR-based assays do not indicate the presence of viable pathogen or active infection and serve as a proxy for WS exposure. In order to fully assess the potential for wild and cultured abalone disease interactions, additional experiments should be conducted to determine the longevity and infectivity of the WS-RLO and novel phage in seawater. Collectively, these findings are critical components of disease dynamics that will help assess WS transmission risk within and among abalone populations and facilitate appropriate management and restoration strategies for both wild and cultured abalone species in WS-endemic areas.

T1  - Olympia Oyster Restoration: Habitat Suitability and Climate Considerations
AN  - 2439584822
AB  - Oyster habitat suitability index (HSI) models can support conservation and restoration planning, siting aquaculture projects, and other purposes. In recent decades, partners have undertaken efforts to restore populations of Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) in the Salish Sea. Olympia oyster restoration projects are more likely to become self-sustaining and contribute to overall population growth when sited in locations with optimal conditions. This study describes the development and application of a preliminary HSI model for Olympia oyster restoration in the southern Salish Sea. Environmental data and tolerance thresholds for six habitat variables – tidal elevation, salinity, temperature, current velocities, low salinity events, and water residence time – are compiled to create a geospatial index of suitability. This study identifies potentially suitable habitat throughout the study region. HSI output is compared to oyster observations and abundance at restored sites to evaluate accuracy and consider potential applications. While predictions of suitable habitat and oyster presence and abundance align in some locations, there are limitations to using the index as a tool for restoration planning. In addition, this study provides an example of how the HSI may be used to explore climate change considerations for restoration projects. The results of this study, in combination with other methods and information, may provide a useful preliminary tool for identifying potentially suitable locations for Olympia oyster restoration projects in the region.

T1  - Development of a Cold-Air Damming Index for Northern New England
AN  - 2437091728
AB  - Northern New England Cold Air Damming (CAD) is an important example of complex mesoscale flow interactions with orography that have an impact on low stratus, freezing rain, and sleet precipitation types. These wintry precipitation phenomena can have significant impact on the transportation industry if not forecasted and identified with high accuracy. While cold-air damming has been extensively studied in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region east of the Appalachians, only very limited research has been conducted on events where cold air becomes entrenched east and south of the northern Appalachians of New England. In this study, cold-air damming events are identified using hourly surface station data to calculate a Cold-Air Damming Index (CADINX). The index is calculated as the average surface potential temperature gradient between five "central" stations located in the cold air along the eastern edge of the Appalachians (in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts) and stations located in the warmer air west of the mountains (in Quebec, Vermont, New York) and stations located in the warmer air along the southern New England coast (in Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island). The index is set to zero if the central station is not colder than the surrounding stations. In addition, the index is only non-zero when higher sea level pressure is located to the north and east in the along mountain direction.  CAD events are objectively determined by applying the CADINX to hourly data for the five central stations. A CAD event is identified when three of the five stations have nonzero CADINX values for at least 6 consecutive hours. Once CAD events are identified, lected for each event: start/end time, peak time, average/max/min CADINX value. Initially, CAD events have been identified for a test month (Jan 2012) and for all of 2016. During these periods 28 northern New England CAD events have been identified. Examination of RUC analyses and observations show that these events exhibit “classic” CAD characteristics as described by Bell and Bosart (1988), where a thermal trough (ridge) of potential temperature exists east (west) of the mountain barrier with a surface anticyclone situated to the north of the damming region. While the synoptic configuration during these cases is similar and expected, the mesoscale features differ significantly from case to case. In approximately half of the CAD events examined thus far, the typical mesoscale pressure ridge associated with the low-level cold air is easily identified. The other half, however, indicated the presence of the low-level cold air with no sign of an associated mesoscale pressure ridge. Future work will extend the analysis to create a 15-year climatology of New England cold-air damming events using the CADINX, investigating the spectrum of CAD events, and  life cycles.

T1  - Getting a Head Start: Influential Early Experiences for Juvenile Corals and Community College Science Students
AN  - 2428088933
AB  - Coral reef resilience to ocean warming and recovery after high-mortality disturbances relies heavily on successful recruitment and survival of stony corals. Early in development, juvenile corals are particularly vulnerable to mortality due to ecological pressures (e.g., predation and algal overgrowth) and environmental stress, including ocean warming and acidification. While the success of juvenile corals is critical for reef resilience, our understanding of conditions supporting their survival under ocean warming remains limited due to their small size and cryptic nature. In this dissertation, I investigated the role of nutrition and tissue fusion in supporting thermal resistance of juvenile corals. To track the health and physiological condition of juvenile colonies during periods of warming, I first developed a non-destructive methodology using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) to measure tissue thickness and Symbiodiniaceae fluorescence in living corals, which provide key indicators of coral resilience to bleaching and physiological stress under high temperature. Using this methodology, I investigated the potential for heterotrophic feeding and seasonal temperature regimes to enhance juvenile Pocillopora acuta physiological condition (i.e., tissue thickness and Symbiodiniaceae fluorescence) over a 30-day period and support their resistance to subsequent exposure to thermal stress (N=716). I found that interactions between nutritional and thermal regimes are influential in supporting tissue growth and modulating symbiont populations during early juvenile development. Juvenile corals with access to zooplankton and those with prior exposure to cool temperature had 37% higher survival in ambient temperatures and 180% higher survival under thermal stress. In addition to optimal nutritional conditions, tissue fusion with neighboring recruits provides an additional pathway to rapidly increase colony size faster than by growth alone. Fusion between juvenile colonies provides an opportunity for increased genetic diversity within individual colonies because self-recognition systems do not develop until several months after settlement. To investigate the role of genetic diversity and colony size in promoting survival in thermal stress, I manipulated the genotypic richness (1-4 genotypes) and number of juveniles (1-4 juveniles) involved in tissue fusion (N=221). Fused juvenile P. acuta corals survived 5 days longer under high temperature than unfused juveniles. In warming conditions, tissue fusion provided a mechanism to increase total colony size and provide greater available biomass energy reserves and potential for total energy acquisition during stress. Within fused colonies, half of genetically diverse fusions survived 1.5 days longer under high temperature, which may be due to a rescue effect provided by more thermally tolerant genotypes. As oceans continue to warm, these “head start” experiences may become increasingly important in supporting the survival of fast-growing, brooding corals, which are often the first corals to recruit and seed reefs following mortality events. For science students early in their education, involvement in scientific research can also provide a “head start” opportunity as they navigate through the “leaky pipeline” in their pursuit of a science career. I involved five community college students in my research of coral biology and used qualitative methods to understand the impacts of this experience on their science identities and career trajectories. Over the course of a one-year study, students reported increases in their knowledge and understanding of science but remained uncertain of their professional science identity. To support student persistence in science, research internships should integrate career exploration with practice in research and should continue to develop stronger integration between scientific and educational research.

T1  - Invasion in the Light of Evolution: an Integrative Approach Using Two Widespread Widow Spider Species
AN  - 2425006766
AB  - As invasive species spread around the world, understanding the factors underlying invasion success has become increasingly important. Using an evolutionary perspective to examine biological invasions, I investigated how organisms are able to rapidly adapt to new environments, and how selection on phenotypic traits changed over time during sequential stages of the invasion process. In this thesis, I used lab and field studies to assess the importance of behaviour, physiology, morphology, and plasticity to widow spider invasion success. Using this variation in invasion history, I explored patterns across organismal, population, and species-level scales. In Chapter Two, investigated the effects of metabolic rate on behaviour in Australian redback spiders, Latrodectus hasselti, and links between behavioural variation and fitness components measured in the field and laboratory. My work showed that metabolic rate influences fitness via correlation with multiple behaviours, but that metabolic rate alone does not drive all individual behavioural differences. In Chapter Three, I tested preadaptation and local adaptation in a native and an invasive population of L. hasselti to investigate tolerance of novel environmental conditions experienced in the invasive range. In this chapter, I showed that invasive populations may be able to thrive in novel environmental conditions because of increased behavioural plasticity, tolerance of temperature fluctuations, and higher fecundity. In Chapter Four, I compared populations of L. hasselti that are native, established invasive, and newly invasive, and assessed the relative importance of phenotypic traits likely to predispose a species to invasion success. I found that invasive populations of Australian redback spiders diverged from the native Australian population in behaviour, life history, and morphology. In Chapter Five, I tested hypotheses of behaviourally mediated spatial sorting and changes in tradeoffs during invasive spread using two independent invasions of brown widow spiders. I found similar patterns of increased dispersal propensity in two independent invasions of brown widow populations in Israel and the United States. These common patterns suggest that dispersal ability under positive selection in invasive populations, particularly the recently established populations. I infer that behavioural plasticity and dispersal propensity, together with a preference for human-disturbed environments, may underlie invasion and establishment in invasive widow species. In sum, my thesis has expanded our knowledge of how evolutionary processes affect the spread of invasive species through local adaptation, selective filters in the invasion process, and spatial sorting.

T1  - Thermal Dependence of <em>Eleutherodactylus coqui</em> Vocalization on Hawaii Island
AN  - 2423793703
AB  - The invasive coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) has rapidly colonized four main Hawaiian islands, and its populations have spread over large areas producing a number of negative social, ecological, and economic impacts. On Hawaii Island, coqui frogs occur over major tracts of coastal forests and the lower boundaries of montane wet forests at higher elevations, and population sizes and densities are highest in the state. In their native Puerto Rico, coqui frogs are found from sea level to the top of the island (1,065 m) and it is currently an open question how high coqui frog populations will eventually range on Hawaii Island. Cold temperature limitation is a strong hypothesis for the current altitudinal distribution of this species on Hawaii Island. In this study, the thermal limitations on coqui frog calling behavior were determined in order to infer if cooler high altitude temperatures serve as a limiting condition for the continued expansion of coqui frog populations. Coqui frogs were found to stop calling around 14 °C at high elevation and around 19 °C at low elevations while normal levels of chorusing occurred around 17 °C and 21 °C at high and low elevations, respectively. Differences in mean air temperature observed between elevations were very similar for different degrees of calling activity, suggesting that higher elevation populations have acclimatized or adapted to be active under cooler conditions. In addition to low temperature, low moisture was also found to be associated with low levels of coqui frog calling activity. Strong negative relationships between temperature and temporal calling parameters (inter-note interval and total call length), and strong positive relationships between temperature and call note (‘co’ and ‘qui’) center frequencies were observed for high elevation coqui frog populations. These relationships between temperature and coqui frog calling support some observations reported over smaller temperature ranges in previous studies. The coqui frogs’ thermal tolerances imply that they can occupy habitats throughout all the Hawaiian islands except for the alpine and summit areas and drier grassland and shrub environments. While the effects of coqui frogs on lowland ecosystems replete with non-native species have been unexpectedly modest, the frogs could have greater impact at higher elevations where native flora and fauna assemblages dominate. Such sensitive habitats should be monitored for possible unappreciated effects of coqui frog populations.

T1  - Looking for a Bottleneck: Assessment of Factors Influencing Post-Stocking Survival of Advanced Fingerling Walleye<em> Sander vitreus</em>
AN  - 2421325575
AB  - Walleye Sander vitreus is a highly valued sportfish in North America. In 2001, 3.8 million anglers spent approximately 51.9 million days angling for Walleye (USFWS-USCB 2002). The popularity of Walleye has resulted in situations where demand exceeds supply, which has led to the development and implementation of stocking programs across the United States and Canada to enhance fishing opportunities (Lathrop et al. 2002), rebuild depleted stocks (Johnson et al. 1996; Li et al. 1996), and mitigate poor year classes from variable natural recruitment (Mitzner 1992; Johnson et al. 1996; Jennings et al. 2005; Logsdon et al. 2016; Reed and Staples 2017). However, mortality rates of stocked fishes can vary widely (27-95%; Stein et al. 1981; Buckmeier et al. 2005; Freedman et al. 2012; Weber et al. 2020) and small changes in survival can result in large differences in year-class strength and success of stocking initiatives.Numerous biotic and abiotic factors can influence survival during early life stages of fish, such as transportation and stocking practices (Forsberg et al. 2001; Barton et al. 2003), predation (Santucci and Wahl 1993; Buckmeier et al. 2005; Thompson et al. 2016), available forage (Johnson et al. 1996; Hoxmeier et al. 2006), competition (Le Pape and Bonhommeau 2015; Chase et al. 2016), fish origin (Kellison et al. 2000; Jonsson and Jonsson 2003; Pollock et al. 2007), body size (Litvak and Leggett 1992; Meekan et al. 2006; Grausgruber and Weber in press), and water temperatures (Akimova et al. 2016; Wagner et al. 2017). Furthermore, the aforementioned factors do not act independently of each other, making it challenging to determine their importance. The growth-predation hypothesis predicts that selective mortality should decline as individuals grow and increase in size (Anderson 1988). Increases in size are also associated with decreased predation risk (Post and Evans 1989; Miranda and Hubbard 1994), where larger body size can reduce the chances of predation due to improved maneuverability and swimming speed (Videler 1993). The argument of “bigger-is-better” (Butler 1988; Miller et al. 1988; Litvak and Leggett 1992) has led hatcheries to raise progressively larger fingerling Walleye (Halverson 2008). However, hatchery production is an expensive and labor-intensive process, where production costs are generally positively related to rearing duration and fish size (Wedemeyer 2001). Therefore, it is advantageous to evaluate factors hypothesized to limit post-stocking Walleye survival (e.g., effects of transport duration and handling practices as well as post-stocking predation and starvation) to assess whether rearing larger fingerling Walleye (hereafter referred to as Walleye) is justifiable. The objectives of this dissertation included 1) evaluating relationships between Walleye transport duration with changes in water chemistry parameters, Walleye physiology, and short-term (48 hr) mortality; 2) evaluating whether consumed Walleye total length was related to predator total length, predator gape height, or the probability of predation, as well as assessed whether length distributions varied among stocked, recaptured, and consumed Walleye, and estimate cumulative consumption for up to two months by a suite of piscivores; 3) evaluating diet composition and shifts of stocked Walleye; and 4) use mark-recapture techniques to evaluate the influence of predation, stocking environment, and Walleye physical characteristics on apparent weekly survival of Walleye from stocking until ice cover.For my first objective, I used two approaches (i.e., field and experimental evaluation) to evaluate relationships between Walleye transport duration with changes in water chemistry parameters, Walleye whole blood glucose and plasma cortisol concentrations, and short-term (48 hr) mortality. For the field evaluation, Walleye were transported between 3.5 to 6 hours and stocked into holding cages located at one of six systems. Water quality and Walleye stress (via whole blood glucose and plasma cortisol) and mortality were evaluated prior to, during, and at 0, 2, 24, and 48 hours post-transportation. During transport, water temperatures generally decreased while carbon dioxide concentrations fluctuated between 2.7 and 22.5 mg/L. Walleye whole blood glucose and plasma cortisol concentrations varied by system and time since transport. Changes in carbon dioxide concentrations were associated with changes in whole blood glucose concentrations. However, cumulative survival rates and plasma cortisol concentrations were not associated with water quality parameters or transportation duration. For the experimental evaluation, Walleye were transported either 0, 0.5, 3, or 5 hours and stress and mortality were evaluated up to 48 hours post-transport. Unlike, the field evaluation, the experimental evaluation used a staggered loading protocol to transport all Walleye on the same truck during the same day and allowed us to keep fish densities in each of the transportation truck compartments consistent throughout the experiment. Furthermore, in the experimental evaluation, I evaluated additional water quality parameters, not included in the field evaluation. In the experimental evaluation, total ammonia nitrogen, carbon dioxide, pH, and water temperature increased with transportation duration while the total alkalinity of the transport water decreased. Plasma cortisol and whole blood glucose concentrations of Walleye transported longer durations took longer to decline relative to those not transported. However, water quality parameters were not associated with changes in whole blood glucose and plasma cortisol concentrations. Despite increases in stress, Walleye mortality was low (2.5%) 48 hours after transportation. Understanding Walleye tolerance to transportation induced stress has the potential to enhance stocking programs by providing the opportunity for managers to make informed Walleye transportation practices.My second objective was to evaluate predation on Walleye, including whether consumed Walleye total length was related to predator total length, predator gape height, or the probability of predation, as well as assessed if length distributions varied among stocked, recaptured, and consumed Walleye. I also estimated cumulative consumption by a suite of piscivores (Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu, Northern Pike Esox lucius, adult Walleye, and Muskellunge E. masquinongy) for two months post-stocking. During fall 2015-2017, 301 Walleye were recovered from 3,514 predator stomachs. Quantile regression models (mean = 50th percentile, maximum = 85th percentile, and minimum = 15th percentile) indicated that consumed Walleye total length was not related to predator total length or gape height (P > 0.05), but the probability of predation decreased by 0.02 for every 10 mm increase in Walleye total length. Length distributions indicated consumed Walleye were generally smaller, whereas recaptured Walleye tended to be larger than stocked fish. To estimate cumulative consumption of Walleye by Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and adult Walleye, I used Schnabel models to estimate predator population size and bioenergetics models to determine the biomass of consumed Walleye from stocking through ice-up (mid- November) during fall 2017 and 2018. Across years and systems, 3,272 predators were collected and 257 Walleye were recovered from predator stomachs. Northern Pike (0.12 Walleye per predator ± 0.32 SD) had the highest proportion of Walleye in their diets followed by Largemouth Bass (0.11 ± 0.30 Walleye per predator) and adult Walleye (0.04 ± 0.20 Walleye per predator). Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and adult Walleye collectively consumed between 2.4-27.2% of the stocked Walleye within two months of stocking, with higher proportions of smaller (<220 mm) Walleye in predator diets. In East Okoboji, highest proportions of age-0 Walleye in predator diets generally occurred 14 days after the most recent stocking event with the proportion of age-0 Walleye in predator diets decreasing thereafter. However, in West Okoboji, Northern Pike, adult Walleye, and Largemouth Bass had increasing proportions of age-0 Walleye in diets between stocking events. Collectively, results suggest that local piscivores have the potential to consume more than 27% of stocked age-0 Walleye within the first two months of stocking and that predation risk generally decreases with Walleye size. Thus, post-stocking predation can negatively influence Walleye stocking success, especially if the sizes of Walleye stocked have high predation risk.Hatchery propagation techniques, such as pellet-rearing, can result in impaired post-stocking feeding behavior of fishes. My third objective was to evaluate diet composition and diet shifts of Walleye. Specifically, my objective was to compare fall diets of wild and stocked Walleye by evaluating the proportion of empty stomachs as well as proportions of zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and fish in diets. Percent similarity index values were also used to assess the percent similarity of wild and fingerling diets. In total, 590 Walleye were gastrically lavaged, with wild Walleye making up 9.7% and stocked Walleye making up 90.3% of the samples. The average proportion of empty stomachs differed between wild and stocked Walleye, with stocked Walleye having higher average (± 95% CI) proportions of empty stomachs (0.40 ± 0.10) compared to wild fish (0.15 ± 0.09). Proportion of empty stomachs and proportion of Walleye with zooplankton in diets decreased with days post-stocking. Stocked Walleye had a greater proportion of benthic invertebrates in their diet than wild Walleye whereas wild Walleye consumed more fish relative to stocked Walleye. However, the presence of zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and fish in wild (TL = 129-215 mm) and fingerling (TL = 94-228 mm) Walleye diets were not related to Walleye total length. Finally, percent similarity index values for wild and stocked Walleye diets were highly variable and ranged from 0.0 to 67.9%. Collectively, my results suggest that fall stocked fingerling Walleye consume different prey items compared to their wild counterparts for up to 49 days post-stocking. Results pertaining to post-stocking Walleye diet composition may influence post-stocking survival.Numerous factors can independently and dependently influence the survival of stocked Walleye, including environmental conditions, predation, and Walleye total length, condition, and post-stocking diet composition. However, the relative effects of these factors on survival of stocked Walleye are challenging to evaluate and rarely assessed simultaneously. Thus, my fourth objective used mark-recapture techniques to evaluate the influence of predation, stocking environment, and Walleye physical characteristics (total length and condition at time of stocking) on apparent weekly survival from stocking until ice cover. Each fall (2015, 2016, and 2017), roughly 4,000 stocked Walleye were implanted with passive integrated transponder tags, stocked, and recaptured via boat electrofishing. Cormack-Jolly-Seber recapture models estimated that Walleye weekly apparent survival was negatively related to the weekly average proportion of Walleye recovered from predator diets (β = -2.86; 95% credibility interval = -5.69 to -0.17) as well as weekly average water temperatures (β = 0.09; 95% credibility interval = -0.08 to 0.20). At an average fall water temperature, mean Walleye apparent survival was 0.83 (95% credibility interval = 0.75 to 0.91) when no Walleye were recovered from predator diets and declined to 0.54 (95% credibility interval = 0.28 to 0.84) when Walleye comprised 60% of predator diets. Between 41-97% of stocked Walleye were lost to mortality from stocking through ice-up among the three years, indicating that the two months post-stocking is a critical period for survival. Our results suggest that post-stocking Walleye survival is most influenced by post-stocking predation rather than individual Walleye or environmental factors. Thus, strategies that minimize predation following stocking may result in the greatest improvements in Walleye post-stocking survival.

T1  - Urban Tree Species Classification for Utility Outage Forecasting Using Multi-Sensor Data Fusion with Machine Learning and Spatial Statistics
AN  - 2414442209
AB  - Trees play a vital role in the urban environment in various aspects ranging from environmental to economic benefits.  While offering many advantages, trees also pose risk to key urban infrastructure such as utility infrastructure networks, particularly during severe weather events. Remote sensing presents a timely and cost-effective method for urban tree inventory to provide invaluable information to city managers and utility companies for planning, development, and maintenance of urban infrastructure. This dissertation evaluated urban tree species classification at unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), airborne, and satellite scales and across a variety of sensors – to include multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) – in order to advance the knowledge of the capabilities and limitations of remote sensing for urban tree inventories. This work established a method for urban tree species classification with limited training samples using UAV-based data fusion approach. Additionally, we presented the first application of Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) for urban tree species classification and demonstrated its improved performance over two commonly used machine learning classifiers, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Finally, this work developed a grid-cell data fusion approach for combining multi-scale remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) datasets to assess the effect of scale and spatial variation on the estimation of tree-related power outages across a regional utility network. While only incorporating LiDAR data for tree canopy metrics, results indicated a need to examine the impact of species type and health of trees to improve outage risk prediction models as species diversity and growing conditions vary significantly across an urban landscape. Overall, this dissertation represents a detailed study on urban trees at various scales and across multiple sensors to provide an improved understanding of effective detection and classification approaches for varying applications or research goals.

T1  - The Development of a Diatom-Based Index of Biotic Integrity to Assess Water Quality of Texas Streams
AN  - 2408548926
AB  - Water pollution is increasing as water availability is decreasing in Texas, causing an immediate need for more and multi-pronged approaches to water quality monitoring. Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) are a promising rapid method to assess water pollution levels, and some have been previously produced for urban streams in Texas. However, many small rural streams remain understudied. Diatoms are excellent candidates for an IBI due to their abundance, ubiquity, species-specific environmental optima, species-identifiable frustule, and rapid generational turnover. These characteristics of diatoms are ideal for detecting the long-term effects of environmental pollutants on a stream community. The objective of this investigation was to construct an IBI for sixteen rural streams in north-central Texas. During this process three hypotheses will be tested: 1) Diatom assemblages will differ between streams that have varying water chemistry parameters, 2) Diatom assemblages at the same site will vary between seasons, 3) Diatom assemblages will be significantly different among the three river basins as a reflection of water chemistry parameters and seasonal changes. Rock and water samples were collected in spring and summer of 2018 to account for seasonal variability in the diatom assemblage. Water chemistry measurements for pH, DO, temperature, conductivity, and stream velocity were taken during sample collection and TN and TP were analyzed in lab. Diatoms were chemically digested, then counted and identified using light microscopy. Descriptive analyses included several biodiversity indices like species richness, Simpson Index, Shannon diversity, evenness, and equitability. The biodiversity indices support the first hypothesis showing that all sites with differing environmental variables had varying species richness, diversity, and evenness. T-tests of assemblages were statistically significant differences in assemblages between seasons, supporting the second hypothesis at species-level seasonal differences in diversity, though not genus-level differences. Canonical correspondence analysis of sites within each river basin were used to correlate diatom species to environmental parameters. Four IBIs, one for each river basin, and a general IBI which combined all diatom data, were constructed with indicator values that represent the environmental sensitivity or tolerance of a genus. The IBIs were applied to some of the site data. A one-way ANOVA performed on the IBI scores did not support any significant differences between the different IBI scores. Therefore, the third hypothesis was not supported, and moreover was irrelevant to the application of IBI construction because of the focus of genus-level data.

T1  - Movement and Migration Ecology of Alaskan Golden Eagles
AN  - 2404010141
AB  - Golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos are distributed across the Holarctic; however, in Alaska and other northern areas,  many are long-distance migrants.  Being soaring birds, golden eagles can use weather and features of the energy landscape to offset the energetic costs of movement and migration.  In this dissertation, I investigate how dynamic energy landscapes, in addition to other habitat and anthropogenic features, affect the movement and migration ecology of Alaskan golden eagles; in most cases I did such by developing and applying new, biologically-appropriate statistical methods.  First, I identified a single, discrete navigation decision that each eagle made during migration and determined which weather variables are primary factors in driving that decision.  I found that wind was the primary correlate to the decision, consistent with eagles likely avoiding poor migration conditions and choosing routes based on favorable wind conditions.  Second, I investigated how different forms of flight subsidies, which were orographic uplift, thermal uplift, and wind support, drove behavioral budgets and migratory pacing of eagles.  I found a consistent daily rhythm in eagle behavior and migratory pace, seemingly driven by daily development of thermal uplift, with extended periods of slower-paced movements, consistent with periods of opportunistic foraging.  Third, I investigated the effects of anthropogenic linear features, such as roads and railroads, on eagle movement during migration.  I found that eagles selected for roads during spring migration and were more likely to be near roads when making slower-paced movements, which would be most frequent during times when limited thermal uplift is available.  Lastly, I compared how floaters (breeding-age, non-territorial individuals) and territorial eagles used space and selected for resources, specifically interested in how their movements and space use might overlap.  I found that floater space use was much more expansive, yet they only selected for habitats and resources slightly differently than territorial eagles.  I also found their home ranges overlap substantially, suggesting that floaters play a key role in the population ecology of migratory golden eagles in Alaska.

T1  - Effects of Temperature, Phenology, and Geography on Butterfly Population Dynamics under Climate Change
AN  - 2400554706
AB  - Global climate change caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is increasing the risk of species extinctions worldwide. Ectotherms are likely to be particularly vulnerable because their basic physiological functions such as development and reproduction are strongly influenced by external temperature. To discern the potential magnitude of future species declines, it is thus vitally important to gain a mechanistic understanding of how temperature determines population responses. Some of these mechanisms include the effects of temperature on survival and reproduction, the effects of temperature on developmental rates, and geographical variation in temperature. I chose two butterfly species, the Appalachian Brown (Satyrodes appalachia) and the Saint Francis’ Satyr (Neonympha mitchellii francisci) to answer the following questions: 1) How will projected warming affect population growth rates of S. appalachia? 2) How will temperature and phenology combine to affect growth rates of S. appalachia? 3) How do S. appalachia survival rate responses to warming compare across a mid-latitude species’ range? 4) How can machine learning be used to optimize models to predict phenology of N. mitchellii francisci under different emissions scenarios? I carried out field warming experiments at all annual life stages of S. appalachia to fit functions describing survival and reproductive rates under a range of increased temperatures. I developed a population model based on these vital rate responses and downscaled climate datasets to project future population growth rates under the RCP 8.5 “business as usual” emissions scenario. The model projected that annual growth rates will shift from growing to shrinking in the 2060s, and when predation was incorporated into the model, shrinking occurred by the late 2020s. My findings suggest population declines for a non-rare species under a higher emissions scenario. I carried out field experiments to evaluate the timing of annual life stages relative to the critical photoperiod triggering the onset of winter diapause. I combined these measures with downscaled climate datasets to project annual ratios of S. appalachia individuals developing directly into a third generation versus going into diapause. Incorporation of these into the above population model revealed that the indirect effect of temperature on phenology had a positive effect on population growth that behaved antagonistically to the negative direct effects of temperature. Under RCP 8.5, the model projected that the annual growth rate will remain above one before 2020, but as temperatures continue to increase throughout the 21st Century, the negative direct effects of temperature outweigh the positive indirect effects and the population growth rates shift from growing to shrinking. I evaluated juvenile survival rate responses to temperature of S. appalachia populations from northern and southern range limits. I compared these responses to future projected temperatures at both locations. I found no difference between the survival rates of individuals from the two populations. Comparison of projected survival rates suggested that southern populations have already surpassed optima for thermal demographic response, while northern populations may surpass optima by the middle of the century under RCP 8.5. I used machine learning algorithms to optimize degree day models predicting the annual emergence of N. mitchellii francisci. I validated the use of several algorithms and identified the RandomForest algorithm as the best classifier. Using downscaled climate data, RandomForest projected a decreasing mean date of annual first emergence, with projected advances of approximately 1.4 and 2.1 days per decade for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 respectively. My findings suggest that mechanistic field-based approaches are imperative to predict future effects of climate change. My methods are applicable to a wide range of ectothermic organisms with complex lifecycles. Under higher emissions, my results highlight a critical window of time in the early 21st Century for conservation action.

T1  - Population-Specific Thermal Tolerance of Central Valley Fall-Run Chinook Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</em>) Embryos, Alevins, and Fry at the Southern-Most Extent of Their Distribution
AN  - 2384210501
AB  - Dams are constructed on rivers to manage water in the downstream environment. Dams provide many benefits to humans, but often harms fish species such as Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Reduced discharge from dams alters natural flow regimes, affecting river temperatures. Species-specific temperature criteria at the southern-most extent of the species’ distribution often goes unmet. The aim of this study was to test the effects of river-specific water temperature regimes on fall-run Chinook Salmon (O. tshawytscha) egg to fry survival and rate of development. Embryos were exposed to three different temperature regimes in a hatchery setting, during two study years. Each temperature regime exposed a different life-stage to elevated water temperatures. Results from study year 1 indicate that survival was affected by both temperature regime and parental cross. Two of the five crosses had >80% survival when exposed to lethal water temperatures (>15.6°C). Results from study year 2 suggests that the egg and eyed-egg life-stages are more thermally sensitive than the hatch (alevin) or fry stage. Rate of development was significantly different between temperature treatments in year 2. Embryos in the warming regime took approximately twice as long to reach each life-stage as in the cooling or in the constant regime. Developing a population-specific temperature criterion is necessary to develop a strategic method for managing downstream water releases. Restoration programs can employ a population-specific temperature criterion that will likely make it possible to meet the needs of both humans and fish.

T1  - Tales of an ‘Invisible’ Life Stage: Survival and Physiology Among Terrestrial Juvenile Ambystomatid Salamanders
AN  - 2491081264
AB  - The vital rates (e.g., survival, growth, and reproduction) of distinct life stages within a species are known to influence the growth and persistence of populations. As such, studies describing stage-specific vital rates, and the factors that shape variation in these rates across species and populations, can help to improve our understanding of population dynamics and species distributions. Moreover, the insights gained from such studies can guide the prioritization of populations for conservation efforts and inform the selection of management strategies under predicted climate and land use changes. Yet life stage-specific vital rate estimates, and characterizations of the physiological responses that influence demographic rates under variable conditions, are lacking for most species.Amphibians are experiencing drastic population declines across the globe. As amphibians exhibit complex lifecycles, wherein unique life stages rely on divergent resources and habitat types, examinations of distinct life stages may be particularly critical for enhancing amphibian conservation efforts. Specifically, juveniles are known to play a critical role in amphibian population dynamics, but are relatively understudied compared with other life stages due to their small body size and often elusive life histories. The main objective of this dissertation was to elucidate survival rates, and physiological characteristics that contribute to survival, among terrestrial juveniles of multiple complex lifecycle pond-breeding salamanders in the genus Ambystoma.I first estimated juvenile survival rates among three ambystomatid species (A. annulatum, A. maculatum and A. texanum) by conducting an 11-month capture-mark- xiii recapture study within semi-natural enclosures. I found juvenile survival rates to be constant through time and comparable among species. These similarities indicated that vital rate estimates from congeneric, ecologically similar species can serve as robust place-holder information to examine the population dynamics of the many amphibian species for which stage-specific data are lacking. Next, I reared larvae of five species (A. annulatum, A. maculatum, A. opacum, A. talpoideum, and A. texanum) from populations along an ~200 km latitudinal gradient in Missouri, USA to metamorphosis under common conditions. By performing flow-through respirometry on juveniles, I found respiratory surface area water loss (RSAWL) and standard metabolic rates (SMR) to differ between species. Though SMR showed no relationship with locality, RSAWL was weakly positively correlated with latitude. This suggested that juvenile ambystomatids exposed to warmer average conditions at more southern latitudes, and thus a higher desiccation risk, may demonstrate the locally adaptive regulation of RSAWL compared with juveniles from northern populations. Given common rearing, it is likely that differences among species and populations had a genetic basis, and were not solely the result of phenotypic plasticity. I then conducted a replicated experiment to evaluate how juvenile RSAWL, SMR, and body mass might influence individual fitness by releasing A. maculatum and A. opacum juveniles from the previous study into the semi-natural enclosures for seven months of capture-mark-recapture. Examining known survival at three time points during the study, I found juveniles with higher initial body mass and/or lower SMR to have a higher likelihood of survival, particularly under warm initial conditions. There was no effect of RSAWL on survival. Acclimation experiments with surviving salamanders revealed that thermal tolerances and SMR demonstrated plastic responses to warming. Further, a simulation of juvenile survival following high temperatures suggested that the two study species may demonstrate diverging juvenile survival rates after being thermally challenged due to distinct acclimation strategies.Collectively, the results of these studies shed light on a key vital rate for ambystomatid population dynamics in a life stage that is difficult to observe. I compiled the findings of these and other ambystomatid studies to propose management objectives and strategies to conserve A. annulatum, an endemic species of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains. This effort demonstrated the utility of life stage-specific demographic and physiological information for guiding the conservation of biodiversity.

T1  - Effects of <em>in situ </em>Oceanic Warming on Marine Benthic Recruitment and Community Development in Antarctica
AN  - 2481916217
AB  - With coastal sea temperature predicted to increase 1.5-2°C by 2050, it is important to assess how the communities of coastal marine habitats will respond, in order to predict overall biodiversity and ecosystem level impacts. In this study I used the novel technology of heated settlement panels which heated the surface of each panel and a thin layer of overlying water to 1°C or 2°C above ambient temperatures, thus mimicking oceanic warming predictions for 2050 (IPCC, 2014). This technology was used to assess the effects of in situ elevated warming on benthic early community development.<br/>In a first experiment, panels were deployed at the BAS Rothera Research station, Antarctica for a period of 18 months. To evaluate whether the encrusting species had acclimated to the warmer temperatures, I performed upper thermal limit and heat shock experiments on one of the main benthic colonisers, the spirorbid worm Romanchella perrieri. These data indicated a lack of both acclimation and a heat shock response in this species. This suggested that R. perrieri were resisting at the higher temperatures rather than successfully acclimating. An RNA-Seq approach was also was with another major spirorbid coloniser, Protoleospira stalagmia. The transcriptome data suggested the gradual shutting down of cellular pathways in the organisms in the 2°C treatment, supporting the observations of lack of acclimation in R. perrieri. Biofilm analyses were also carried out on the same panels. In contrast to the invertebrate results, there were very few differences observed in the microbial community across experimental treatments. Thus indicating that microbial communities may be more robust in the face of future climate change compared with metazoans.<br/>In a second experiment, these panels were deployed in a temperate region, the Menai Strait, Wales. Development of the communities was monitored on a seasonal basis over a period of 13 months. Whilst communities varied seasonally, there was no significant difference in overall composition or species biodiversity between treatments. The exception to this was the overlapping evaluations in June 2015 and June 2016. Overall percentage cover was higher in June 2016 compared with June 2015, compromising three dominant species: the barnacle Balanus crenatus, the encrusting worm Spirobranchus triqueter and the bryozoan Electra pilosa.<br/>Furthermore species composition was different in June 2016 and June 2015 was different in the control panels compared to the heated panels. Thus in warmer years even a +1°C or a +2°C<br/>15<br/>temperature rise can significantly affect temperate benthic ecosystems, producing a thermal tipping point for some species. These data validate the application of this heated settlement panel technology in temperate ecosystems.

T1  - Vulnerability and Adaptability of Africa's Inland Fisheries to Climate Change: An Interdisciplinary Approach to a Multi-dimensional Conservation Challenge
AN  - 2481515993
AB  - The unprecedented rate of contemporary climate warming is affecting ecosystems globally; and inland waters are predicted to be among the most vulnerable as they are already heavily exploited by humans for numerous ecosystem services. My doctoral research examined the effects of climate change on the inland fisheries of continental Africa, with a special focus on the ecological and social consequences for the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa. First, I used a trait-based climate-change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) of African freshwater fishes to document biogeographical patterns of climate change threats across the continent. By integrating species traits with projected climatic changes, I identified regions and species that are most at risk, and demonstrated that nearly 40% of African freshwater fish species are highly vulnerable to climate change. This study was also important in highlighting several cases where classic conservation approaches have overlooked species and regions of climate change concern. In the remainder of this dissertation, I focused on the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa, a region that emerged as highly threatened in the CCVA. In a suite of short- and long-term acclimation experiments, I tested the capacity of a commercially harvested species (the Nile perch, Lates niloticus), to cope with climate change stresses through physiological adjustments of their thermal tolerance limits. I acclimated Nile perch to a wide range of temperatures over various exposure times (3-days, 3-weeks, 3-months), and measured changes to upper thermal tolerance, metabolic performance, growth, and organ development among temperatures and acclimation times. I found that Nile perch showed evidence for compensation in upper thermal tolerance and metabolic rate over all exposure times, and demonstrated that temperature-induced cardiac remodelling influenced aerobic function in this species. The key findings of this work challenge long-held assumptions that tropical species have limited thermal plasticity for coping with climate change-related stressors. Finally, I investigated vulnerability and resilience of fishery-based social-ecological systems in the Lake Victoria basin. Household surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews were conducted in five villages ranging from low to high-dependence of fishing to determine how households and communities are affected by and respond to climate-mediated changes in the fishery. I found that climate change is highly disruptive to fishery-based livelihoods, causing social-ecological feedbacks that tend to entrench households and communities into a singular dependence on an already threatened and declining resource. However, fishers' growing awareness of these interactions can lead to adaptive actions that improve resilience to the ongoing changes in this ecosystem. Overall this thesis provides critical insight into climate change vulnerability of Africa's inland aquatic environments, and highlights several mechanisms that may underlie resilience in fish species and the human communities that rely on them.Alternate abstract:Le réchauffement climatique contemporain procède à un rythme sans précédent et affecte les écosystèmes à une échelle mondiale. Les eaux intérieures (lacs et rivières) sont parmi les écosystèmes les plus vulnérables de par leur forte exploitation par l'homme pour de nombreux services écologiques. Ma recherche de doctorat porte sur les effets des changements climatiques sur les pêcheries en Afrique continentale, mettant l'emphase sur les conséquences écologiques et sociales de ces changements dans le bassin du lac Victoria en Afrique de l'Est. En utilisant une approche dite « par traits », j'ai d'abord complété une évaluation de la vulnérabilité aux changements climatiques (EVCC) chez les poissons d'eau douce africains pour documenter les patrons biogéographiques de la menace liée au changement climatique à travers ce continent. En combinant une base de données de traits des espèces et des cartes de changements climatiques prévus, j'ai identifié les régions et les espèces les plus à risque et j'ai démontré que près de 40% des espèces de poissons d'eau douce africains sont très vulnérables aux changements climatiques. Cette étude a par ailleurs mis en évidence plusieurs cas où les approches de priorisation traditionnelles en conservation ont omis certaines espèces ou régions à risque. Pour les autres chapitres de cette thèse, je me suis concentrée sur le bassin du lac Victoria en Afrique de l'Est, une région identifiée comme étant fortement à risque dans l'EVCC. Dans une série d'expériences d'acclimatation à court et à long terme avec une espèce pêchée commercialement dans la région (la perche du Nil : Lates niloticus), j'ai d'abord testé la capacité d'adaptation de cette espèce aux changements climatiques via un ajustement physiologique de la tolérance thermique. Des perches du Nil ont été acclimatées à diverses températures et pour différentes durées d'exposition (3 jours, 3 semaines ou 3 mois), pour ensuite prendre des mesures de tolérance thermique supérieure, de performance métabolique, du taux de croissance et des taux de développement des organes. J'ai observé une compensation de la tolérance thermique supérieure et du taux métabolique en réponse au réchauffement peu importe la durée d'exposition, et j'ai démontré que le remodelage cardiaque induit par le réchauffement influençait la performance aérobique chez cette espèce. Les résultats principaux de ces études remettent en question l'hypothèse classique stipulant que les espèces tropicales ne possèdent qu'une capacité de plasticité thermique limitée pour faire face aux changements climatiques. Finalement, j'ai aussi étudié la vulnérabilité et la résilience des systèmes socio-écologiques basés sur la pêche dans le bassin du lac Victoria. Pour déterminer si les fluctuations dans les pêcheries liées au changement climatique ont un impact sur les communautés de pêcheurs, des enquêtes auprès des ménages, des groupes de discussion et des entretiens avec des informateurs clés ont été réalisés dans cinq villages variant dans leur dépendance à la pêche. J'ai constaté que le changement climatique perturbe fortement les activités économiques liées à la pêche et qu'il induit des boucles de rétroaction socio-écologiques amenant les ménages et les communautés vers une dépendance accrue à une ressource déjà menacée et en déclin. Néanmoins, la sensibilisation croissante des pêcheurs à ces enjeux entraîne parfois des actions adaptatives qui améliorent la résilience aux changements opérant dans l'écosystème local. Dans son ensemble, cette thèse améliore notre compréhension de la vulnérabilité au changement climatique aux sein des environnements dulcicoles Africains et elle identifie plusieurs mécanismes pouvant améliorer la résilience des espèces de poissons et des communautés humaines qui en dépendent.

T1  - Characterizing the Link between Biological Membranes and Thermal Physiology in Antarctic Notothenioid Fishes
AN  - 2461616960
AB  - The Antarctic notothenioid fishes are among the most stenothermal animals on the planet and are likely to be vulnerable to the effects of global climate change. The physiological mechanisms that govern the thermal tolerance of Antarctic notothenioids are not fully understood. Membrane integrity and structure are highly sensitive to temperature and are critical to maintenance of cellular function. The two central hypotheses of this work are: (1) Variation in physical and biochemical membrane properties exists among notothenioids that display differences in thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of physiological processes; and (2) Membranes of Notothenia coriiceps undergo lipid remodeling in response to long-term thermal change in order to conserve membrane properties. Physical and biochemical properties of biological membranes from several tissues (cardiac ventricles and brain) were analyzed in several species of notothenioids in order to characterize variation in properties of biological membranes within this suborder of fishes. I also sought to determine whether notothenioids possess the capacity for acclimation to elevated temperature by determining the extent of compensation of membrane properties in several tissues (cardiac ventricles, brain, gill). Findings from this work provide novel insight into how notothenioids are likely to fare within a warmer climate. An interspecific comparative analysis was performed between notothenioids that exhibit variation in thermal tolerance (Chapters 2, 3). Membrane fluidity and composition were measured in several brain (synaptic, myelin, mitochondria) and cardiac (mitochondria) membranes from the red blooded (more thermotolerant) Notothenia coriiceps and the white-blooded Chaenocephalus aceratus. Synaptic membranes and cardiac mitochondria were more fluid in the icefish, compared to the red-blooded species. Hyperfluidization of membranes, particularly in the less thermotolerant species, C. aceratus, is consistent with the failure of the nervous and cardiovascular systems upon acute warming. Additionally, properties of membranes from N. coriiceps were analyzed following several weeks of acclimation to 0 °C or 5 °C (Chapters 4, 5). In Chapter 4, fluidity was compared between thermal treatment groups in brain (synaptic membranes, myelin, mitochondria) and cardiac (mitochondria, microsomes) membranes. Biochemical analyses of membrane composition were performed on select membranes. Results suggest evidence of homeoviscous adaptation in the cardiac, but not brain, membranes. Both cardiac mitochondria and microsomes displayed reduced fluidity following acclimation to 5 °C, indicating full thermal compensation when the membrane fluidity is compared at the animal’s respective acclimation temperature. In Chapter 5, fluidity, composition, and osmotic permeability were compared between thermal treatment groups in plasma membranes from gill epithelia. Results provide evidence for membrane remodeling, consistent with the observed preservation of membrane fluidity upon acclimation. Further, measurements of osmotic uptake in gill epithelia suggest membrane permeability is reduced during acclimation to 5 °C, possibly to compensate for the effects of higher temperatures that would otherwise render the membrane more permeable. For cardiac and branchial membranes, differences in fluidity were achieved by modulation of membrane cholesterol contents and/or fatty acyl chain length. Taken together, these results provide evidence for thermal plasticity of membrane properties in the cardiac and branchial systems of this species. The lack of a homeoviscous response and membrane restructuring in the brain would appear to limit the capacity for thermal acclimation in N. coriiceps. In total, these data indicate that the nervous system is likely to be the most susceptible to failure with increased warming in the Southern Ocean.

T1  - Does Thermotolerance in <em>Daphnia</em> Depend on the Mitochondrial Function?
AN  - 2456891300
AB  - Thermotolerance limit in aquatic organism is set by the ability to sustain aerobic scope to sudden temperature shifts. This study tested the genetic and plastic differences in thermotolerance of Daphnia that can be explained by the differences in the ability to retain mitochondrial integrity at high temperatures. Five genotypes with different biogeographic origins were acclimated to 18°C and 25°C. We developed a rhodamine 123 in-vivo assay to measure mitochondrial membrane potential and observed higher fluorescent in heat damaged tissues as the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Significant effects on temperature tolerance were observed with CCCP and DNP but not with NaN3. Effects of toxins were significant in temperature sensitive genotype and high concentration of lactate was observed in 18°C acclimated genotype only. We conclude that genetic and physiological differences are intricately linked to the ability of sustaining aerobic respiration at high temperatures which sets limit to the thermotolerance.

T1  - High Omega-6 Diet Produces a Painful Peripheral Neuropathy that Is Rescued by Altering Membrane Lipid Content or Enzyme Activity
AN  - 2449295059
AB  - The management of chronic pain remains a substantial medical problem, in part because of an incomplete understanding of the physiologic mechanisms responsible for the transition from acute to chronic pain. Moreover, current analgesics are often limited by incomplete efficacy, unacceptable side effects or risk of dependency. Currently, physicians recommend dietary interventions for the management of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and many autoimmune diseases; however, there is a large gap in knowledge on the role of diet as a risk factor or potential intervention for chronic pain. Multiple groups have demonstrated that endogenous oxidized metabolites of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids lead to increased activation of transient receptor potential channels in nociceptive neurons. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential fatty acids, so tissue levels are regulated by dietary intake; however, whether dietary omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids modulate pain has not been fully explored. The current study characterized nociceptive responses, sensory neuron signaling, histological, lipidomic, biochemical and transcriptional changes after an eight-week high omega-6 diet. The study also identified two novel approaches to potentially attenuate or reverse chronic pain. Mice were placed on isocaloric diets with high (10%) or low (0.5% with 9.5% saturated fats from coconut oil) omega-6 content for eight weeks. Thermal and mechanical withdrawal thresholds were measured at baseline and for twenty-four weeks on the diet. Isolated skin-nerve fiber recordings were used to assess changes in spontaneous and evoked responses, while immunohistochemistry was used to assess alterations in epidermal innervation and neuronal damage. The responses to thermal, mechanical, cold and light touch stimuli progressively increased after eight weeks on the high omega-6 diet. In an ex vivo skin nerve preparation, increased spontaneous nerve firing and evoked mechanical and thermal responses were observed after the high omega-6 diet compared with the low omega-6 diet. Decreased epidermal innervation in the paw and increased Activating Transcription Factor 3 expression in the dorsal root ganglion together with the behavior and neurophysiologic hypersensitivity indicated the development of a normo-glycemic diet-induced neuropathy. Multiple approaches were taken to rescue the diet-induced phenotype, including blocking the release of newly incorporated membrane lipids, antagonizing lipid oxidation and channel activation, as well as reversing diet after the initial eight weeks. Lipid release was targeted by inhibiting a sensory-neuron-specific subtype of phospholipase A2 subtype, phospholipase A2 group 7, which completely reversed thermal and mechanical nociception. The thermal hyperalgesia, but not mechanical allodynia was reduced by intraplantar hindpaw injections of compounds that targeted lipid oxidation and transient receptor channel activation pathways. After 8 weeks on the high omega-6 diet (10%), switching to the low omega-6 diet (0.5%) partially recovered the phenotype, while switching to a diet low in omega-6 (0.5%) and high in omega-3 (9.5%) polyunsaturated fatty acids rescued the phenotype and restored cutaneous innervation density. Ribonucleic acid sequencing revealed that the high omega-3 diet restored fifty percent of the dorsal root ganglion transcripts that were changed after high omega-6 diet. The primary pathways restored after high omga-3 diet were related to axonal regeneration, myelination, extracellular matrix and lipid regulation. Finally, we observed that after eight weeks on the high omega-6 diet, the duration of thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in an inflammatory pain model more than tripled compared to the low omega-6 diet animals. This persistent nociception after inflammation was not seen in mice that were switched to the high omega-3 diet. Collectively, these novel data suggest chronic dietary increase of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids leads to the development of a painful peripheral neuropathy and acts as a risk factor for persistent pain. Dietary reduction of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids partially rescued the phenotype, while switching to a high omega-3 diet led to complete reversal. In addition, preventing the release of the omega-6 lipids from cell membranes through inhibition of a sensory neuron specific subgroup of phospholipase A2 completely attenuated the nociceptive response. These findings provide a possible etiology of many neuropathy cases, while also elucidating approaches for effective treatment. The similarities between omega-6 diet-induced neuropathy and other neuropathies indicate that the targets and pathways discovered may provide a new line of therapeutic options and preventative approaches to treat multiple chronic pain conditions.

T1  - Analysis of Volatile Biomarkers from <em>in Vitro</em> Cell Cultures and Exhaled Breath for Ventilator-associated Pneumonia Diagnosis
AN  - 2411078666
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most prevalent nosocomial infections in intensive care units. The current diagnostic methodology consists of culture enrichment, and selective and differential plating methods which are limited in terms of accuracy and speed. Furthermore, the specimen used for these processes is invasively obtained. Consequently, this contributes towards increased morbidity and mortality, antibiotic resistance, and financial burden. Exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are postulated as a suitable diagnostic alternative which would eliminate the aforementioned disadvantages. These VOCs originate from exogenous, endogenous, and microbial sources. Of clinical interest are endogenous and microbial VOCs. This is because the former can potentially provide information on the metabolic state of individuals, whilst the latter may help with pathogen distinction. Thus several investigations were conducted to elucidate these metabolites. To elucidate VOCs of microbial origin, a range of in vitro studies were conducted utilising a combination of headspace, thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and statistical analysis. Firstly, commonly implicated VAP pathogens (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus) were cultured separately for discriminating VOCs. Unique VOCs for each bacterium incorporating both previously reported (indole for E. coli, 1-undecene for P. aeruginosa) and novel VOCs (1-hexanol, cyclopentanone) were observed to distinguish these bacterial species. Secondly, a study to investigate the potential to differentiate between mono- and co-cultures was conducted and yielded unique VOCs (2-methylbutyl acetate and methyl 2-methylbutyrate) in the latter and may potentially translate to distinction between mono- and poly-microbial infections. Thirdly, a simple model using A549 epithelial cells and P. aeruginosa to mimic the potential interaction of bacteria and the epithelial lining of the airways was also explored to elucidate discriminatory VOCs (tert-butyl ethyl ether and methyl tert-butyl ether). Furthermore, an aspect of the host immune response was mimicked by culturing A549 epithelial cells with hydrogen peroxide, an oxidant produced during neutrophilic response. An increase in alkane-based VOCs was observed. A clinical study (Breath: Dx) exploring the potential of VAP diagnosis through exhaled breath VOC measurement was on-going in parallel to these experiments. Before participant recruitment began, method development was performed: different sorbents were tested using a VOC standard mixture and 'pooled' breath from healthy volunteers. Breakthrough volume experiments were also conducted to ascertain the sampling volume. Tenax GR was the sorbent choice and a sampling volume of 1200 mL to be used. Early findings from the Breath: Dx study are also reported. Jointly, the research reported in this thesis demonstrates the potential for VOCs to be utilised in the diagnosis of VAP and beyond.

T1  - Community Genetic and Environmental Effects in Extremely Plastic Aquatic and Terrestrial Arthropods
AN  - 2410075545
AB  - Half of my MPhil used a parasitoid-host system (Pea aphid & A. ervi) to understand the complex interactions, created by community genetic (CG) effects and other ecological factors, that drive evolutionary dynamics. We designed an experiment that sought to understand how intraguild predation (IGP) and indirect ecological effects (IEEs) (aphid symbiosis with protective symbiont) affect the outcome of an established indirect genetic effect (IGE). We established a quantitative genetic half sibling design in the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi to understand the genotype specific effects on the phenotype of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) in the presence and absence of an intraguild predator (Chrysoperla carnea). This work aims to improve the integration of CGs into biological pest and disease control schemes in agro-ecosystems, where pest species are becoming resistant to the conventional chemical control methods and an improved understanding of the wider environmental impacts of chemical controls render them increasingly unsuitable.The experiment utilised two clonal populations of pea aphid, the established lab clone N116 and a local isolate named the 'Quad' clone, that we established from a female we sampled from our university quad. We did this to try and understand the effect of their different secondary symbionts, identified using 16s rRNA sequencing, on the outcome of the interaction between the parasitoid and host. Moreover, we wanted to try and understand the differences in wasp virulence that we found in our aphid clones.Our analysis showed that the main predictor of wasp virulence was the immunity factor in our aphid clones and that aphid behaviour was significantly influenced by a sire effect and an interspecific IGE (IIGE) effect depending on the context of the interaction. We also identified several secondary symbionts in our aphid clones, most notably the presence of three known defensive symbionts, Hamiltonella defensa, Fukatsuia symbiotica and Serratia symbiotica, in the N116 clone and the presence of Serratia symbiotica in the Quad aphid clone.The other half of my work, with Daphnia magna, sought to explain how changes to the abiotic factors of aquatic environments effect the various behavioural and developmental plastic responses of this keystone species; an understudied area considering the scale of natural and anthropogenic changes faced by ecosystems all around the globe. The types of stress faced by aquatic organisms are multifaceted, the salinization, acidification, light and chemical pollution and increases in temperature now represent real threats to biodiversity across the globe. Moreover, whilst we have a good understanding of the consequences of these when they occur in isolation, we do not yet fully understand the ramifications of the more complex and realistic scenario of these stressors occurring together. The ability of Daphnia to survive and reproduce, long term, in environments exposed to increases in salinity and acidity was tested in conjunction with exposure to constant light (e.g. light pollution) and constant darkness (e.g. eutrophic environments with low light incidence).A laboratory raised clonal population of Daphnia magna was exposed to various combinations of these stressors over 30 days to investigate the impact they had on the life history traits of our populations. After 10 days under 24-hour light, and combinations of other stressors, and despite tangible increases in population size of some treatment groups, the normal reproduction of our daphnia populations was severely disrupted when compared to the controls. Moreover, after 30 days and across all treatments the reproductive success of the daphnia populations (in 24-hour light) dramatically increased, suggesting a plastic response in daphnia tolerance to the treatment conditions. However, in the absence of any light, high mortality occurred across all treatments indicating that it had a much greater negative impact than constant exposure to light. The age structure of the populations, across all combinations of stress and in the absence of a light cycle, varied significantly suggesting that the life history responses of the populations were context specific. Our findings further our understanding of the ecology of a keystone aquatic crustacean under complex abiotic environmental stress and the ability of aquatic organisms to adapt to the novel environments created by anthropogenic effects.

T1  - Interactions among Life History, Physiology, and Temperature in Zooplankton
AN  - 2392503002
AB  - Life history traits determine the growth, reproduction, and persistence of populations via changes in organismal fitness. How life history trait evolution and plasticity will respond to global change, specifically to increases in temperature, is an emerging area of research that involves scaling individual organismal physiology to the population level. However, changes in populations also affect species interactions at community and ecosystem levels. Integrating across these scales of biological organization reveals important connections for the generation, maintenance, and consequences of biodiversity. In this dissertation, I explored how interactions among life history, physiology, and temperature affect two dominant zooplankton groups, Daphnia and Epischura and the subsequent effects they have for population, community, and ecosystem ecology.First, I examined the evolution of life history traits and their thermal plasticity in Daphnia by taking a phylogenetic approach to separate the respective contributions of lineage-specific (phylogeny) and latitudinal (climate) constraints. The mode of evolution among life history traits varied but the thermal response in life history traits most often followed a random walk model of evolution (Brownian motion). I compared species-level to population-level data to further understand the effects of local environment. Daphnia life history traits did not exhibit a strong species-specific signal but are ecogeographically distinct, underscoring that Daphnia life history evolution should be understood at the population-level rather than the species-level.Second, I tested the ability of RNA:DNA ratios to predict juvenile and population growth rates in Daphnia. I used common gardens in the laboratory to explore the predictive power of RNA:DNA ratios to explain the variation in growth rates across temperature and resource availability gradients. I then tested for correlations between RNA:DNA ratios and ecosystem metabolism in situ. RNA:DNA ratio has limited utility as a life history proxy for Daphnia and its usefulness for capturing ecological phenomena needs further exploration.Third, I combined empirical and theoretical approaches to examine the interactions between invasive species and climate change in Lake Baikal. I collected current species assemblage and abiotic data from Chivyrkuy Bay where nonnative Daphnia longispina has established yet remained locally-contained. D. longispina potentially poses a hazard to Lake Baikal’s fragile ecosystem of endemics, particularly Epischura baikalensis, a critically threatened dominant zooplankter. I parameterized and tested several models with combinations of temperature, dispersal, and competition estimates from Lake Baikal. Temperature and dispersal currently constrain D. longispina to Chivyrkuy Bay. I then used water temperature increase projections to predict future species assemblages and critical thermal points that allow D. longispina to invade Lake Baikal’s main basin. In the next century, D. longispina will invade Lake Baikal’s main basin and, if temperature increases by 8 °C, may completely supplant E. baikalensis.Fourth, I combined molecular genetics and continuous, quantitative morphological data to reveal the evolutionary history of the Epischura (Copepoda: Calanoida), a species-depauperate lineage of conservation concern. I generated the first time-calibrated, molecular phylogeny for Epischura by sequencing three ribosomal DNA loci for the entire genus. I combined the molecular data with in-depth measurements of the mandibles of each species to aid in the placement of a recently extinct species, Epischura massachusettsensis. Epischura is a paraphyletic group; the North American species diverged from the Eastern Siberian species around the late-Miocene cooling events. I proposed the resurrection of Epischurella (Smirnov 1936) to describe the Eastern Siberian copepod species.

T1  - Ecological Responses to Multiple Stressors in Headwater Streams
AN  - 2384807113
AB  - Multiple stressors are changing the ecology of many ecosystems at an accelerated rate. Quantifying and understanding how stressors, natural and anthropogenic, interact to affect the ecology of freshwater ecosystems is an important research focus. Multiple underlying mechanisms can contribute to observed patterns; therefore, identifying the relative strengths of different mechanistic pathways is necessary for effective management actions. Comparatively few studies have evaluated the interactive effects of multiple stressors or determined the underlying mechanisms driving those patterns, especially in freshwater ecosystems. In this dissertation, I examine the ecological responses and the underlying mechanisms driving responses to multiple stressors in headwater streams, which comprise more that 70% of the stream-channel length across the globe. My dissertation employs a combination of field surveys and laboratory experiments to improve understanding of multiple-stressor interactions in stream ecosystems. I address three research objectives: (i) to evaluate the individual and interactive effects of increased anthropogenic surface disturbance (ASD) associated with oil and natural gas development (ONGD; i.e., all infrastructure on the landscape) and the natural flow regime on stream fishes with different dispersal abilities and tolerances to disturbance (Chapter 1); (ii) to evaluate the individual and interactive effects of increased salinity and temperature on freshwater fish physiology (Chapter 2); and (iii) to evaluate the relative strength of different mechanistic pathways (i.e., habitat, water quality, and food availability) through which ASD could affect different freshwater species (Chapter 3). In Chapter 1, I use repeated-state (i.e., temporal trends in abundance) and rate (i.e., colonization and persistence) responses for populations of two stream fishes over a 7-year period across 64 sites to advance our understanding of flow-ecology relationships in a multiple-stressor framework. Overall, fish abundance, colonization, and persistence declined in association with the individual effect of low flows. The effect of ASD associated with ONGD differed between species, where the abundance of one species declined, while abundance of the other species increased with ASD. We found both synergistic and antagonistic interactions between stream flows and ASD, and in every case the effect of discharge was greatest at sites with more ASD, suggesting that ASD can exacerbate the effect of low flows. In Chapter 2, I combined field surveys and laboratory experiments to evaluate the interactive effects of increased salinity and temperature on the physiological responses of three freshwater fish species. I found that temperature had a greater effect on fish physiology than increased salinity. I also found that when the relationship with salinity was significant, baseline circulating hormones declined with increased salinity. This reduction in baseline hormones allowed individuals to mount a stronger response when exposed to additional stressors (i.e., facilitated stress-reactivity). I predicted that increased salinity and temperature would interact synergistically to affect the physiological responses of fishes because of temperature-dependent chemical toxicity, but I only found simple, additive and antagonistic relationships. Lastly, in Chapter 3, I evaluated the relative strength of multiple mechanistic pathways (i.e., habitat, water quality, and food availability) linking ASD to ecological responses (16 different population and assemblage responses), and found that food availability and water quality were more important mechanistic pathways underlying species responses than substrate heterogeneity, contrasting many other ecological studies. Taken together, my findings suggest that multiple, interacting stressors can affect several levels of ecological organization (i.e., individuals,populations, and assemblages) in complex ways. Therefore, it is important to determine which stressors are present, how they may interact, and at which level of ecological organization they are having the strongest effect. Through a better understanding of multiple-stressor interactions, 
managers can implement best management practices that would reduce or mitigate the negative effects of anthropogenic surface disturbance on headwater streams, helping to maintain crucial in-stream refuge habitats that promote the resistance and resilience of many sensitive species. And by understanding the specific mechanisms that underlie ecological responses and their relative contributions to ecological change, ecologists and resource managers can strengthen predictive power concerning future stressor interactions to improve management of populations, assemblages, and ecosystems.

T1  - Patterns and Processes in Tropical Forests: An Analysis of Forest Structure and Function from Long-Term Permanent Plots in Venezuela, Northern South America
AN  - 2372102084
AB  - The differential responses of trees to climate and resource gradients, coupled with historical and current disturbances affect forest dynamics and creates complex landscape patterns in forest assemblages and structures. Long-term data collected from a wide range of forest conditions provides an excellent opportunity to examine the underlying processes behind these patterns, which ultimately drive variations in species diversity, aboveground carbon stocks and forest dynamics in general. In addition, long-term data contains valuable information on the potential effects that climate change may have for terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, management policies, including conservation and restoration might be largely benefited from the results of this type of research. This study is based on long-term data collected from tree populations in different forest-types with contrasting environmental conditions in Venezuela, Northern South America. The Instituto de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo Forestal (INDEFOR) affiliated to Universidad de Los Andes in Mérida-Venezuela, maintains the longest-running monitoring plots in mature forests anywhere in Latin America and perhaps the tropics, including some sites that were established more than half a century ago. Since 2004, I have been part of four field campaigns (2004, 2009, 2012, 2016) to continue the monitoring of these sites. The information collected is now part of a larger network of similar sites under the umbrella of the Amazon Forest Inventory Network (RAINFOR project) where data has been stored and curated into the Forestplots platform to serve the global scientific community with relevant information from multiple tropical sites in Asia, Africa and South America. Three main studies compose this dissertation project, all connected through a common theme with a special focus on stem turnover, growth, productivity, and carbon cycle. This dissertation broadly tried to answer the following questions:• What are the patterns of tree turnover (i.e. recruitment and mortality) across different forest types?• What are the factors controlling Woody productivity (AGWP) across a diverse environmental gradient?• What are the relationships between turnover, productivity and aboveground biomass (AGB)?• Have turnover rates and AGWP changed over the last three to four decades?• What are the principal causal mechanisms behind the observed trends in turnover rates and AGWP?• How predictable are these processes using species functional traits?Part 1: Data from 50 long-term permanent plots from across Venezuelan forests was used to describe the patterns of stem turnover, aboveground biomass (AGB) and woody productivity (AGWP) over contrasting tropical ecological conditions, and the relationships between them and potential climatic drivers. I used a principal component analysis coupled with linear and mixed effects models to analyze the relationship between climate, forest structure and stem dynamics. Two major axes aligned with orthogonal temperature and moisture gradients effectively described more than 90% of the environmental variability in the dataset. Average turnover was 1.91 ± 0.10 % year−1 with mortality and recruitment being almost identical, and close to average rates for other mature tropical forests. Nevertheless, dynamic rates were significantly different (p < 0.001) among regions, with the lowland forests in Western alluvial plains being the most dynamic, while Guiana Shield forests are showing the lowest turnover rates. A weak positive relationship between AGB and AWGP was found with Guiana Shield forests having, on average, the highest values for both variables (204.8 ± 14.3 Mg C ha−1 and 3.27 ± 0.27 Mg C ha−1 year−1), but AGB was much more strongly and negatively related to stem turnover. Moisture was a fundamental driver of turnover, with longer dry seasons apparently favoring greater rates of tree turnover and thus lower biomass. Regional variation in AGWP among Venezuelan forests strongly reflects resource availability, with greatest AGWP when both precipitation and temperatures are high. Overall, forests in wet, low elevation sites with low turnover, stored the greatest amounts of biomass carbon. While faster dynamics are closely associated with lower carbon storage, turnover rates and woody productivity were weakly correlated, indicating that stem dynamics and carbon dynamics might be decoupled from one another.Part 2: Long-term data from 44 plots was used to analyze the temporal dynamics of stem turnover (i.e. mortality and recruitment), aboveground biomass (AGB) and woody productivity (AGWP) across different ecological regions in Venezuela over the last four decades. By means of generalized additive models to analyze temporal trends and linear models to test for a significant change in slopes, I found that 21 plots had a positive slope for recruitment rates (average slope 0.02 % year−1, p < 0.001), while 32 plots showed a positive slope of mortality over time (average slope 0.02 % year−1, p < 0.001). Regardless of region, elevation, soil fertility or climate seasonality, the increase in tree mortality was highly significant (p < 0.001). A significant increase in the amount of biomass from dead trees (average AGBloss slope = 0.02 Mg C ha−1 year−2, p < 0.001) was also found combined with a modest but steady increase in AGWP (average AGWP slope = 0.02 Mg C ha−1 year−2, p < 0.001). Although a decline in AGB change was found, the magnitude was not sufficient to significantly affect the forest carbon sink (average slope for net AGB change = −0.003 Mg C ha−1 year−2, p < 0.117). Using generalized mixed effects models, I detected that for the monitoring period of each plot, competition factors appears to be more relevant explaining observed trends in recruitment rates, while climate, particularly the steady and significant increase in mean annual temperatures was largely responsible for the increase in mortality rates. There was a clear regional effect with each driver contributing in different proportions to the observed trends in turnover, AGWP and net biomass change. The results of this study highlight the importance of including stand development and competition factors to improve our understanding of forest dynamics over time. This study can be used as an input for other more complex models aiming the analysis of effects of climate change on forest ecosystems in the tropics.Part 3: The objectives of this study were: 1) to describe the functional trait space in two contrasting tropical environmental settings in Venezuela; 2) analyze the relationships between relative growth rates (RGRs) and the average traits values for different tree species; 3) analyze the potential links between the community weighted means (CWMs) of traits with four main response variables at the community scale: rates of recruitment (r) and mortality (m), aboveground carbon (AGB) and woody productivity (AGWP). For this, I employed a principal component analysis combined with linear mixed models and data from 10 functional leaf and stem-level traits that are known to be important attributes of tree species. Additionally, four functional diversity indexes, soil nutrient content and chemistry, along with plot stem density were included into the analysis as potential predictors. I used data from long-term permanent sample plots in two contrasting mature forest sites in western Venezuela. I test the existence of a slow–fast continuum where lowland and fertile forests would be generally dominated by acquisitive traits (e.g. high Specific Leaf Area–SLA) influencing a much faster dynamics and higher productivity, while high-elevation forests can be better described in terms of conservative traits (e.g. high leaf mass per area - LMA) driving lower turnover rates and productivity but a higher AGB. Results show that both sites are noticeably different (p < 0.001) with regards to their structure, dynamics and function, with lowland forests having higher annual recruitment (2.67 ± 0.55 % year−1–Mean ± Standard deviation), mortality (3.09 ± 0.63 % year−1), and AGWP (2.95 ± 0.63 Mg C ha−1 year−1), but overall lower AGB (130.99 ± 44.71 Mg C ha−1) when compared to montane forests (r = 2.06 ± 0.26 % year−1; m = 1.59 ± 0.21 % year−1; AGWP = 2.39 ± 0.36 Mg C ha−1 year−1; AGB = 178.49 ± 27.95 Mg C ha−1). The species’ traits in montane forests were mostly associated with adaptation to high soil moisture, greater shade tolerance and thus lower growth rates (e.g. high leaf thickness, high LMA, low foliar nutrient content), whereas for lowland species, traits were more associated with higher resource availability (e.g. high SLA, high nutrient concentration in leaves). I found that different CWMs of traits have effects over different responses with CWM of leaf nitrogen simultaneously involved in all of the studied response variables. Yet, functional traits were more important when predicting AGB and AGWP compared to stem turnover highlighting the importance of other factors such as soil fertility and environmental conditions when studying stand dynamics.Venezuela is one of the most biologically diverse countries on earth. Yet, a high proportion of its ecosystems, especially forests, are threatened by deforestation and degradation that may compromise the services these areas currently provide while enhancing climate change through the emissions of carbon. The findings of this project represent a body of knowledge regarding the ecology and dynamics of different forest-types, some of which seem to be already experiencing the effects of increasing temperatures resulting in higher rates of tree mortality and a reduction in productivity. However, in some cases, these areas are not only still acting as carbon sinks mitigating the effects of climate change, but they also constitute large reservoirs of carbon and habitat for biodiversity making them highly important for a sustainable future. I strongly believe that the results presented in this dissertation project may have important connections and implications to initiatives such as reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, sustainable forest (or land) management for timber and nontimber forest products and increasing forest cover by forest landscape restoration. Each chapter in this dissertation contains information to improve decision making processes at different levels, and I see the results and conclusions of my research as important elements for a better future of Venezuelan tropical forests, its research community and overall the country.

T1  - Investigating the Response of Sea Urchin Early Developmental Stages to Multiple Stressors Related to Climate Change
AN  - 2311653028
AB  - Within climate change biology, the red sea urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus has remained relatively overlooked despite its sizeable ecological and economic importance, particularly within the context of multi-stressor effects. I assembled and described a developmental transcriptome for M. franciscanus, providing a useful molecular resource with which to study this organism. I then examined both the physiological and molecular mechanisms that underlie the response of early developmental stage (EDS) M. franciscanus to different combinations of pH levels and temperatures that represented ecologically relevant present and future ocean conditions. Elevated pCO2 levels decreased embryo body size, but at the prism embryo stage, warmer temperatures helped to offset this via an increase in body size. Warmer temperatures also slightly increased the thermal tolerance of prism stage embryos. Neither pCO2 nor temperature stressors affected prism metabolic rate as measured by rate of oxygen consumption. Gene expression patterns differed by developmental stage and by temperature exposure. Elevated temperatures led to an up-regulation of cellular stress response genes. Under colder temperatures, the embryos exhibited an up-regulation of epigenetic genes related to histone modifications. There was a comparatively minimal transcriptomic response to different pCO2 levels. Examining the physiological and molecular responses of EDS M. franciscanus to multiple stressors provided much needed information regarding a species of significant ecological and economic value by examining its capacity to respond to stressors related to climate change and ocean acidification under an ecologically relevant context.I also investigated the role of transgenerational plasticity (TGP), in which the environmental conditions experienced by parents affect progeny phenotypes. TGP may provide a valuable mechanism by which organisms can keep pace with relatively rapid environmental change. Adult S. purpuratus were conditioned to two divergent, but ecologically relevant pH levels and temperatures throughout gametogenesis. The adults were spawned and crossed, and their progeny were raised under different pH levels to determine if maternal conditioning impacted the response of the progeny to low pH stress. I investigated maternal provisioning, a mechanism of TGP, by measuring the size, total protein content, and total lipid content of the eggs that they produced. Acclimatization of the adult urchins to simulated upwelling conditions (combined low pH, low temperature) appeared to increase maternal provisioning of lipids to the eggs but did not affect egg size or protein content. I also investigated the physiology and gene expression of progeny responding to low pH stress, which were affected more by maternal conditioning than by offspring pH treatment. Maternal conditioning to simulated upwelling resulted in larger offspring body sizes. Additionally, I found the progeny expressed differential regulatory patterns of genes related to epigenetic modifications, ion transport, metabolic processes and ATP production. This work showed that adult exposure to upwelling conditions can improve the resilience of EDS progeny to low pH levels.

T1  - Tradeoffs of Juvenile Steelhead (<em>Oncorhynchus Mykiss</em>) Rearing in an Intermittently Closed Estuary, Northern California USA
AN  - 2306548527
AB  - Estuarine environments provide an essential habitat to many aquatic animals and, in some settings, can be susceptible to drastic environmental transformations caused by deviations in connectivity with the ocean. In these intermittently closed estuaries (ICEs), the presence or absence of a barrier beach, naturally controlled by wave action and river flow, determines the mouth state (closed or open). Depending on the frequency and duration of closures and reopenings, ICEs can create a conundrum for inhabitants, especially diadromous fish that must transit between marine and freshwater habitats to reproduce. Changes in connectivity to the ocean not only obstructs migration between the ocean and the river but can also cause deadly conditions, especially for juvenile pacific salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) that have a narrow range of physiological tolerances for the abiotic variables susceptible to large fluctuations in ICEs. Despite these hurdles, ICEs constitute essential habitats for threatened populations of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss). This dissertation utilizes a threatened population of juvenile steelhead in the Russian River estuary, northern California, USA as a case study to examine an array of relevant topics about the efficacy of a juvenile anadromous fish occupying an ICE. The intersection of a threatened fish with a plastic and complex life history within an understudied system provides many challenges as well as opportunities. In addition to a brief introduction (Chapter 1) and conclusion (Chapter 6), the main chapters of this dissertation (Chapters 2-5) will address knowledge gaps specific to juvenile steelhead in the Russian River estuary.The second chapter addressed uncertainties regarding what abiotic conditions juvenile steelhead are exposed to and how steelhead may avoid physiologically stressful conditions. Specifically, we answered the following questions: (1) “What are the WQ habitats used by juvenile steelhead during open and closed conditions in an ICE?” and (2) “What behavioural change is evidenced between open and closed conditions that might alter the juvenile steelhead’s risk of exposure to stressful WQ?” To answer these questions, we combined thermal sensor encoded acoustic telemetry and coincidental WQ sampling. Chapter two determined that, under open conditions, juvenile steelhead experienced primarily brackish and saline water in the lower and middle reaches and warm freshwater in the upper reach, whereas under closed conditions, they moved greater distances and were found to be aggregating near cool water refugia not used during open mouth conditions. These findings shed light on the abiotic conditions juvenile steelhead are exposed to and emphasize the importance of tributary hydrogeomorphic processes and groundwater linkages in subwatersheds that are sources of cool water refugia in ICEs.The purpose of the third chapter was to evaluate the vertical response of juvenile steelhead to the physiochemical conditions (i.e., temperature, DO, salinity) in the Russian River estuary. This chapter further explored the acoustic telemetry and simultaneously collected WQ data from chapter two to test the following hypotheses: (i) juvenile steelhead will shift their position in the water column based on prevailing physiochemical conditions; (ii) the degree to which juvenile steelhead adjust their position in the water column will vary with fish size; and (iii) smaller juvenile steelhead will risk potentially stressful conditions to take advantage of prey sources. The results indicated the depth of fish varied in response to the present abiotic conditions and typically reflected the occupation of more energetically and physiologically beneficial habitats, with smaller fish being shallower in the water column when proximate salinities are higher. Results indicated management activities that promote open mouth conditions may create challenges for steelhead that are not acclimated to saline conditions but reveal foraging strategies used by juvenile steelhead that are not yet tolerant of higher salinities.Macroinvertebrates are fundamental to the food webs, yet their response to management activities that affect connectivity to the ocean is not well understood. The fourth chapter used systematic sampling of the benthic and epibenthic macroinvertebrates to assess factors that affect the diversity and abundance of key food web taxa. Similar to other ICEs, the macroinvertebrate assemblage of the Russian River estuary was primarily composed of taxa that can deal with the variability, either physiologically or behaviourally. Furthermore, the prominent food web taxa were abundant during both open and closed mouth conditions and were found in large aggregations in habitat only inundated during closed mouth conditions. These increased densities in the closure-inundated habitat may reflect more expansive aggregations of key food web taxa that would lead to more efficient foraging for juvenile steelhead.Although the growth rates of juvenile steelhead in ICEs have been reported near the highest in literature, leading to increased marine survival, the specific factors contributing to this growth have not been specifically evaluated. The fifth chapter incorporated observed growth rates, a diet analysis, and thermal history of juvenile steelhead into a bioenergetics model to explore factors that most influence the growth potential of juvenile steelhead. In this chapter, I confirmed that growth rates of juvenile steelhead in the Russian River estuary rival the highest in literature and are attributed to ample foraging opportunities and the ability of juvenile steelhead to thermo-regulate behaviourally in the heterogeneous abiotic environment. Higher energetic costs due to higher temperatures in the upper reach were possibly buffered by the consumption of more energy dense prey. These results indicated that growth is likely not limiting the recovery of threatened steelhead in the Russian River estuary. With many populations of salmonids imperiled near their southern range, efforts for recovery could benefit from protecting habitats in ICEs and considering the impacts of management activities to the water quality conditions.

T1  - Investigation of Antioxidant Defense Profiles and Stress Responses in Hawaiian <em>Pocillopora damicornis</em>
AN  - 2305944721
AB  - In order to improve development and refinement of molecular biomarkers for the evaluation of sub-lethal levels of stress in corals, this research provides a comprehensive characterization of baseline cycling of oxidative stress defenses in the coral Pocillopora damicornis and their responses to a natural cycle of thermally-induced bleaching. Such antioxidant enzymes are highly valuable as biomarkers for detecting stress under a wide breadth of stressors, and with global degradation of coral reefs occurring due to increasing instances of stressors implicated in oxidative stress, investigation of these biomarkers for specific tailoring towards coral health evaluations is critical. Further, through the investigation of these enzymatic responses to thermal stress, we aim to provide insight into oxidative stress responses of Pocillipora damicornis to thermal stress, which is tied to oxidative stress in corals and has become prominent, causing high levels of global coral bleaching and mortality, within the last decade. This work investigated cycling of antioxidant enzymes during coral reproductive cycles, responses of these enzymes to a thermal stress event resulting in mass coral bleaching, and whether P. damicornis preferentially shifts symbiont clade mutualisms to increase thermal tolerance following thermally-induced bleaching. Resultant from these data, this research suggests that reproduction has a significant effect on the activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase. Further, enzymatic activity assays demonstrated significant increases in catalase activity with relation to heat-induced coral bleaching, although all other enzymes experienced no significant activity shifts. Finally, findings analyzing the potential for P. damicornis to shift symbiont clade assemblages from pre- to post-bleaching cycles suggests that this coral species favors conserving existing mutualisms. Such conclusions aid the molecular coral biology community through refining existing tools for detecting and characterizing sub-lethal stress levels in corals.

T1  - Lipid Biomarkers of Bering and Chukchi Sea Euphausiids and Their Application to Diet History
AN  - 2305944688
AB  - In the eastern Bering Sea, Thysanoessa raschii are the most abundant krill species and a keystone trophic member that serve as both an important grazer and link to upper level consumers. In this system krill experience large annual variation in food resources, especially during ice advance and retreat; multiple lipid classes are used to temper the effects of those fluctuations, as well as to fuel reproduction and growth. Two shipboard feeding experiments that occurred during late spring and early summer of 2010, respectively, monitored the lipid retention in adult T. raschii and examined the fluctuation of specific lipid biomarkers under food-limited conditions. Retention of neutral and polar lipid hydrolysis products (e.g. sterols, hydrocarbons, and fatty acids) and bulk lipid classes were followed over the 19- and 31-day experiments using gas chromatography with various detectors and Iatroscan techniques, respectively. One potential marker for consumption of sediment detritus was also tracked in water column particles, surface sediment, and tissue of other crustaceans in both the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Finally, glycerophospholipids (GPL), as well as di- and triacylglycerols (referred to here as di- and triglycerides; DG and TG), were followed using tandem liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MSn) to gain detailed information about detailed fatty acid stereochemistry in the lipid subclasses. Polar lipids as phospholipids comprised the dominant lipid class of euphausiids throughout both experiments. Losses were seen in phospholipids, which appear to function in both structural integrity and for energy storage. Major sterols including cholest-5-en-3β-ol (cholesterol), 24-methylcholest-5,22-dien-3β-ol (brassicasterol), and cholest-5,24-dien-3β-ol (desmosterol) comprised 98-99% of total sterol abundances in T. raschii with little variation during the experimental incubations, but small concentrations of the dinoflagellate derived sterol cholesta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol, and a novel C28:8 fatty acid, generally found in dinoflagellates and prymnesiophytes, indicated predation on smaller algae in summer by T. raschii in those periods when diatom abundances were low. Steroidal hydrocarbons (i.e. sterenes) were detected in sediments and known benthic-dwelling detritivores, but absent from water column particles. Additionally, detection of these detrital products in the neritic krill species T. raschii suggests detrital feeding as a mechanism for their winter survival.  Among intact molecules, fatty acids were largely represented by six structures – C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1, C20:5, C22:6 – with most present as mixed acyl groups within each intact lipid class.  Across the combinations of fatty acids within the intact lipids, most contained mixed moieties as fatty acids with differing degrees of unsaturation which has implications for temperature tolerance and buoyancy of animals as they adapt to varied and changing environmental conditions.

T1  - Terrestrial Paleoclimate of the Cenozoic: Insights from and Developments of the Soil Carbonate Clumped Isotope Thermometer
AN  - 2303838586
AB  - Land temperature at the surface of the Earth is a first-order parameter used to describe climate, but reliable and widespread measurements of this basic parameter through geologic time has eluded geochemists and geologists for decades. The carbonate clumped isotope geothermometer, which uses the bond-ordering of the carbon and oxygen isotopes in a carbonate mineral, is a relatively new tool that can be used to measure surface temperature on geologic timescales. Chapter 1 introduces carbonate clumped isotope geochemistry. In the subsequent four research chapters, this thesis first refines fundamental methodologies, then improves our understanding of the proxy-system by examining modern soil carbonates, and finally applies the thermometer to reconstruct terrestrial paleoclimate in the early Paleogene. 
In Chapter 2, I empirically create a clumped isotope-temperature relationship that can be used to estimate the growth temperature of natural carbonates. I rule out the two primary hypotheses that were proposed to explain discrepancies between existing ∆47 -temperature calibrations: 1) synthesis methods caused kinetic isotope effects in calibration samples, and/or 2) the temperature of the acid which was used to digest the calcite for analysis created an analytical artifact. I precipitated >56 synthetic calcite samples at known temperatures, replicating the methodologies used by previously published discrepant calibrations. I analyzed the samples by digesting the calcite at both 90 °C and 25 °C.  My results showed that the temperature-∆47 relationship does not vary with precipitation method or acid digestion temperature. Instead, I suggest that the previously observed variations in empirical calibrations were largely due to poor sample replication and small number statistics. I also show the importance of using appropriate constants in the calculation of ∆47 to correct for the¬ mass interference between 13C and 17O during mass spectrometry (as described in companion paper, Schauer, Kelson et al., 2016). Through this research, I produced a new and robust empirical calibration that can be used to calculate growth temperatures from natural calcite materials. 
Chapter 3 investigates the seasonal bias in soil carbonates by re-examining in aggregate the published ∆47 -temperature data from >200 Holocene soil carbonate samples. In this synthesis, I re-calculate and update ∆47¬ values to reflect modern standards in methodology. The updated data confirm the general assumption that most soil carbonates have a ∆47 temperature that is warm-season biased. However, importantly, I show that modern soil carbonates have ∆47-temperatures that differ from mean annual air temperatures by -5 to 24 °C. The variation in the magnitude of seasonal bias can be partially explained by differences in the annual timing of rain/snow, the texture of the host soil matrix, and vegetative cover. This variation in seasonal bias has profound implications for using soil carbonate ∆47 in paleoclimate applications and underscores the need for a process-based understanding of soil carbonate formation. 
Chapter 4 builds an understanding of soil carbonate formation that is based in soil physics and chemistry by numerically predicting the timing of calcite growth in a 1D soil profile. Using a software package called HYDRUS-1D (Šimůnek et al., 2009), I calculate soil water content, soil temperatures, soil CO2 productions and concentrations, and carbonate chemistry. I show that the timing of large rain events controls the timing of carbonate accumulation in a soil profile. During storms, soil respiration increases, which increases soil CO2 and dissolves soil carbonate. The subsequent re-precipitation of soil carbonate as soil CO2 decreases post-storm makes up the majority of the total preserved soil carbonate.  This result undermines the existing assumption that soil carbonates form slowly during evaporation during dry periods. I show that soil texture and the timing and character of rainfall will control the seasonal bias recorded by soil carbonates. This process-based understanding of soil carbonate formation will enable more nuanced and accurate interpretations of paleo-temperatures and meteoric waters. 
Chapter 5 uses the clumped isotope composition of fossilized soil carbonates collected in the Tornillo Basin of Big Bend National Park, Texas (30°N) to investigate the greenhouse climate of the Paleocene and early Eocene. I first use a combination of textural evidence and thermal modeling to identify that the isotopic signatures of the soil carbonates collected reflect primary environmental signals. The clumped isotope temperature record derived from these carbonates show an increase from 25 ± 4 to 32 ± 2 °C from the Paleocene to the Eocene, respectively, and a corresponding increase in calculated 18O of soil waters. These temperatures are lower than the temperatures predicted by global circulation models given the high pCO2 conditions and the subtropical location; they are also similar to modern summer temperatures.  These results may suggest habitable, near-coast environments persisted even during the peak-CO2 conditions of the early Cenozoic. 
In conclusion, this thesis expands the ability to reconstruct terrestrial paleoclimates with carbonate clumped isotope thermometry and highlights future challenges. Applications of clumped isotope thermometry are no longer limited by analytical precision in most settings. Instead, robust paleoclimate reconstructions hinge upon accurate characterizations of the seasonal bias of the proxy and diagenetic alteration. A more complete understanding of the evolution of Cenozoic climate on land awaits further analyses from stratigraphic sections that are spatially diverse and temporally overlapping.

T1  - In Hot Water: Thermal Acclimation Is Insufficient to Save Corals in the Anthropocene
AN  - 2303837494
AB  - Scleractinian corals are animal partners in exquisite symbioses with a suite of algal, microbial, fungal and viral associates comprising miniature ecosystems collectively referred to as a holobiont.  In recent decades, ocean warming has jeopardized the delicate balance of the very symbioses that have enabled coral survival.  Thermal stress causes a reduction of algal symbionts, a phenomenon referred to as ‘coral bleaching’ that represents dysbiosis in the holobiont and often leads to mortality.  Current thermal acclimation theory states variation and gradual increases in temperature can ameliorate thermal stress.  Indeed, there is evidence some coral species have some capacity to acclimatize to thermally variable environments, increased temperature, or both, leading to enhanced thermal tolerance.  However, disadvantages to thermal plasticity have been identified for several coral species, suggesting acclimation may not always be beneficial.  In order to better understand coral thermal acclimation, this dissertation investigated the short-term acclimatization potential of two foundational reef species to natural thermal variability, compared thermal performance with acute and cumulative exposures in the absence of acclimation, and explored the potential of corals to acquire thermal tolerance.  The studies presented here put the thermal stress response in a dose context to enable cross-experiment comparisons.  Corals under gradual stress showed physiological plasticity on the part of the animal, but any benefits appeared to be limited by the algal partner.  Acquired thermal tolerance may reduce bleaching in the short term, but whether acquired tolerance can increase recovery from bleaching requires investigation.  Further, no signs of acclimatization to thermal microhabitat variability were detected in a seven-month period, and any small benefits of repeated thermal stress appeared to be short-lived.  Hence, despite the adherence of coral respiration to the standing theory, there is overwhelming evidence that thermal acclimation, acclimatization and acquired thermal tolerance are insufficient to enable coral survival in the coming century.  The majority of Scleractinian corals will not survive the pace of climate change, dictating the dire need for the restoration of the global carbon balance and other substantial human interventions.

T1  - Thermal Acclimation and Adaptation of Key Phytoplankton Groups and Interactions with Other Global Change Variables
AN  - 2301892752
AB  - Several functional groups of marine phytoplankton groups play especially critical roles in global primary productivity, carbon export and biogeochemistry. In particular, diatoms substantially contribute to primary production, carbon sequestration and the food web. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria are equally important as a source of new nitrogen (N) through nitrogen fixation. The relationship between environmental forcing and these key marine phytoplankton groups needs more attention, especially in the context of future global change.Elevated atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) are bringing about ocean acidification and giving rise to sea surface warming. By the end of this century, atmospheric CO2 concentration is predicted to rise from current levels of ~415 parts per million (ppm) to 800-1150 ppm, while average surface seawater temperatures will increase by 2-4°C. Global warming will also result in indirect changes, such as intensified stratification of seawater, increased temperature variability and decreased nutrient inputs from the interior of oceans. Phytoplankton communities in the euphotic zone will be forced to accommodate to all of these concurrent climate change trends.The three research chapters of this dissertation aim to increase our understanding of the possible responses of marine diatoms and diazotrophic cyanobacteria to this changing ocean environment. The first project investigated the physiological responses of the widespread centric diatom Coscinodiscus sp. to interactions between elevated CO2, warming, and nitrogen availability. The growth and physiology of Coscinodiscus were found to be regulated by both individual and interactive effects of these three variables. Growth stimulation by warming was coupled with a decreased growth affinity for nitrate, indicating increased vulnerability to nitrate-limitation. Rising CO2 promoted carbon fixation rates, which may provide a negative feedback to increasing atmospheric CO2. Cellular phosphorus (P) and silicon (Si) contents declined and consequently N: P and C: Si ratios were elevated at high temperature, especially at ambient CO2 level. Moreover, numerous mutual interactions among the three climate change variables were observed for growth rates, carbon fixation rates, cellular Chl a content and elemental stoichiometry, suggesting that more attention should be paid to the overall effects of multiple climate change variables rather than only to their independent impacts.The second chapter examined how short-term thermal variability affected the growth and physiology of Trichodesmium erythraeum GBRTRLI101 in two seasons (winter / summer), as well as the interaction between temperature variation and phosphate availability. P limitation played a bigger role in stressing the growth of Trichodesmium than temperature variability. The responses of Trichodesmium to thermal variability varied with the seasonal temperature regimes and ambient nutrient availability. In particular, thermal variability significantly decreased the growth and nitrogen and carbon fixation rates of Trichodesmium cells under P-replete conditions in wintertime. Increases in cellular phosphorus use efficiencies of Trichodesmium were observed at high temperature, suggested a lower P requirement in the future warming ocean. This chapter incidentally illustrated that a nonlinear averaging model commonly used to predict growth rates under fluctuating temperatures is not appropriate to apply to nutrient-limited cells. Future warming and greater thermal variability could significantly interact with projected reduced P supplies, and thus impact the growth and physiology of marine diazotrophic cyanobacteria.The third chapter explored the short-term physiological responses and potential for evolutionary adaptation of Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 and Crocosphaera WH0005 after long-term exposure to different temperatures. Long-term thermally-selected Trichodesmium IMS101 showed a quick re-acclimation to temperature shifts from 20-34°C, while a true thermal adaptation or possibly a much slower plastic acclimation occurred in Crocosphaera WH0005. A remarkable finding was that 32°C-selected Crocosphaera cells can survive and fix nitrogen at a normally lethal temperature of 34°C, suggesting that Crocosphaera can adaptively extend its upper thermal limit if warming occurs gradually. These distinct responses of Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera may stem from their different genetic backgrounds and lifestyles. These results provide insights into evolutionary versus plastic responses, competitive interactions, niche partitioning, and changes in new nitrogen supplies from these two keystone diazotrophs in the future tropical and subtropical ocean.The three studies in this dissertation help us to better understand the synergistic effects of multiple climate change variables on marine diatom growth, elemental stoichiometry and the silicification process. They also provide unique information on the interactions of thermal variability and nutrient limitation on the growth and physiology of an important marine diazotroph, and allow better predictions of short-term acclimation and possible evolutionary adaptation to future warming conditions in two representative nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Together, this dissertation research provides novel insights into the potential trends of marine primary productivity and biogeochemistry under future ocean global change scenarios.

T1  - Thermal Limits and Resilience of <em>Hydropsyche Oslari</em> (Banks) (Trichoptera:Hydropsychidae) in Fire-affected Upper Montane Grassland Streams
AN  - 2300629258
AB  - Temperature is a critical variable that governs growth and development of ectotherms. Thermal sensitivity is often represented in thermal performance curves as a unimodal relationship between some measure of organismal performance (i.e., growth) and a critical endpoint. Many of these performance curves are experimentally derived to reflect an ectotherm’s thermal sensitivity when exposed to a pre-selected and often constant test temperature. While the temperature exposure may be environmentally relevant, the application of constant temperature exposure is not ecologically relevant. In addition, reference to environmental temperature effects often includes arbitrary metrics such as daily average temperature, which discounts daily thermal variability and its impact on physiological processes.Large-scale and repeated disturbances such as wildfires can have dramatic effects on the thermal regime of an aquatic system. Aquatic ectotherms must cope with thermal variability as habitat temperatures are repeatedly modified by indirect fire effects that may include overland flow, flood pulses, and heavy sediment loads that alter stream morphology. In 2011, the Las Conchas wildfire burned one-third of the Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico. Streams within the Preserve were differentially affected from no-effect to channel alteration and highly variable temperature regimes seven years post-fire. This provided an opportunity to characterize in situ effects of environmental thermal regimes on performance (i.e., growth) and thermal thresholds (i.e., critical thermal maximum) of the caddisfly Hydropsyche oslari (Banks) found throughout the Preserve.In Chapter 1, my objective was to characterize the in situ effects of disturbance-related thermal regime on populations of H. oslari growth and development. From July to November 2018, larvae from populations of H. oslari were collected monthly from three study reaches selected to represent distinct thermal regimes from the Las Conchas wildfire (i.e., High, Moderate, and Low daily temperature ranges). All three reaches were affected by varying degrees of the wildfire and continue to exhibit highly variable ranges of stream temperature. Growth rates of fifth instar larvae within populations of High (0.10 mg mg-1 day-1 ± 0.02) and Moderate (0.08 mg mg-1 day-1 ± 0.02) disturbance reaches were reduced when compared to those collected from the Low disturbance study (0.19 mg mg-1 day-1 ± 0.02 ) reach having low thermal variability. Larvae from the High study reach were smaller and less developed upon entry into winter dormancy relative to other study reaches.In Chapter 2, my objective was to characterize critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in larvae from populations of H. oslari obtained during the summer (and thus adapted to summer temperatures). These populations were from study reaches reflecting daily ranges in stream temperature of 11.8°C (High), 10.8°C (Moderate), and 6.2°C (Low). In the Low study reach, H. oslari exhibited decreased upper thermal tolerance limits (34.4°C ± 0.32) compared to larvae from populations of H. oslari adapted to high daily temperature variability (35.2°C ± 0.24). Of note, the average maximum summer temperatures for all three stream reaches exceeded 20°C, a limit which is generally considered sub-lethal to coldwater aquatic biota. It stands to reason that H. oslari residing in these habitats required physiological and behavioral mechanisms to adapt to the extreme maxima and relatively rapid (less than 12 h) range in temperature fluctuations. Most likely, these larvae survive by seeking thermal refugia during the hottest periods of the day.

T1  - Evaluating Variability of Urban Land Surface Temperatures Using Drone Observations
AN  - 2300554213
AB  - Temperature represents one of the largest impairments for rivers and streams across the United States. In Wisconsin alone, over 17 miles of streams are impaired for temperature. This situation is projected to get worse as urban development and climate change accelerate thermal stress on aquatic environments. Management solutions require accurate and reliable models that represent rainfall-runoff temperature dynamics – particularly the characterization of land surface temperatures and how this translates to urban runoff. However, current models may not reflect the thermal profiles of real-world systems because they rely on in-situ equipment limited to point measurements. Limited studies have considered the variability in temperature among urban surface types, which is known to be significant, and this can be a large factor of uncertainty when parameterizing hydrologic models. This lack of spatially representative data can be met with drone and infrared camera technologies that collect spatially distributed temperatures accurate to fractions of a degree Celsius. Therefore, this study addresses this knowledge gap by using drone observations to capture land surface temperature variability and develop land surface temperature models. Results indicate surface temperature variability is extensive and influenced by numerous variables related to urban environments, and that air temperature and solar radiation are significant predictors of mean land surface temperature. Conclusions from this study hold true in both Milwaukee, WI and El Paso, TX, indicating they could also be generalizable to regions beyond these two case study locations.

T1  - Antibiotic Drug Discovery Targeting Bacterial Metabolism
AN  - 2299172921
AB  - Over the last century, the use of antibiotics has enabled many advances in modern medicine, making life as we know it possible. In recent years, however, emerging bacterial resistance to virtually all major antibiotic classes has resulted in a worldwide increase in morbidity, mortality, and financial burden associated with drug resistant infections. The antimicrobial resistance crisis presents an urgent need for new antimicrobials with distinct mechanisms of action from existing drugs. The current pharmaceutical pipeline of new antibiotics is limited due to three obstacles: a lack of understanding of resistance mechanisms, a dearth of novel mechanisms of action among new antibiotics, and drug discovery challenges unique to bacteria due to their cellular and physiological composition. My dissertation research addressed each of these challenges. The mechanisms of resistance to folate biosynthesis inhibitors in Staphylococcus aureus were explored from a genetic, biological, biochemical, and structural basis. Unexpected roles in resistance and fitness were attributed to various mutations in the sulfonamide target dihydropteroate synthase. This information currently guides the development of next-generation antifolates designed to avoid these characterized resistance strategies. In the subsequent chapter, a conditional metabolic screening approach was employed to discover inhibitors disrupting metabolic pathways related to folate biosynthesis. The testing conditions were optimized to measure the biological activity of antimetabolites, which is often masked by nutrients present in standard testing media. This screen yielded an inhibitor of cysteine synthase A in Escherichia coli, which was characterized in chapter four. Multiple experimental approaches yielded indications that the cysteine synthase A inhibitors have a false-product mechanism, resulting in a widespread impact on several key branches of metabolism beyond cysteine biosynthesis. The final research chapter describes the adaptation of the cellular thermal shift assay to explore target engagement in the Gram-negative cell system. Drug entry and accumulation are especially challenging to achieve in Gram-negative cells due to their unique dual membrane system and associated efflux machinery. This assay provided an early stage tool to quickly assess the ability of antimicrobial candidates to engage the intended target in the intact cell system and also measure efflux sensitivity. Taken together, this dissertation contributes to the fight against the antimicrobial resistance crisis from multiple angles, all within the context of bacterial metabolism which is a rich source of exciting new antibiotic targets.

T1  - Instrument and Method Development for Targeted and Untargeted Metabolomics
AN  - 2299127829
AB  - Bioanalytical chemistry for the measurement of metabolically relevant molecules provides deep insight into the organism under study in the field known as metabolomics. Mass spectrometry based metabolomics methods were developed for the study of the peculiar prokaryote Gemmata obscuriglobus, the thermal tolerance of the bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, and the study of metabolites in soil systems. Investigation of an instrumental platform aimed to improve metabolomic measurements was also conducted.A targeted quantitative metabolomic study of sterol biosynthesis in a unique prokaryotic organism was undertaken. Sterols have traditionally been considered unique to eukaryotic life, with the few prokaryotes found to produce sterols thought to have acquired sterol biosynthesis capability through lateral gene transfer from eukaryotes. Gemmata obscuriglobus (G. obscuriglobus) is a prokaryote that challenges this once clear distinction between eukaryotes and prokaryotes as a bacterium with several interesting eukaryotic characteristics, including sterol biosynthesis, making it a curious specimen for evolutionary study. Quantitative analysis of two sterol isomers, lanosterol and parkeol, and their biosynthetic precursor squalene, revealed evidence of a sterol based negative feedback mechanism, squalene lipotoxicity, and support of sterol essentiality in G. obscuriglobus in this collaborative study. To date, this is the first report of sterol essentiality and of a sterol feedback mechanism in a prokaryote.A mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics workflow was developed and implemented to discover biomarkers related to the thermal tolerance differences observed between high latitude and low latitude bumble bees, Bombus vosnesenskii. The head, thorax, and abdomen were sectioned and individually subjected to an untargeted metabolomics analysis to provide an overview of the small molecules throughout the body sections consistently correlated with these groups differing in their thermal tolerance. Our measurements found several sugar alcohol molecules known to be cryo-protectants to be more abundant in all body segments of the higher latitude bees than the low latitude bees, providing novel insight into the thermal tolerance of this bumble bee.Untargeted analysis of complex samples, such as metabolite extracts, requires instrumentation capable of detecting a wide array of compounds over large concentration ranges with minimal bias toward analyte mass and type to accurately portray differences between samples. Chromatographic separation coupled to mass spectrometry has proven itself as a powerful tool for such analyses. The two major instrumental platforms used in metabolomics are liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS); however, they are not without limitations. The nature of the ionization interface between LC and MS makes it susceptible to ion suppression and poor sensitivity for nonpolar compounds. On the other hand, the gas phase separation of gas chromatography requires analytes to have sufficient volatility and thermal stability, limiting the molecular mass of metabolites than can be analyzed, and requiring chemical derivatization of polar molecules in each sample prior to analysis, providing a potential for the formation of problematic artefacts for some species. It has long been recognized that efficient interfacing of liquid chromatography (LC) to mass spectrometry (MS) via electron ionization (EI) embodies the best attributes of each existing instrumental platform and combines them into one system. An LC-EI-MS system was constructed and evaluated.The distribution and diversity of microbes in the environment is a challenging area of study that has historically been limited to focused geographical locations for targeted investigations. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies and data processing have expanded the realm of ecological hypothesis that can be probed, as well as enabling large scale studies aimed at generating new hypotheses. Through collaborative efforts among expert researchers of several different fields, including biology, chemistry, ecology, geology, botany, and bioinformatics, the Microbial Ecology Collaborative (MEC) project at the University of Wyoming aims to study microbes and their effects (consequences) on ecosystems throughout the state of Wyoming. Untargeted metabolomics with mass spectrometry aims to uncover the functional aspects of these microbes in the environment (i.e., what are they doing, eating, etc.). Preliminary soil metabolomics methodology was developed, and data is presented for the differential analysis of metabolites in Wyoming soils.

T1  - Diversification and Local Adaptation in Western Fence Lizards, <em>Sceloporus occidentalis</em>
AN  - 2288064950
AB  - I am fascinated by intraspecific variation–by both its sources and its potential implications for how organisms interact with their environments. The importance of intraspecific variation for predicting species responses to climate change has recently become a research priority. Differences in the sources of intraspecific variation–genetic divergence, phenotypic plasticity, and drift–can have profoundly different outcomes for species responses. Variation in traits produced by heritable differences in genes will be sensitive to future selection, while variation produced by phenotypic plasticity may be buffered. Time and again, mechanistic studies of species responses have highlighted the importance of considering trait variation to predict idiosyncratic responses, and the sources of trait variation must also be considered.I studied intraspecific variation in Western Fence Lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) at three spatial scales and three levels of organization. In Chapter 1 I investigated species-wide phylogeographic patterns and demographic scenarios throughout western North America. In Chapter 2 I characterized clinal variation in genotypes and phenotypes and gene flow along an elevation gradient in Yosemite National Park. In Chapter 3 I disentangled the genetic and plastic constituents of divergent phenotypes in a lab rearing experiment. My dissertation research provides an integrative framework for studying local adaptation in a polymorphic and well-established vertebrate system.Chapter 1 is the culmination of over two decades of research on phylogeographic structure within S. occidentalis. We sampled 108 individuals from 83 localities throughout the range in western North America. We used 4,555 SNPs from ddRADseq to characterize population structure and estimate demographic history. We found five genetically distinct populations including: one in the southwest, south of the Transverse Ranges; two west of the Sierra Nevada-Cascades cordillera, separated from north-to-south just north of San Francisco Bay; and two east of the Sierra Nevada-Cascades cordillera, separated from east-to-west in the Great Basin desert. The branching pattern of populations suggests that populations south of the Transverse Ranges and west of the Sierra Nevada-Cascades cordillera are divergent from populations east of the Sierra Nevada-Cascades cordillera. The predominant mechanism of population divergence is allopatric divergence and contemporary secondary contact, which supports Quaternary glacial cycles as drivers of intraspecific genetic divergence.Chapter 2 builds on foundational work by Leaché et al. (2010) to characterize genetic and phenotypic clines along an elevation gradient in Yosemite National Park. At high elevations lizards are larger and more melanistic, while at low elevations lizards are smaller and lighter-colored. We sampled 78 individuals from a 21 km stretch of the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne River in northern Yosemite. The elevation gradient spanned 1321 m from N Hetch Hetchy Reservoir (37.9168 °N, 119.6595 °W, 1167 m) in the west to E Glen Aulin (37.9076 °N, 119.4196 °W, 2488 m) in the east. We used 721 SNPs from ddRADseq to characterize genetic clines and estimate demographic history of populations along the elevation gradient. We found evidence for additional population structure and genetic divergence between phenotypically divergent individuals; one genetically distinct population corresponds to low elevation individuals and another corresponds to high elevation individuals. Analyses of SNPs, maximum size (snout-vent length, SVL), and coloration (ventral patch area) confirm that genes and phenotypes vary clinally, and not discretely, along the elevation gradient. Genetically distinct populations diverged in allopatry, but contemporary gene flow between populations is asymmetric. Genes flow uphill, with five times as many migrants entering the high elevation population from low elevation than the converse.Chapter 3 delves into the underlying sources of trait divergence between low and high elevation individuals from the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne River elevation gradient. While low and high elevation lizards mature at the same age, high elevation lizards are larger and more melanistic than low elevation lizards. We disentangled the genetic and environmental constituents of phenotypic variation by rearing hatchling lizards under controlled lab conditions. We collected five gravid females from low elevation (N Hetch Hetchy Reservoir [37.96 °N, -119.78 °W, ca. 1200 m]) and eight gravid females from high elevation (Glen Aulin [37.91 °N, -119.42 °W, ca. 2400 m]), who produced 36 and 51 hatchling lizards, respectively. We evenly distributed hatchlings from both populations among two treatments that varied in potential activity time: short activity period (6 hrs) and long activity period (12 hrs). We varied activity time by limiting access to heat-lamp-produced thermal gradients, which are necessary for thermoregulation. We found evidence that differences in size are genetically-based; high elevation hatchlings were larger than low elevation hatchlings, regardless of treatment. We found evidence that differences in color are at least partially produced by phenotypic plasticity; high elevation hatchlings were capable of plastically lightening to a color that was lighter than low elevation hatchlings. We found evidence that differences in behavior are genetically-based; high elevation hatchlings spent more time engaged in active behaviors. Overall, our findings are suggestive of local adaptation of high elevation hatchlings to restricted activity periods at high elevation.

T1  - Climate Change and a Little Brown Lizard: The Impact of Climate on Maternal Thermoregulation, Offspring Phenotype, and Host-parasite Interactions in the Viviparous European Common Lizard (<em>Zootoca vivipara</em>)
AN  - 2281943305
AB  - Climate change is predicted to severely impact species distributions and extinction risk in the coming decades. Ectotherms, such as lizards, are of particular concern due to their dependence on environmental temperatures to survive and reproduce. The predictions of extreme weather events and increases in global mean temperatures will affect the ability of these organisms to carry out important functions such as feeding or breeding. While we predict that these organisms will face challenges from climate change, examining whether they show evidence of coping with these changes is critical for determining extinction risk and making conservation decisions. In this dissertation, I use treatments of 3-hour (short), 6-hour (mid/control), and 9-hour (long) access to basking heat to investigate how different climate extremes, predicted to increase and worsen under climate change, would impact various aspects of pregnant viviparous European common lizards (Zootoca vivipara). The 3-hour treatments reflect an unusually long series of cool days limiting thermoregulation, 6-hours reflects the “normal” period of contemporary climate and 9-hours reflects periods of long-duration heat spells.In Chapter 1, I look at the flexibility of females to modify their behavior to different basking treatments and how intraspecific variation between populations plays a role. My results demonstrate these lizards exhibit plasticity in basking behavior in response to varying thermal opportunity. However, the magnitude to which they modify their behavior is significantly tempered by environmental characteristics of their population of origin. In Chapter 2, I investigate how basking treatments influence gestation and offspring phenotype, as the offspring life history stage is one of great importance. We found that offspring phenotype was significantly affected by mother basking treatments with local population differences and sex-dependent outcomes on size and viability in juveniles. My findings indicate that cooler and warmer temperatures have different effects on progeny phenotype and may have cascading impacts under climate change in the next generation. In Chapter 3, I examine how parasite load varies between populations and whether basking treatments influence a lizard’s ability to fight infection. The basking treatments influenced changes in parasite load in three of the five populations, where we observed a relatively small increase in parasite abundance in lizards in the short and mid/control basking treatment compared to the long treatment. This difference between populations suggests a context-dependent impact of basking opportunities on the capability of lizards to clear parasite infections, under the warm environment treatment (9-h) and provides further evidence that ectothermic host-blood parasite relationships are likely to be impacted by future and contemporary climate change.The results of this dissertation ultimately highlight the complex impacts climate change can have on these organisms and will hopefully encourage further research while raising awareness of this pressing issue.

T1  - The Effects of Beach and Species Management Actions on the Nesting and Incubation Environment of Sea Turtles in the Northern Gulf of Mexico
AN  - 2270072401
AB  - Sandy beaches are unique environments which offer billions of dollars’ worth of ecosystem services, including among others: storm protection, sediment storage and transport, habitat space for beach-dwelling and nesting species, nutrient cycling, and tourism. Management of coastal systems tends to be anthropocentric–adjusting the coastal environment to suit the needs of human development and use. However, management actions can have important consequences for the natural functioning of these systems, particularly on the species who live or breed on sandy beaches. It is crucial that future management actions balance the economic, aesthetic, and recreational value of these ecosystems to coastal communities and their ecosystem services. Sea turtles offer an excellent case study in this balance. Changes to nesting or incubation conditions from anthropogenic alterations (e.g., artificial lighting, beach renourishment, marine debris) can result in the abandonment of nesting, suffocation or drowning of the embryos, increased feminization or hyperthermia, or death from exhaustion, desiccation, or predation. Understanding how the nesting and incubation environment may change under different beach or species management actions is critical to ensuring their appropriate use in sea turtle population recovery.This dissertation investigated how two management actions affect the nesting and reproductive output of sea turtles: 1) sea turtle nest relocation (Chapter 2) including the assessment of inundation risk (Chapters 3 and 4) and 2) Leave No Trace ordinances (Chapter 5). Nest relocation is a common approach used to reduce losses due to inundation, erosion, poaching, and other terrestrial threats; however, there are concerns that this strategy may alter the incubating environment of the developing embryos, and thus affect proper hatchling development and fitness. In Chapter 2, I examined potential differences in inundation exposure, sand temperature, moisture content, and grain size between paired original-relocated nest sites as well as hatchling production between in situ and relocated nests. The incubating environment between original-relocated pairs were comparable, though relocation offered a minimal net benefit as it decreased emergence success and did not reduce the likelihood of inundation. More nests were being moved than are necessary, indicating additional information is needed to identify high-risk nesting sites.To better identify nests at-risk of wave exposure which are suitable for relocation, a wave runup model was developed using historical beach elevation, offshore wave, and tide data (Chapter 3). Wave runup modeling proved effective at identifying washed over nesting sites (83%). The best choice of beach slope used in the assessment varied depending on whether the user was interested in presence of wash-over or the frequency of wave wash-over at a site. An updated digital elevation model (DEM) was not necessary as the time-averaged DEM performed better than, or comparable to, those using the most recent LiDAR survey. A more complete understanding of sea turtle embryonic tolerance to inundation would improve high-risk site identification.HOBO U20L-04 water level loggers were tested in situ to evaluate their potential to provide this inundation tolerance information versus existing PVC-based equipment at paired experimental sites and when deployed adjacent to nests (Chapter 4). The HOBO loggers could provide high resolution observations of inundation frequency, duration, and severity which can inform nest productivity; however, their high cost will limit the scale of their deployment. In a complementary role, the low-cost PVC-based design can be mass-produced and deployed across a wide spatial scale but at a reduced data resolution–the balance between the use of these equipment will depend on the resources of the monitoring agency and the specific research question.Sea turtle population recovery is predicated not just on our ability to reduce losses of developing embryos, but on the continued availability of suitable nesting habitat itself. Leave No Trace ordinances are increasingly being used to combat the issue of marine debris including abandoned beach equipment (Chapter 5). Nesting success and obstructed crawl frequency were compared before and after the implementation of the ordinance at control and treatment beach segments in a BACIPS design. The ordinances had mixed success–though obstructed crawls did decline after the ordinance in Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, the presence of an obstruction did not influence a turtle’s decision to nest and nesting success declined after the ordinance across the study area due to natural variation. More time and/or increased compliance may be necessary for improvements in nesting success to materialize.These management actions appeared to have only small effects on sea turtle hatchling production and population growth rates in the northern Gulf of Mexico. But as charismatic megafauna and valuable ecosystem service providers, their continued conservation based on the provision of suitable environmental conditions serves as an important example of the need to balance anthropocentric coastal zone management with ecosystem function.

T1  - Prenatal Stress As a Potential Adaptive Modulator of Offspring Survival, Phenotype, and Performance in Response to Elevated Temperatures
AN  - 2246444761
AB  - Climate change is increasing global water temperatures, and by altering temperatures, is subsequently impacting aquatic life, particularly ectothermic fish. When mothers encounter environmental stressors such as elevated temperatures during follicular recruitment (maternal stress), resultant offspring often have altered phenotypes. Recent studies suggest that this maternal stress signal may prepare offspring for a similarly stressful environment (environmental match). I applied the environmental match hypothesis to investigate whether a maternal stress signal can prepare offspring to cope in a stressful environment. Specifically, I exposed Lake Ontario Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eggs to a biologically relevant maternal stress signal (1000ng/mL cortisol or control). We split and reared these dosed groups at temperatures indicative of current and future temperature conditions (+3°C). Then we investigated the interactive effects of thermal and maternal stress on offspring early survival, early morphology, and thermal tolerance (i.e., CTMax and energetic responses to temperature spikes). Overall I found that rearing temperature was an overriding modulator of offspring phenotype and performance. Offspring raised in elevated temperatures had lower early survival, were smaller and had a higher acute tolerance. Prenatal cortisol did not definitively modulate offspring phenotype or performance under elevated rearing temperatures. My thesis provides evidence for the role of predictive adaptive responses, as offspring who were reared in elevated temperatures had higher thermal tolerance at parr stage. Applying the environmental context of intergenerational plastic mechanism such as maternal stress remains imperative as the world continues to rapidly change under the effects of human-mediated climate change.

T1  - Lengthening Life: Diapause Induced Lifespan Extension in <i> Drosophila melanogaster</i>
AN  - 2218552854
AB  - Diapause is a protective trait used by many invertebrates to overcome unfavorable environmental conditions, such as cold  temperature and starvation.  Drosophila melanogaster undergoes a shallow reproductive diapause, characterized by metabolic reprogramming, reduced locomotion, increased stress tolerance, and delayed tissue senescence, ultimately, resulting in an increase in overall organism lifespan. Several pathways implicated in longevity also regulate diapause. This, along with the prevention of normal degeneration seen during this process, offers a unique way in which to study aging and its associated degenerative diseases. Most studies of this complex trait have utilized the pause of ovary development at pre-vitellogenic stages as the main determinant for categorizing diapause inducibility. This approach ignores the complexity of this trait by only relying on reproductive development as the defining characteristic. In this study, the power of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel is implemented in order to conduct a genome-wide association study of diapause traits. By quantifying two phenotypes, fecundity and longevity, this tool has led to the identification of a total of 151 genes associated with this trait, and 52 intergenic regions, which may be involved in the regulation of the diapause program. Enrichment analyses suggest the involvement of metabolic pathways, the innate immune system, and GPCR signaling, components of which have also been shown in C. elegans. Further studies should aim to better combine the two mechanisms of quantifying this phenotype, and functionally confirm the involvement of the candidate genes.

T1  - Contemporary Adaptive Shifts in the Physiology and Life History of Pumpkinseed <i>(Lepomis gibbosus)</i> Introduced into a Warm Climate
AN  - 2197596530
AB  - Contemporary evolution has the potential to help limit the biological impact of rapidly changing climates, however it remains unclear whether wild populations can respond quickly enough for such adaptations to be effective. In this thesis, I used the introduction of native North American Pumpkinseed  (Lepomis gibbosus) into the milder climate of Europe over 140 years ago, as a 'natural' experiment to test for contemporary evolution to a change in climate in wild populations. In 2008, four outdoor pond colonies were established in central Ontario using adult Pumpkinseed from two native Canadian populations, and two non-native populations from northeastern Spain. By raising native and non-native Pumpkinseed within a common environment, this design minimized the impact of phenotypic plasticity on differential trait expression, and allowed me to interpret differences in the phenotype among pond-reared Pumpkinseed as evidence of genetic differences among populations. I demonstrated that Canadian and Spanish Pumpkinseed have similar thermal physiology except when acclimated to seasonally warm temperatures; trait differences are consistent with Spanish Pumpkinseed being better adapted to a warmer climate. Populations also had similar overwintering ecology, however some differences, such as higher survival under starvation conditions and greater energetic benefits associated with winter feeding, indicated that Canadian populations are better adapted to harsh winter conditions typical of the native range. Finally, I determined that the relatively fast life history expressed in wild European Pumpkinseed is largely driven by plastic responses to the local environment; however, the higher reproductive investment by European populations has a genetic basis. Most climate change research considers taxa that are expected to be negatively impacted by warming: my research demonstrates that even warm-tolerant taxa that are unlikely to experience strong climatic selective forces can respond to a warming environment through evolutionary changes. The potential for adaptive contemporary evolution in warm-tolerant taxa should be taken into account when predicting future ecosystem effects of climate change, and when planning management strategies for species introduced into novel climates.

T1  - The Potential for Biological Control of the Invasive Asian Longhorned Beetle with Native North American Parasitoids
AN  - 2439347929
AB  - The invasive Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky), is a destructive xylophagous forest pest species originating from Asia. First discovered in New York in 1996, breeding populations have since spread to several U.S. states, and are also found in Canada and Europe. Currently, control of ALB is focused on its eradication; however, the rapid detection and removal of infested host trees is complicated by the cryptic nature of the wood boring larvae. Moreover, the removal and treatment of both infested and at-risk trees has led to tremendous ecological and economic impacts in infested regions. More sustainable options for the management of invasive ALB populations are greatly needed; therefore, my dissertation research focused on exploration for mortality factors of ALB in its endemic China as well as the potential for a new-association biological control approach using native North American parasitoids. Mortality factors affecting ALB eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults infesting Populus and Salix were investigated in several Chinese provinces. Results revealed that ALB density and mortality caused by various abiotic and biotic factors varied between host tree species as well as among different years and regions in China. Overall ALB density was the highest in Jilin province, and in Gansu province nearly four times the density of live larvae and pupae were found infesting Populus compared to Salix. In a survey across all provinces, ALB eggs were the life stage that was most susceptible to mortality factors, with the majority of eggs dying from undetermined factors, followed by parasitoids, and lastly from being removed by woodpeckers or other unknown predators. Larval and pupal stages were least susceptible to mortality factors throughout China, and the majority of those that died were either removed by woodpeckers or taken by unknown predators. We recovered the parasitoids Dastarcus helophoroides (Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Bothrideridae) and Scleroderma guani Xiao et Wu (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) from a small number of larvae and pupae in Gansu province and Beijing City. While foreign exploration has not resulted in the discovery of any host-specific co-evolved biocontrol agents, exploration for native North American natural enemies has revealed several native parasitoid taxa that can form new associations with ALB under laboratory conditions. One of the native parasitoid species, Ontsira mellipes Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), has been continually reared on ALB larvae at the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Beneficial Insects Introduction Research Unit (USDA-ARS BIIRU) since 2010, and may be useful as a new-association biocontrol agent against ALB. Currently, little is known about this North American parasitoid species; therefore, several laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate its life history, thermal tolerances, host preference, and potential to adapt to ALB through continuous laboratory rearing.Life history studies indicated that adult O. mellipes parasitized approximately 21% of beetle larvae presented to them throughout their life, and that host paralysis occurred 1 – 2 d after oviposition. Adult female parasitoids produced around 26 offspring throughout their lifetime. Females that were provided access to a host, honey, and water survived 9 d longer, on average, then females denied access to these resources. Egg to adult development was completed in around 3 wk, during which larvae developed through five instars before pupating and emerging as adults. Thermal studies were carried out to determine the effect of temperature on immature development, phenology, and adult reproduction and survival. Development time from egg to pupa significantly decreased from 26.7 to 6.1 d as temperature increased from 10 to 30°C, and no pupae eclosed as adults at 10°C. Furthermore, increasing temperature from 15 to 30°C significantly decreased pupa to adult emergence from 39.7 to 12.2 d. Based on the linear regression equations obtained from immature development stages, we estimate a single generation of O. mellipes requires 342.9 degree days accumulated above a lower development threshold temperature of 11.1°C. Results of the lower developmental threshold and degree-day requirements for O. mellipes obtained from linear regression models were then combined with temperature data from ALB infested areas in the U.S. to estimate the phenology of this parasitoid. This reveled that nearly 1.2 to 3.7 generations per year may occur in ALB infested areas. Adults parasitoids attacked (parasitized) host larvae across all the tested temperatures; however, parasitism reached a maximum at 25°C. Additionally, increasing temperatures significantly reduced the pre-oviposition period and longevity of female O. mellipes. Host preference studies using ALB-reared parasitoids revealed that the most abundantly and frequently collected native cerambycid naturally infesting red maple trees, Neoclytus acuminatus ssp. acuminatus, is most likely not a host of O. mellipes as no larvae were parasitized during no-choice testing, while 70.4% of ALB larvae were parasitized. Laboratory adaptation experiments revealed that host attack rates (% parasitism) increased from 46.9% to 65.7% between the F1-2 to F68-71 generations of parasitoids reared on ALB, indicating a marginally significant increase in host attack rates by later generation parasitoids (F41-43, F68-71). Additionally, later generation parasitoids produced significantly more progeny, on average, than did early generation females (F1-2).The overall results of the laboratory studies indicate that the artificial selection process acting through current laboratory rearing conditions has enhanced this candidate biocontrol agent’s ability to attack and reproduce on ALB, and further demonstrates the potential of using O. mellipes as a new-association agent of the invasive ALB. While investigations in China did not reveal any co-evolved and host specific naturally enemies, we suggest that future investigation should examine the causal agents of mortality in the field that is currently categorized as undetermined.

T1  - Climate Change Effects on Thermal Tolerance Plasticity and Population Dynamics in the Eelgrass Sea Hare, <em>Phyllaplysia taylori</em>
AN  - 2436913742
AB  - Understanding how climate change affects the physiology and population dynamics of grazers that can reduce epiphyte growth on seagrass is important for predicting the future dynamics of seagrass ecosystems. Seagrass habitats provide a number of important ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, nutrient mitigation, sedimentation and erosion control, and providing nursery habitat for fishes and invertebrates. Climate change threatens seagrass communities as increased temperature promotes photosynthesis-inhibiting epiphytic growth. Grazers have the potential to mitigate this increased epiphytic growth if their physiological performance is maintained in future climatic regimes. Phyllaplysia taylori is a grazing sea hare with two generations per year in the Zostera marina seagrass habitat along the Pacific coast of North America. It exhibits direct embryonic development with crawl-away young, greatly limiting long-distance dispersal capacity and population connectivity. In Central CA, P. taylori is a bivoltine species with non-overlapping generations that span different seasonal regimes. As a grazer species inhabiting many thermally disparate environments throughout space and time, it provides an opportunity to look at how physiological plasticity plays a role in population persistence and how this can impact the seagrass ecosystem. In my dissertation, I examined the factors that influence P. taylori’s geographic distribution at different spatial scales and variation in the plasticity of thermal physiology across life stages and among populations.In my first chapter, I documented where P. taylori populations are found along the coast and investigated the environmental and/or ecological factors that account for their distribution. Although temperature was expected to be a major driver of population persistence, this was not the case. Nutrient-rich runoff from anthropogenically-modified land was the strongest predictor of P. taylori presence, as it may contribute to epiphyte growth resulting in increased sea hare food availability. I also found that seasonal fluctuations in eelgrass density and length, epiphytic coverage, and average temperature played the biggest roles in determining relative seasonal abundance of P. taylori. The presence/absence models applied to existing restoration sites within San Francisco Bay indicated a 53% success rate for P. taylori within currently planned restoration areas. These correlation models demonstrate that it is important to consider grazer communities when planning restoration efforts.In my second chapter, I investigated the physiological differences among the populations examined in Chapter 1, testing for a relationship between phenotypes and thermal characteristics of the source habitat. To address intraspecific differences in thermal tolerance plasticity across their geographic range, thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and upper critical limits (CTmax), as well as the acclimation response of these metrics were assessed. Metabolic rate estimated by whole-organism respiration rate showed depression after acute heat stress in populations with warm thermal habitat histories. This trend was only observed in lab acclimation groups above 17ºC and indicates beneficial acclimation, whereby acclimation to warmer temperatures dampens the acute heat stress response, resulting in less energy expenditure with stress. Compared with other taxa, P. taylori had high intraspecific variation in CTmax. Short-term plasticity of CTmax with acclimation varied among collection sites, but contrary to my prediction, was not correlated with microhabitat temperature regimes. Instead, short-term plasticity elevated CTmax and its acclimation capacity well above habitat temperatures in no apparent pattern. Therefore, this study does not find sufficient evidence for positive selection acting upon the plasticity of CTmax. However, on the scale of seasons within a single population, I found significant seasonal acclimatization whereby individuals collected in the summer exhibited the highest CTmax and the greatest capacity for acclimation in this trait. These data provided relevant information on season-specific phenotypes, which were investigated in the next chapter.In my third chapter, I used laboratory acclimation temperature treatments to induce seasonally-relevant phenotypes. Within these temperature treatments, I investigated how shifts in transgenerational and developmental plasticity impacted offspring success. I found that seasonally-driven differences in offspring success were correlated with egg size and total maternal investment per clutch (transgenerational plasticity), with winter temperatures corresponding to larger, fewer eggs. Future summer temperatures resulted in significantly decreased total maternal investment with more investment per egg. Developmental plasticity sufficiently mitigated differences in maternal investment in the current climatic regime to result in equal numbers of successful offspring in all seasonal scenarios, but acclimation capacity and offspring success decreased with acute and chronic heat stress in mothers and offspring. Transgenerational and developmental plasticity decrease with high temperatures, suggesting that these life stages may be more susceptible and subject to selection with increased habitat temperature.These studies illustrate how the physiology of an important grazer in the eelgrass ecosystem will respond to climate change and outlines potential consequences at the population level. Although short-term plasticity sufficiently buffers adults from future climate shifts, maturation is made difficult by inadequate transgenerational and developmental plastic responses. While some populations may suffer due to increased mean and variation of habitat temperatures, responses across populations are highly variable. Therefore, in restoration efforts, selection of relevant source populations of P. taylori based on thermal physiology is highly advantageous. Understanding how the physiological plasticity of P. taylori is able to compensate for future climatic shifts is important for both eelgrass restoration and in determining how physiologically-plastic taxa cope with fluctuating environments.

T1  - Comparative Performance of <em>Crassostrea</em> Species in Portugal and Brazil: Climate Change Implications
TT  - Comparação da performance de espécies de ostra <em>Crassostrea</em> em Portugal e no Brasil no contexto de alterações climáticas
AN  - 2404602153
AB  - Oysters are a diverse group of marine bivalves that present major ecological and socio-economic importance in coastal ecosystems worldwide. However, oyster species are becoming increasingly threatened by climate change related stressors (e.g. seawater acidification, salinity shifts and temperature rise) as well as anthropogenic pollution (e.g. arsenic). Therefore, it is important to increase the baseline knowledge on the stress response capacity of different oyster species towards environmental stress, in order to help predict and manage the fate of these important biological resources in the context of global change. Hence, the aim of the present thesis was to investigate the comparative performance of different oyster species under several climate change related scenarios, and to project on the future of these species performance in light of global change. To achieve this goal, a series of laboratory based experiments were performed to simulate scenarios of seawater acidification, salinity shifts and temperature rise, as well as the combined exposure to arsenic (As), on different oyster species and life stages (embryo-larvae, juveniles and adults), followed by the assessment of embryo-larvae development, biochemical performance, and proteomic analysis. Because different regions of the globe will face different climate change insult, this study focused on the comparison of the performance of oysters species from populations currently present in temperate (C. angulata, Portugal) and sub-tropical (C. brasiliana, Brazil) ecoregions, with that of a worldwide distributed species (C. gigas), to understand how climate driven stressors may define species competitive advantages in a changing environment. Comparative performance of C. angulata and C. gigas, revealed that each stressor (seawater acidification, salinity and As exposures) induced similar stress response mechanisms in each species, although with differentiated capacities. Differences between species were more evident at the embryo-larvae stage, for which C. angulata was clearly more sensitive to changes in ambient salinity, temperature and As than C. gigas. At the juvenile life stage, differences in each species stress response signatures were revealed considering both oxidative stress response capacity and alterations at the proteome level. At this life stage, proteomic data suggested higher phenotypic plasticity of C. angulata in response to the investigated scenarios, thus likely attributing higher response capacity to seawater acidification in this species. In contrast to juveniles, adult C. angulata and C. gigas were less responsive to seawater acidification and As exposure, despite that data indicated that biomineralization capacity was impaired. As a corollary, data on juvenile and adults suggested that both C. gigas and C. angulata presented capacity to tolerate seawater acidification scenarios, despite that the stress response mechanisms involved present associated energetic and biomineralization costs that may have repercutions at the population levels. On the other hand, salinity showed to markedly influence oysters oxidative, metabolic and energetic status, with C. angulata likely presenting higher capacity to sustain osmotic stress. Hence, early development stages might represent the bottleneck that may define species competitive advantages towards one another. Comparative performance of C. brasiliana and C. gigas (Brazil), revealed that each stressor (seawater acidification and temperature) induced different stress response strategies in each species. Differences between species were more evident at the juvenile stage, for which C. gigas presented higher capacity to sustain acidification than C. brasiliana. On the contrary, C. brasiliana presented better physiological fitness and oxidative status under thermal stress than C. gigas. Adult oysters were less susceptible to tested scenarios in both species, despite presenting overall similar response patterns than juveniles. The present data suggest that C. brasiliana is more tolerant to thermal stress than C. gigas, but in turn may be more sensitive to seawater acidification. Generally, both species presented stress response mechanisms that enabled for survival towards the tested stressors, however data obtained suggests that the time of duration and the intensity of climate change related phenomena such as seawater acidification and thermal stress, will have a crucial influence on both species performance.Alternate abstract:Ostras do Género Crassostrea são representadas por um grupo diverso de espécies com elevada importância ecológica e socioeconómica em ecossistemas costeiros e estuarinos da biosfera. Contudo, o aumento da frequência de fenómenos resultantes de alterações climáticas e de poluição no meio marinho (acidificação, alterações de salinidade e aumento da temperatura, contaminação por arsénio), propicia o aumento do nível de stresse ambiental que poderá colocar em perigo a diversidade de espécies de ostra à escala global. Deste modo, o estudo dos mecanismos de tolerância a diversos stressores e capacidade de resposta de diferentes espécies de ostra, bem como o conhecimento das características ecofisiológicas de cada espécie, poderão revelar-se importantes para a gestão destes importantes recursos biológicos marinhos. Neste contexto, o objetivo desta tese visou comparar a performance de diferentes espécies de ostra quando expostas a diferentes cenários de alterações climáticas, no sentido de investigar se diferentes espécies apresentam diferentes capacidades de resposta a diferentes stressores, incluindo a presença de poluentes, e inferir no impacto que as alterações globais poderão vir a ter nessas espécies. Assim, um conjunto de ensaios laboratoriais foi efetuado para testar os efeitos da acidificação, alterações de salinidade e o aumento da temperatura, assim como o efeito combinado da exposição a arsénio, em diferentes espécies e estádios de vida de ostra (embriões, juvenis e adultos), através da análise da performance fisiológica, bioquímica e proteómica em resposta a estes stressores. O estudo focou-se na análise comparativa de espécies de ostra atualmente presentes em ecossistemas de zonas temperadas, C. angulata e C. gigas (Portugal); e subtropicais, C. brasiliana e C. gigas (Brasil). Através da análise comparativa das espécies C. angulata e C. gigas verificou-se que o desenvolvimento embrio-larvar da espécie C. angulata foi mais sensível a alterações de salinidade, temperatura e de arsénio (As) quando comparado com a espécie C. gigas. No estádio juvenil, foram também identificadas diferenças na performance de cada espécie aos efeitos da acidificação da água, tanto ao nível da resposta ao stresse oxidativo como ao nível de alterações no proteoma. Neste estádio de vida, os dados obtidos sugerem que a espécie C. angulata apresenta mecanismos que conferem maior plasticidade fenotípica em resposta a alterações do meio, que poderão conferir maior capacidade de resposta à acidificação do meio marinho. Contrariamente aos juvenis, os espécimes adultos de ambas as espécies apresentaram menor grau de resposta ao stresse oxidativo quando expostos aos mesmos stressores. Não obstante verificou-se que a capacidade de biomineralização foi potencialmente afetada nestes indivíduos quando expostos à acidificação. De um modo geral, os dados obtidos referentes aos juvenis e adultos sugerem que ambas as espécies apresentam capacidade para sobreviver à acidificação do meio aquático, embora através de mecanismos que acarretam custos energéticos assim como de capacidade de calcificação que poderão vir a ter impactos ao nível das populações. O estudo da resposta a alterações de salinidade revelou alterações relevantes ao nível metabólico, do stresse oxidativo e das reservas energéticas de espécimes adultos de C. angulata e C. gigas, sem diferenças a assinalar entre espécies. No compto geral, os dados obtidos para as espécies C. angulata e C. gigas sugerem que a fase de vida embrio-larval representa o estádio durante o qual as vantagens competitivas entre espécies são mais evidentes, sendo que durante este estádio de vida, populações da espécie C. angulata poderão vir a sofrer maiores impactos induzidos por alterações de salinidade, temperatura e contaminação por As, resultando na limitação do recrutamento de C. angulata a intervalos mais estreitos de condições abióticas. Através da análise comparativa das espécies C. brasiliana e C. gigas no Brasil, verificou-se que cada stressor (acidificação e aumento de temperatura) induziu diferentes estratégias de resposta por parte de cada espécie. As diferenças observadas foram mais evidentes nos juvenis, para os quais a espécie C. gigas apresentou melhor condição fisiológica em resposta à acidificação, enquanto a espécie C. brasiliana demonstrou melhor performance bioquímica em resposta ao aumento de temperatura. Espécimes adultos de ambos os taxa apresentaram menor susceptibilidade aos stressores testados, apesar de demonstrarem estratégias de resposta semelhantes à dos juvenis. No compto geral, verificou-se que ambas as espécies possuem mecanismos de resposta aos stressores investigados, embora os dados obtidos sugerem que a duração e intensidade dos fenómenos extremos de stresse abiótico terão uma influência fulcral na performance das espécies estudadas.

T1  - Survival at the Summits: Amphibian Responses to Thermal Extremes, Disease, and Rapid Climate Change in the High Tropical Andes
AN  - 2378886606
AB  - Understanding biological responses to climate change is a primary concern in conservation biology. Of the ecosystems being rapidly impacted by climate change, those in the high-elevation tropics are among the most poorly studied. The tropical Andean biosphere includes record elevations above 5000 meters, where extreme environmental conditions challenge many organisms. In the Cordillera Vilcanota of southern Peru, frogs including Pleurodema marmoratum and Telmatobius marmoratus have expanded their ranges to 5244 – 5400 m into habitats created by glacial recession, making them among the highest recorded amphibians on Earth. To understand how hydrologic alterations from loss of glacial meltwater and climatic fluctuations affect these amphibians, I conduct a 36-month field study of reproductive phenology and develop a method to distinguish glacial meltwater-fed ponds and precipitation-fed ponds utilizing natural variation in stable isotopes of water (18O, 2H, and d-excess). My results suggest that some ponds critical for breeding populations may have lost their connection to glacial runoff. Ongoing deglaciation may transform these ponds from permanent to ephemeral habitats, leading to the extirpation of the fully aquatic species, T. marmoratus. The 2015/2016 El Niño delayed the onset of the 2015 wet season and shortened the P. marmoratum breeding and tadpole development period in ephemeral ponds. I examine regional patterns of amphibian occupancy and prevalence of the deadly amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobaditis in unexplored high-elevation zones that were until recent decades covered by permanent ice. Next, I examine adaptive strategies that allow these two frog species to persist in the harsh high-elevation environment. Pleurodema marmoratum withstands the daily freeze-thaw cycle by utilizing a wide thermal tolerance range (from below 0ºC to CTmax > 32ºC) and I report the first evidence of frost tolerance in a tropical frog. My research compares divergent strategies allowing two anuran species to persist through disease and variable, extreme conditions in high-mountain environments, providing a better understanding of responses to and consequences of climate change for some of the world's highest life forms.

T1  - Vulnerability and adaptability of Africa's inland fisheries to climate change:An interdisciplinary approach to a multi-dimensional conservation challenge.
AN  - 2376273024
AB  - The unprecedented rate of contemporary climate warming is affecting ecosystems globally; and inland waters are predicted to be among the most vulnerable as they are already heavily exploited by humans for numerous ecosystem services. My doctoral research examined the effects of climate change on the inland fisheries of continental Africa, with a special focus on the ecological and social consequences for the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa. First, I used a trait-based climate-change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) of African freshwater fishes to document biogeographical patterns of climate change threats across the continent. By integrating species traits with projected climatic changes, I identified regions and species that are most at risk, and demonstrated that nearly 40% of African freshwater fish species are highly vulnerable to climate change. This study was also important in highlighting several cases where classic conservation approaches have overlooked species and regions of climate change concern. In the remainder of this dissertation, I focused on the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa, a region that emerged as highly threatened in the CCVA. In a suite of short-and longterm acclimation experiments, I tested the capacity of a commercially harvested species (the Nile perch, Lates niloticus), to cope with climate change stresses through physiological adjustments of their thermal tolerance limits. I acclimated Nile perch to a wide range of temperatures over various exposure times (3-days, 3-weeks, 3-months), and measured changes to upper thermal tolerance, metabolic performance, growth, and organ development among temperatures and acclimation times. I found that Nile perch showed evidence for compensation in upper thermal tolerance and metabolic rate over all exposure times, and demonstrated that temperature-induced cardiac remodelling influenced aerobic function in this species. The key findings of this work challenge long-held assumptions that tropical species have limited thermal plasticity for coping with climate change-related stressors. Finally, I investigated vulnerability and resilience of fishery-based social-ecological systems in the Lake Victoria basin. Household surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews were conducted in five villages ranging from low to high-dependence of fishing to determine how households and communities are affected by and respond to climate-mediated changes in the  fishery. I found that climate change is highly disruptive to fishery-based livelihoods, causing  social-ecological feedbacks that tend to entrench households and communities into a singular dependence on an already threatened and declining resource. However, fishers' growing awareness of these interactions can lead to adaptive actions that improve resilience to the ongoing changes in this ecosystem. Overall this thesis provides critical insight into climate change vulnerability of Africa's inland aquatic environments, and highlights several mechanisms that may underlie resilience in fish species and the human communities that rely on them.

T1  - Evaluation of Thermal Stress in Tropical Marine Organisms in the Context of Climate Warming
AN  - 2350899386
AB  - The marine environment is already registering the impacts of climate change. The current increase in global temperature since pre-industrial times is disrupting life in the oceans, from the tropics to the poles. The key impacts for marine species as warming continues include shifting home ranges and altered life histories due to the direct effects of temperature on metabolism, life cycles and behaviour of organisms. These pervasive effects on species will also have a significant impact in the goods and services provided by the ocean to human society. However, the vulnerability of tropical marine species (e.g. reef fish and non-coral invertebrates) towards ocean warming is still far from clear, not only due to the gap of knowledge on general ecology and biology of most tropical species, but also because there is a lack of integrative approaches addressing physiological and molecular thermal compensation mechanisms, as well as a lack of adequate or optimized assessment tools for tropical habitats. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to assess the vulnerability of marine species (fish, crustaceans and gastropods) from tropical reef environments to ocean warming (gradual temperature increase and heat waves), using molecular- (proteins and antioxidant enzymes), cellular (lipid peroxidation), tissue- (energy reserves), organism- (condition, critical thermal maxima) and sample population (acclimation rate, thermal safety margins, mortality) parameters to measure stress and performance. General methodologies included collecting animals from tropical shallow waters with hand nets, experimental assays testing acute and chronic thermal stress and thermal tolerance in the lab (following control and warming scenarios), periodic samplings of several tissue types and biomarker quantification (sample homogenization and posterior immunoassays, kinetic colorimetric assays and elemental analyses by isotope ratio mass spectrometry). Mathematical calculations were used for several performance parameters as well as stress indices. Multivariate (as well as multifactorial) statistical analyses were then performed for all datasets. Results revealed that chronically increased water temperatures (30˚C – 32˚C) elicited a time-dependent cellular stress response in all species tested, where chaperones and antioxidant enzymes showed the greatest fold-changes. The latter molecular responses were highly inducible in vital organs such as gills, liver and muscle, suggesting a relation to tissue function, metabolic- and oxygen diffusion rate which determine the flux of reactive oxygen species and damage potential in cells. Additionally, animals subjected to increased temperatures also showed poorer health status and decreased body condition with lower energy reserves when compared to control temperatures, although mortality levels remained unchanged. An acute exposure to increased thermal load revealed plastic upper thermal limits. However, thermal safety margins were generally low for shallow water species in reef environments, indicating a low ability to tolerate further future warming. This means that organisms will have to rely on subtidal habitats for thermal refugia as shallow water habitats (e.g. tide pools) become ecological traps where animals cannot escape heat. Overall, the results point to the importance of monitoring thermal change in the wild to provide decision makers with appropriate and detailed information to sustain conservation efforts in fragile tropical marine ecosystems.

T1  - Responses to climate change of the sea urchin (Pseudechinus sp.) and sea star (Odontaster validus) through hybridisation, local adaptations and transgenerational plasticity
AN  - 2313039346
AB  - Sea urchins (Pseudechinus sp.) may hybridise with sympatric species or induce local adaptations geographically and sea stars (Odontaster validus) may develop transgenerational plasticity (TGP) in response to climate change. Their stress responses were stidied and if they developed potential acclimation capacity against climate change. 1) Progenies of sympatric sea urchins P. huttoni and P. novazealandiae to thermal gradients (5.9 to 21.1 C) with near-future increased temperatures. Both hybrid progenies showed normal developmental rates like their native maternal counterparts. Due to the small sample sizes, this experiment was rendered as preliminary.  2) P. huttoni populations from Fiordland and Otago Shelf respond better to climate change as native or hybrid progeny. Crossed offspring of the two populations were tested against a combination of thermal gradients (5.9 to 21.1 C) and pH levels (pH 8.1 and pH 7.7). Both intra-site progenies developed better than inter-population groups, and both inter-population groups responded similar as their maternal intra-site populations. Both intra-site groups held withstand up to +3 C above the regional thermal limit, but the developmental rates decreased with acidic pH. Morphological changes were observed in total length, total width and postoral arms. 3) Offspring of sea star O. validus develop TGP against ocean warming. Adults were preconditioned at either ambient 0.5 C or experimentally 3.5 C in the laboratory a year prior to experiment. Embryos and larvae were tested for TGP against an environmentally-thermal gradient between 2.0 to 11.3 C. TGP was not clearly evidenced, with progenies responding poorly to warmer temperatures above 6 C. Progeny of warm-acclimated adults had broad thermal windows, but their normal developmental rate was poorer than those of cold-acclimated offspring. Warm-acclimated adults developed bigger eggs, but of lower quality than those of cold-acclimated adults. The short experimental acclimation period led to immature gonads prior spawning, a longer acclimation period is essential for further investigation.  These experiments demonstrate that sea urchin and sea star offspring experience stressful development against ocean warming and ocean acidification. Increased warming can affect physiological performance, development and thermal tolerance during fertilisation and early developmental stages, while decreased pH can disrupt calcifiying functions and metabolism in larvae. Extensive research is needed to understand the impacts of these responses to climate change.

T1  - The Use of Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperature for Climate Monitoring
AN  - 2239361725
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of the Earth has been continuously performed from different satellite platforms/constellations since the 1960s. The amount of radiometric information available in organisations like the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) may be compiled in Fundamental Climate Data Records (FCDRs), allowing the retrieval of climate records of geophysical variables, such as Land Surface Temperature (LST). Climate Data Records (CDRs) may then be used in a wide range of applications – such as drought monitoring or climate change studies, among others. Nevertheless, instruments onboard satellites of the same series, spanning decades of observations, may have different characteristics, which imposes a difficulty in the retrieval of LST. One of the most notable examples is the electromagnetic channels at which the earth is observed by these instruments. EUMETSAT Meteosat First Generation (MFG) – first launched in 1977 and last launched in 1997 – was designed to carry an instrument with only one channel in the thermal infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. On the other hand, Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites – first launched in 2004 and currently still in operation – were designed to cover two thermal infrared channels. Since retrievals of LST are based on information from that window of the electromagnetic spectrum, and retrieval algorithms are usually based on a split-windows (two adjacent thermal infrared windows) methodology – typically the Generalised Split Windows (GSW) – a different approach must be taken to homogenise the retrievals over a long period of time, with the aim of compiling an LST CDR. In this context, this thesis aims at developing single-channel/mono-window algorithms that can be used with information from MFG and MSG constellations of satellites. Two algorithms were developed – the Statistical Mono-Window (SMW) and the Physical Mono-Window (PMW) – and consequently two climate data records were compiled in partnership with the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) and Land Surface Analysis (LSA SAF). These CDRs are now available to download at the CM SAF website. The mentioned retrieval algorithms are sensitive to the amount of water vapor present on the atmosphere and use information from ECMWF ERA-Interim fields. However, its relatively coarse spatial resolution may lead to systematic errors in the humidity profiles with implications in LST, particularly over mountainous areas. This limitation was studied, and its implications discussed in this thesis with focus on the improvement of the LST retrievals over these high-altitude regions. Also, a discussion is provided focusing on the best process for the calibration of regression coefficients that constitute SMW and GSW. Another objective of this thesis is to use an LST CDR for an application focused on drought monitoring. The Vegetation Health Index (VHI) has been widely used for monitoring and characterising droughts. This index takes into account ecosystem features in terms of fluctuations between prescribed maxima and minima of NDVI (Vegetation Condition Index, VCI) and of Land Surface Temperature (LST; Thermal Condition Index, TCI), and is estimated as the weighted sum of these two contributions. Since there is no a priori knowledge about vegetation and temperature contributions, VHI is typically taken as the average of both contributions, i.e., a weight of 0.5 is assumed. It is shown that by maximising the correlations between VHI and the multiscalar drought indicator SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) it is possible to evaluate the relative roles of VCI and TCI for different climate regions. This application is developed over a Euro-Mediterranean region and then further applied on a global scale and over the Meteosat disk, using the LST CDR previously developed. In summary, this thesis is focused on the development, improvement and application of LST climate data records.

T1  - Ecohydrology of Natural and Restored Wetlands in a Glacial Plain
AN  - 2205581689
AB  - More than half of wetland area in the U.S. have been converted to other land use types for agricultural use and development. Limited understanding of ecological services provided to society by wetlands is another reason for the massive wetland loss in the past. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and the 1989 federal mandate of “no net wetland loss” supported increased efforts for wetland restoration and creation to compensate for two centuries of ecosystem degradation. Hydrology is a critical driver for wetland formation and sustainability, yet few studies have investigated the ecosystem benefits of restored or constructed wetlands relative to natural wetlands. Considering that unexpected ecohydrologic behaviors such as drought have been reported as a main cause of unsuccessful restoration over the U.S., understanding and quantifying water movement within the local seeing is imperative to future wetland restoration.     From an environmental engineering perspective, wetlands are regarded as complex environments controlled by regional geomorphology, atmosphere, geologic setting, and human activity. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was tasked with developing a hydrogeomorphic assessment approach for wetlands in the various regions throughout the U.S. to facilitate wetland restoration. This effort was redirected in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, but the need for assessment tools persists for several remaining regions including the southern coastlines.    The first part of the dissertation reports an investigation of impacts of geomorphic settings on hydrologic functions within the St. Lawrence River plain. Regional geomorphology links wetlands and surrounding areas by multiple pathways of water transfer such as groundwater exchange and surface water connections. However, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings, including Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County versus U.S. Army Corps-SWANCC (2001) and Rapanos versus U.S. (2006) overturned federal protection of wetlands by the Clean Water Act unless the wetlands are shown to be geographically connected with jurisdictional waters. These rulings jeopardize mitigation wetlands without federal protection because typical restoration practices often minimize surface water connection as a result of dredge-and-fill methods. Hydrologic behaviors and services of the geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) were hypothesized to be identical to those of geographically connected wetlands in this study. Experimental evidence suggest that hydrologic connectivity is maintained between GIWs and downstream waters via subsurface flow exchange. Greater correlations for GIWs than the other connectivity types were found between variables including standard deviation of groundwater, geographic attributes (e.g., site elevation) and hydrologic attributes (e.g., duration of subsurface flow reversal). Mean groundwater table depended most strongly on wetland fraction within a drainage area.     Water temperature, particularly in summer, strongly influences the environmental suitability for wetland species such as a Blanding’s turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) for nesting in northern New York. Although temperature dependency of wetland fauna has been investigated to determine the range of suitable environmental conditions, the hydrogeomorphic controls on seasonal thermal regimes of wetlands were not addressed in prior studies. In this study, temperature regimes at multiple sites under uniform climate and geologic settings were investigated to understand the controls on wetland temperature in several of hydrogeomorphic settings. Local geomorphology and alterations by wetland restoration affected wetland thermal regimes via various seasonal subsurface flow exchange patterns. Thermal sensitivity is defined as a response in surface water temperature to change in air temperature. Based on wetland temperature measurements, linear regression was used to estimate thermal sensitivity for each site. Summer temperature values were shown as primary determinants by site comparison. In addition, the thermal sensitivity values were compared to site variables to seek for local controls. Results suggest that geographical and hydrologic variables including site elevation, duration of subsurface flow reversal, and standard deviation of wetland stage and groundwater table are significantly correlated with thermal sensitivity. Geomorphic settings are useful resources to characterize site hydrology and thermal functions of wetlands. Wetland restoration practitioners need to carefully choose class-appropriate hydrogeomorphic settings to promote establishment and conservation of temperature-sensitive species.    Finally, the impact of the land surface energy budget was measured to assess the patch level controls on evapotranspiration by various wetland species. Infrared thermometry was used within a standard meteorological measurement system to determine energy partitioning between sensible and latent heat fluxes in wetlands. A portable thermal infrared (TIR) camera was used to capture radiometric surface temperature of leaves, i.e., evapotranspiring surfaces, and then to estimate sensible and thus latent heat flux associated with a portable weather station...

T1  - Forecasting in the Unseeable: A Mixed Methods Model of Planktonic and Biofilm-Bound <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> in Building Water Systems
AN  - 2201965070
AB  - Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) is an infectious disease agent of increasing concern due to its ability to cause Legionnaires' Disease (LD), a severe pneumonia, and the difficulty in controlling the bacteria's persistence in drinking water systems.   L. pneumophila thrives within the biofilm of premise plumbing systems, utilizing protozoan hosts for protection from environmental stressors and as “unicellular incubators,” which increase the bacteria's infectivity to human host cells. Typical disinfectant techniques have proven inadequate in controlling L. pneumophila in the premise plumbing system, exposing users to the potential for LD. The concentration of L. pneumophila  in the water system is challenging to predict due its persistence in the biofilm, an area that is unable to be sampled in operational water systems. As the bacteria have limited infectivity to human macrophages without replicating within a host protozoan cell, the invasion and replication of a protozoan host cell is an integral part of the bacteria's lifecycle. While there is a great deal of information regarding how L. pneumophila  interacts with protozoa, the ability to use this data in a model to attempt to predict a concentration of L. pneumophila in a water system is not known. The overall intent of this dissertation is to forecast the concentration of L. pneumophila in the water system. It describes the planktonic growth of the bacteria in the premise plumbing system of a hospital ward and details the invasion of and growth within an amoeba host cell. L. pneumophila's lifecycle is modeled under ideal conditions and under the oxidative stress of chlorination.    The persistence of L. pneumophila is modeled throughout the premise plumbing system of a mock hospital ward mimicking a realistic hot water system in a hospital. The mock premise plumbing system consists of a 60°C gas hot water heater which feeds into a trunk and branch plumbing system. The first section of the premise plumbing is a 3” insulated copper pipe 50 m in length, the second section is a 1” insulated copper pipe 50 m in length, and the third section is a 0.5” uninsulated copper pipe. The main driver for L. pneumophila persistence in the hot water premise plumbing system is temperature, and the main factor influencing temperature is the piping material. The insulated sections of pipe have low thermal conductivity (0.346 W/mK) resulting in only 2.5°C of temperature loss over 100 m. Where the uninsulated section of pipe has a higher thermal conductivity (401 W/mK) resulting in 13.23°C cooling over those three meters. The L. pneumophila decayed in the premise plumbing system while the hot water remained over 50°C, but entered the growth range when the temperature dropped below 48°C, in the last uninsulated section of the hot water plumbing. The maximum concentration of planktonic   L. pneumophila was 2990 CFU/L in the water heater and 3365 CFU/L in the hot water plumbing.   Data from the literature were used in order to model the invasion of an Acanthamoeba castellanii (A. castellanii) host cell by L. pneumophila. Monte Carlo methods were applied in order to account for uncertain variables such as maximum invasion rates. The uptake rate was modeled using a linear regression. In order to predict the effects of chlorine on the invasion of A. castellanii by L. pneumophila the letA and   flaA genes were considered. The effects of chlorine on the transcriptional regulation of each gene and the effect of silencing the gene on the uptake rate of the bacteria to an A. castellanii host were combined to predict the total uptake rate reduction under the oxidative stress of 2 mg/L of chlorine, the recommended chlorine residual. There was a maximum uptake rate of 0.97 and 2.73 x 10-4 L. pneumophila per amoeba host cell in ideal conditions and chlorination conditions, respectively. The uptake rate model was combine with the planktonic growth model showing a concentration of 19.03 - 21.42 L. pneumophila per host cell in ideal conditions and 5.36 x 10-3 - 6.04 x 10  -3 L. pneumophila per host cell in chlorination conditions, during the movement of the bulk water from the heater to the tap. This uptake model was also applied to the biofilm showing uptake rates of 6.51 x 10 -6- 3.85 x 10-2 and 1.84 x 10 -9 - 1.08 x 10-5 L. pneumophila per host cell in ideal conditions and chlorination conditions, respectively.

T1  - Fish Growth, Temperature, and Life History: Applying Theory to Improve Fisheries Research and Management
AN  - 2190686745
AB  - Ectotherm growth is inextricably linked to both temperature and other aspects of life history. In this dissertation, I leverage life history and bioenergetics theory to (1) justify and standardize the use of metrics that adequately describe the effect of temperature on ectotherm growth, and (2) develop and apply methods that leverage the links between ectotherm growth and life history to extract life history information from growth data. I focus on fishes as example ectotherms. Fish growth is driven by the amount of thermal energy accrued over time (i.e., the thermal integral). Accordingly, numerous studies have found strong linear relationships between fish growth and degree-days (DD), a thermal integral metric. Despite these findings, fish science lags behind other fields in the widespread adoption of DD, likely due to (1) a lack of theoretically-sound support for the observed linear relationships between fish growth and DD, and (2) insufficient justification for using DD derived from air temperatures in place of DD derived from water temperatures in fish science. Moreover, there is limited guidance for selecting the base temperature for growth (T0), an important parameter for calculating DD, among fishes and scenarios. In Chapter 2, I combine empirical data and simulation modeling to provide bioenergetic and limnological foundations for the linear relationship between fish growth and DD, and I show that air-based DD can serve as an accurate proxy for water-based DD for describing fish growth. In Chapter 3, I provide estimates of T0 for 82 fish species using approaches that are rooted in fish biology. Together, these analyses will help to justify and standardize the use of DD in fish science. Fish growth is also strongly correlated with other aspects of life history (e.g., maturity, mortality). Recent advances in life history theory have led to the development of biphasic growth models that allow for the estimation of age-at-maturity, reproductive investment, and other life history traits from growth data. However, these models can be difficult to fit in the absence of maturity data. In Chapter 4, I develop a statistical framework for fitting biphasic growth models using only length-at-age data. I show that this approach can provide accurate estimates of age-at-maturity and other life history traits, and I evaluate the performance of the method across various species and data quality scenarios. In Chapter 5, I use a similar approach to investigate shifts in life history traits in an ecologically and economically important fish stock (Gulf of Mexico red snapper Lutjanus campechanus) from 1941-2005. This growth-based approach allows for the estimation of life history traits deeper into the past than would have been possible using traditional approaches and provides a more holistic understanding of how red snapper life histories have shifted in the face of fishing pressure and other stressors. Taken together, this work has the potential to improve fisheries research, promote sustainable fisheries management, increase global food security, and encourage similar advances in other fields.

T1  - The Effects of Submarine Groundwater Discharge on Tropical Reef Benthic Community Composition, Structure, and Primary Productivity
AN  - 2190680732
AB  - Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is recognized as an important source of inorganic nutrients and freshwater to coastal waters worldwide. SGD has been implicated in changing benthic community structure and hypothesized to enhance primary productivity. The goal of this dissertation is to elucidate the role of SGD in structuring benthic macroalgal communities and changing overall reef productivity in a tropical ecosystem (Maunalua Bay, O’ahu, Hawai’i) by measuring a suite of variables in situ and using a variety of modeling techniques to understand when and where SGD structures benthic communities. I used benthic chamber stable isotope incubations to show that SGD increases carbon uptake of a dominant benthic alga by 82% and water column carbon uptake by 32%. The highest uptake rates occur at intermediate salinities (∼21–22), indicating that mixing of nutrient-rich groundwater stimulates the productivity of algae and plankton in specific areas of coral reefs. Using surveys of macroalgae and in situ growth experiments, I found that species-specific macroalgal biomass and growth are significantly related to both SGD and long-term integrated indices of wave and wind exposure. I also related multivariate community structure to the temporal and spatial variability in tidally modulated SGD. At SGD seeps I documented low diversity and higher biomass of benthic species that can tolerate the biogeochemistry associated with high concentrations of SGD. Reefs with SGD can be hotspots for algal restoration and for species with large tolerance ranges for temperature, salinity, and nutrients to thrive. The site differences in both the SGD biogeochemistry and community structure underlines the importance of doing these types of studies at the watershed level. Understanding the effects of SGD on coastal communities will help direct and prioritize conservation and management efforts.

T1  - Reconceptualizing Cancer: The Development of New Models and Frameworks
AN  - 2189847644
AB  - Cancer research secures an enormous amount of money each year, and researchers are generally quite productive with that money. The trend over the recent years has been for cancer biologists to focus on understanding the early stages of cancer and through a molecular and mechanistic framework. This gets translated into clinical applications through implementation of preventive and screening practices and early treatments. This work is important and has undoubtedly saved many lives. However, metastasis (the spread of cancer throughout the body) is the pathogenic aspect of cancer, and the cause of most cancer-related deaths. We have little ability to successfully treat cancers once they have reached this stage. Thus, this dissertation offers three novel models (two conceptual models and one empirical model) that facilitate the shift of attention away from the elucidation of tumor initiation and early stage cancers to the investigation of metastatic cancers.    This shift to metastatic cancers involves more than a temporal shift in the cancer progression. That is, part of my argument is that we cannot simply apply the same conceptual frameworks and methods used to study tumorigenesis but to metastatic cells. Metastasis is more complex than tumor growth, so we need different conceptual models to guide that research. This dissertation begins with a pair of conceptual models, that I argue engage with important causal factors not contained in the molecular and mechanistic frameworks used to study tumorigenesis. I then use a simple model (budding yeast,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and experimental evolution to empirically validate one of the models that suggests changes in interactions between levels of organization are causally informative in understanding the evolution of a trait (e.g., the evolution of cancer). This work explores how mitochondrial defection is involved in the evolution of tolerance to heat shock, which I use as proof of concept that one needs to consider multiple levels of organization together to understand cancer. In other words, this interdisciplinary dissertation demonstrates how context matters both in interpreting data and setting up research questions. The models I present here may help interpret existing data but also encourage novel research programs such as the empirical work presented here.

T1  - Peptide-Guided Dental Tissue Regeneration for Oral Care
AN  - 2185747656
AB  - Oral diseases are one of the most prevalent health problems that affect quality of life and well-being. These diseases include: (1) Demineralization-related dental conditions such as hypersensitivity, caries, white spot lesions; (2) Aesthetic problems e.g., tooth staining; (3) Soft tissue-related ailments that can lead to periodontitis and gingival recession; and (4) Infections and inflammations e.g., mucositis and peri-implantitis leading to implant failure. Current therapies mostly rely on replacement of the defective hard tissues with synthetic restorative materials. The implant treatment is also a common viable option in the contemporary dentistry when synthetic restorations fail and tooth extraction is indicated. The long-term success of these synthetic material-based restorations, however, is still low and questionable; indeed, they often cause post-therapeutic problems such as inflammation of gingiva or formation of secondary caries. Moreover, the failure of implants due to inflammation of the peri-implant mucosa and peri-implantitis as well as bacterial infections are major concerns. The primary reasons for the failure of current dental restoration therapies are four-fold: (i) Limited ability to reinstate the structure-function of the lost tissue, (ii) Lack of structural and functional integration (interface problem), (iii) Low thermal, mechanical, and chemical durability, and (iv) Tissue toxicity and low biocompatibility. The common denominator to overcome current limitations is to enable natural biomineralization  in situ either on the defective hard tissues or at the tissue-material interface. The ideal approach would, therefore, be biomimetically developed repair and replacement materials, and regeneration therapies that follow the lessons from biology in dental tissue formation. Although numerous traditional biomimetic restoration approaches have been developed to reproduce biological minerals and tissues, these are still far from being feasible to use as a therapeutic and technological product due to the requirement of natural full-length proteins as the key enabling therapeutic agents. As an alternative route towards eliminating the inherent disadvantage of protein-based therapies, solid binding peptides have emerged as an effective molecular tool. These peptides are isolated through combinatorial mutagenesis and further engineered using bioinformatics and computational tools to epitomize the key functions of the natural proteins. Building upon molecular biomimetic principles, the hypothesis of this research is that "Using solid binding peptides, it could be possible to remineralize and repair the dental hard tissues; e.g., dentin, enamel and cementum, and restore the structure and function of the tooth with a well-integrated and durable mineral layer that could be administered via variety of formulations such as aqueous solution, gel and lozenges."    To demonstrate the validity of the hypothesis, it is planned to focus on four task areas including;    Task-I: In vitro Peptide-guided Biomimetic Repair of Dental Hard Tissues (enamel and dentin);    Task-II: In vivo Peptide-guided Remineralization to Restore Dental Caries (animal model);    Task-III: Development of Mineralizing Peptide-based Restorative/Therapeutic Dental Care Products (dental lozenges);    Task-IV:Improving the functionality (preventing risks associated with failure) of dental implants. The successful completion of these tasks will establish the basis of the peptide-guided remineralization therapy for developing a universal solution for oral care.

T1  - Symbiosis of Scleractinian Corals in a Marginal Environment
AN  - 2178312012
AB  - Coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis is the key to the success of coral reefs. This mutualistic relationship is delicate, affected by various kinds of environmental stresses, and is under a rising threat brought about by global climate change. Hong Kong is a marginal and stressful environment for coral growth. Local scleractinian corals experience high seasonal and spatial variability in environmental factors. Yet, Hong Kong water still supports a high diversity of at least 84 scleractinian coral species. Understanding the coral symbiosis in Hong Kong would therefore provide insight on how corals cope with stressful environment.   In this study, various aspects of the coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis were examined to detect unique traits that could possibly reflect adaptive strategies employed by Hong Kong corals. The symbiont diversity in Hong Kong corals was examined using PCRDGGE analysis of ITS2 region. Six local coral species (Platygyra acuta, Porites lutea, Oulastrea crispata, Leptastrea purpurea, Lithophyllon undulatum and Goniopora lobata), hosting three different symbiont types, were then chosen for temporal monitoring of changes in their symbiont types, photophysiological parameters (symbiont density and chlorophyll contents) and symbiont cell size, for up to two years. Finally, symbiosis establishment in early developmental stages and how this would be affected by environmental stresses (temperature and salinity) were evaluated on P. acuta larvae and  Acropora valida larvae and recruits.   Of the 56 coral species investigated, five distinct ITS2 types of  Symbiodinium were detected. A clade C generalist Symbiodinium  (subclade C1) dominated most species examined (found in 55 species) while the stress-tolerant clade D Symbiodinium was found only in two coral species. Only one single symbiont type was detected in most coral species. No spatial differences in symbiont composition were detected among different regions of Hong Kong. Seasonal monitoring of six coral species also revealed temporal stability of the dominant symbiont type, despite a wide range of in situ temperature fluctuation. Comparing to literature records of symbiont diversity in global coral reefs or coral communities, Hong Kong corals host a remarkably low symbiont diversity. The predominance of a single symbiont type, Symbiodinium C1, suggests that this subclade is best acclimatized to the local fluctuating and/or low winter temperature conditions. Forming symbiosis with the best acclimatized symbiont, instead of with a diverse group of symbionts with different physiological performances, either sequentially or simultaneously, may be a strategy employed by Hong Kong corals to cope with stressful conditions.   Symbiont density was generally high in Hong Kong corals. Relatively high chlorophyll contents in P. acuta and P. lutea potentially contribute to their local dominance. Temporal variations in photophysiological parameters were detected but yearly cycle was not consistently observed. Symbiont cell size also showed temporal changes. These parameters were found to correlate with seawater temperature, solar radiation, and salinity to different extents. The response is coral-algal combination specific, highlighting the role of both symbiont and coral host in determining coral photophysiological performance in response to seasonal change, as well as possible adaptation to the local marginal environment by the holobionts.   While most Hong Kong adult corals are specific in their symbiosis, the larvae of P. acuta and both larvae and recruits of  A. valida were found to be flexible during symbiosis establishment. They were able to acquire all types of symbionts experimentally provided (C1, C15 and D8-12). Symbiosis establishment with the parental symbiont type,  Symbiodinium C1, was impaired by elevated temperature. Lowered salinity had limited effect but interactive effect between temperature and salinity was detected. On the other hand, a symbiont type (D8-12) of the ‘opportunistic’  Symbiodinium clade D, was found to result in higher infection percentages in both coral species and was not as much affected by temperature and salinity stresses as the other subclades. Clade D symbiont was reported to exhibit higher thermal tolerance, but it was also shown to be less photosynthetically efficient, leading to a lower growth rate in coral juveniles. The present study also showed no comparative advantages in settlement success and survivorship of recruits with D8-12 over C1 symbiont. The higher infection success of D8-12 symbiont could simply be due to its greater infectiousness. This implies that global warming may drive the coral recruits to form symbiosis with less favorable symbionts like clade D Symbiodinium and thus affect the growth of future generations of corals under global climate change.

T1  - Investigating the Interplay of Physiological and Molecular Mechanisms Underpinning Programmable Aspects of Heat Stress in Pigs
AN  - 2176951401
AB  - Heat stress (HS) undermines production efficiency in all animal agriculture, culminating in major economic losses annually. The effects of HS in pigs is realized through depressed growth, altered body composition, and impaired reproductive performance. Pigs, unlike other mammals, do not possess functional sweat glands, making them rely on other mechanisms to thermoregulate during a heat challenge. Continual investigation of hyperthermia in pigs is crucial for developing new strategies and/or technologies that mitigate the effects of HS imposed on the pork industry. The studies conducted in this dissertation investigate the complex interplay of whole-animal physiology as well as cellular and molecular mechanisms within specific tissues. Identifying pigs demonstrating HS tolerance without compromising productivity would be valuable. Thus, study 1 (chapter 2) was carried out to evaluate the degree to which thermoregulatory responses are associated with production phenotypes during acute HS. Hyperthermic pigs accumulate more adipose tissue than their feed intake predicts, which may be mediated by HS-induced hyperinsulinemia. However, less is known how HS influences fatty acid composition and adipocyte size, both of which are regulated by insulin and can influence carcass fat quality. To better understand the underlying physiology of how HS influences body composition, study 2 (chapter 3) investigated insulin’s potential role in affecting adipose characteristics during HS. A cardinal physiological response to HS is compromised intestinal integrity and concomitant increased gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into systemic circulation. While HS causes female infertility, many of the reproductive consequences imposed by the abiotic factor are also recapitulated by direct exposures to LPS independently. Additionally, heat shock proteins are known as molecular stress responders, but their roles during in vivo periods of stress in the ovary are ill-defined. Thus, study 3 (chapter 4) was conducted to evaluate the direct and indirect (i.e., LPS) effects of HS on ovarian heat shock protein machinery. Recent studies also demonstrate that body composition and metabolic responses to HS can also be programmed via gestational HS, directly impacting the progeny’s postnatal development. Developmental programming is mediated through specific epigenetic mechanisms and study 4 (chapter 5) investigated alterations to DNA methylation and protein responses in muscle as a result of intrauterine HS. In conclusion, the cumulative discoveries within this dissertation expands our knowledge regarding the negative consequences of thermal biology in pigs, a pivotal step for mitigating the deleterious effects of environmental HS on animal health and performance.

T1  - Heat Stress Response and Evolution of Thermal Tolerance in the Copepod <i>Tigriopus californicus</i>
AN  - 2166202246
AB  - With the warming trend due to climate change, conservation of species requires knowledge in ecological and evolutionary aspects of thermal tolerance and adaptation. In this dissertation, I use tidepool copepod, Tigriopus californicus, as a model for studying both aspects of thermal tolerance. For ecological aspect, identifying the most sensitive life stage can help us predict future responses especially in marine organisms with complex life history. I examined different survivorship to acute heat stress among life stages and across populations of T. californicus. Results revealed early life stages of T. californicus survived acute heat stress at higher temperatures than adults in contrast to popular belief. However, heat stress during larval stage of T. californicus resulted in developmental delay. Survivorship in larval and juvenile stages across populations also conform with a pattern previously observed in adults with more heat tolerant populations toward southern range of the species. In order to uncover the evolutionary basis underlying thermal tolerant in  T. californicus, I examined allele specific expression in F1 hybrid between populations from San Diego (SD) and Santa Cruz (SC). RNA sequencing revealed regulatory divergence in several gene ontology categories that potentially contribute to thermal tolerance including, electron carrier genes, genes involved in muscle and cuticle assembly, genes involved in proteolysis and Heat Shock Protein (HSP) genes. Heat Shock Protein Beta 1 (HSPB1) is one of the highest expressed HSPs in response to heat stress. HSPB1 Allelic imbalance suggested divergence in cis regulatory element underlying heat stress induced expression. HSPB1 promotor sequencing revealed polymorphisms in the Heat Shock Elements (HSEs), a binding site for Heat Shock Transcription Factor (HSF), where heat tolerant southern populations contain 2 canonical HSEs while northern populations have substitutions in the conserved motif of HSEs. Allele specific expression in more F1 crosses confirmed biased expression favoring alleles from populations with 2 canonical HSEs. Functional assays comparing recombinant SD and SC HSPB1 demonstrated that SD HSPB1 has a better capacity for preventing protein aggregation and preserving enzymatic function under high temperature. Overall, results from this dissertation provide insights on both ecological and evolutionary perspectives of thermal tolerance.

T1  - Genetic Basis of Thermal Divergence in <i>Saccharomyces </i> Species
AN  - 2164400358
AB  - The genetic architecture of phenotypic divergence is a central question in evolutionary biology. Genetic architecture is impacted by whether evolution occurs through accumulation of many small-effect or a few large-effect changes, the relative contribution of coding and cis-regulatory changes, and the prevalence of epistatic effects. Our empirical understanding of the genetic basis of evolutionary change remains incomplete, largely because reproductive barriers limit genetic analysis to those phenotypes that distinguish closely related species. In this dissertation, I use hybrid genetic analysis to examine the basis of thermal divergence between two post-zygotically isolated species,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. uvarum. S. cerevisiae is relatively heat tolerant, whereas S. uvarum is heat sensitive but outperforms S. cerevisiae at 4 degree C. Gene expression analysis with an S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum hybrid revealed a small set of 136 genes with temperature-dependent  cis-acting differences, suggesting that the temperature divergence has not caused widespread cis-regulatory divergence. Using a genome-wide non-complementation screen, I found a single nuclear-encoded gene with a modest contribution to heat tolerance, and a large effect of the species' mitochondrial DNA (mitotype). Recombinant mitotypes and allele replacements indicate multiple mitochondria-encoded genes contribute to thermal divergence, with the coding sequence of COX1 showing a moderate effect on both heat and cold tolerance. The non-complementation approach also identified allele differences of CUP2, a copper-binding transcription factor, in copper resistance of S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum. Chimeric alleles showed that multiple changes underlie the resistance of S. cerevisiae CUP2, with cis-regulatory changes having a larger effect than coding changes. Taken together, my findings suggest that evolution of interspecific phenotypic differences often involves accumulation of small-to-medium effect changes, such as those in mitochondrial DNA and CUP2, and can occur through both coding and  cis-regulatory changes.

T1  - Sex Determination and Interspecies Hybridization in Zebrafish <i> Danio rerio</i> and Pearl Danio <i>D. albolineatus</i>
AN  - 2129688355
AB  - Sustainable management of fisheries and improvement of aquaculture production depends on an increased scientific understanding of fish physiology, nutrition, genetics, and ecology. With over 33,000 described fish species, and hundreds of these species being commercially fished or farmed, it is impractical to develop scientific resources and thoroughly investigate the biology of each species. One solution to this problem is the utilization of model organisms. The zebrafish Danio rerio is a widely used model organism in the larger experimental biology community. However, several areas of research need to be addressed for its utility to increase, particularly for fisheries and aquaculture research. First, rearing methods need to be improved, with an emphasis on larval and early juvenile stages. The sex determination system is controversial, but has been suggested to be polygenic. Finally, interspecies hybridization, which is a key tool in genetic improvement for aquaculture species, has not been thoroughly explored in the Danio genus.    We present a series of studies addressing these areas of research in order to increase the utility of the zebrafish model system with an emphasis on applications to fisheries and aquaculture research. First, we designed and evaluated a rearing method utilizing a novel set of environmental parameters (3 parts per thousand salinity, high densities of live food, algal turbidity, 24L:0D photoperiod) from 5 to 21 days post-fertilization (dpf) that led to rapid growth rates (mean ± SD lengths of 19.4 ± 1.0 mm and 30.4 ± 1.5 mm at 21 and 42 dpf, respectively) and high fertility (232 ± 124 oocytes/female at 66 ± 3 dpf) (chapter 2). Next, we evaluated this protocol at temperatures close to the lower thermal limit for embryonic development (23°C) and observed no significant decrease in survival compared to a control group kept at optimum temperature (28.5°C) (chapter 3).   We then utilized this rearing protocol to perform a series of investigations into the zebrafish sex determination system. First, we produced triploid zebrafish and confirmed previous studies that found triploid zebrafish to be all male. We then treated triploid zebrafish with estradiol (100ng/L) from 5 to 28 dpf, and found that both treated and untreated triploids were all male. Untreated diploid siblings were also all male while treated diploid siblings were 11% male. This demonstrates that triploidy acts downstream of estradiol to induce male development (chapter 4).   Induced gynogenesis (inheritance of only maternal chromosomes) is a frequently used technique for investigating sex determination in fish species. Previous studies on gynogenesis in zebrafish reported inconsistent results and utilize irradiated zebrafish spermatozoa to induce embryonic development in zebrafish oocytes. This leaves open the possibility that rare, incompletely irradiated spermatozoa may cause gynogenetic progeny groups to be contaminated by biparental offspring. To address this methodological issue, we demonstrated that UV-irradiated common carp Cyprinus carpio spermatozoa activated embryonic development in zebrafish oocytes and that hybrids between zebrafish and common carp were inviable (chapter 5). We then used UV-irradiated common carp spermatozoa to induce gynogenesis in zebrafish. Out of 52 adult gynogens, only one was female. This is consistent with zebrafish having a polygenic sex determination system where inbreeding causes male development. Male gynogens and their biparental siblings were outcrossed to the same group of unrelated females. The families sired by gynogen males were more likely to be female biased than families sired by biparental males. This suggests that inbreeding induces male development through recessive and/or overdominant male-determining alleles (chapter 6).    There are no studies investigating the sex determining systems of other  Danio species, making it impossible to evaluate the evolution of sex determination in Danio. To address this gap, we investigated the sex determination system of pearl danio Danio albolineatus. We first performed a full-factorial mating and found that sex ratio varied between families from 5 to 100% male. Six breeding pairs were crossed twice and the sex ratios were not significantly different between the first and second crossings. Heritability was estimated at 0.89 (mean of posterior distribution) with a 95% credibility interval of 0.44 – 1.40. Together, these observations demonstrate that pearl danio has a polygenic sex determination system, and suggests that polygenic sex determination may be conserved between zebrafish and pearl danio. We then performed gynogenesis with pearl danio and the resulting gynogenetic families were strongly male-biased (91 ± 8% male). This suggests that inbreeding also induces male development in pearl danio (chapter 7). After observing the relationship between inbreeding and male development in zebrafish and pearl danio, we developed a hypothesis for why this may be an evolutionarily adaptive trait: male-biased sex ratios improve parental fitness under conditions of inbreeding through male-specific dispersal and investment in mate searching (chapter 8).

T1  - Ecophysiology of a Non-Native Alga: Effects of Abiotic Conditions on Invasion Success of <i>Sargassum horneri</i>
AN  - 2116772149
AB  - As anthropogenically-mediated biological invasions become more prevalent in marine systems (e.g. with burgeoning global commerce), it is increasingly essential to understand how variation of environmental factors in new habitats will influence the success of these species. The invasive marine macroalga Sargassum horneri was first observed in Long Beach Harbor, CA, USA in 2003 and has since spread throughout the Southern California Bight and along the Baja California Peninsula, MX, where it forms dense, monospecific stands on low intertidal and subtidal rocky reefs. S. horneri can exert negative effects on recipient communities, particularly through spatial preemption of native macroalgae and resulting impacts on primary production and community composition. While some studies have addressed ecological effects of adult  S. horneri, no manipulative studies of sensitive early life history stages had been performed to date. This study used (1) laboratory culture and (2) photophysiological experiments to understand how variation in abiotic conditions impacts germling and juvenile S. horneri, and thus facilitates or inhibits its spread. Treatments consisted of an orthogonally-allocated array of temperatures (10, 15, 20, or 25° C), nutrient availabilities (natural or nutrient-enriched seawater), and light levels (50 or 500 µmol photons m-2 s-1). Overall, temperature was the strongest driver of S. horneri growth. Moderate temperatures (15 and 20° C) facilitated the greatest growth and development in juveniles and germlings, while juveniles were able to survive and grow at temperatures (10 and 25° C) that inhibited germlings. However, physiological tolerance of these temperatures required additional resources, such as high light or elevated nutrients, which may not exist in natural habitats within the invasive region. The results of this study suggest that the S. horneri invasion is unlikely to expand latitudinally past known biogeographic breaks at Point Conception and Punta Eugenia under current oceanographic conditions. It is important, however, to consider changing conditions, such as increasing seawater temperature due to global climate change. These findings can aid resource managers in the identification of potentially-vulnerable recipient localities, both within Southern California Bight/Baja California ecosystem and in other regions connected with northeastern Asia through substantial transoceanic trade.

T1  - The Evolutionary Ecology of Aquatic Insect Range Limits: A Mechanistic Approach Using Thermal Tolerance
AN  - 2115858411
AB  - Understanding the effect of climate variability on species physiology and distribution is a longstanding and largely unresolved challenged in evolutionary ecology with important implications for vulnerability to climate change. My dissertation is focused on understanding the effects of temperature on physiological traits and genetic population structure of aquatic insects, to better understand the mechanisms that underlie their elevation range distributions.    For my first chapter, I tested the hypothesis proposed by Dan Janzen in 1967, that temperate mountain species should have broad thermal tolerances thus allowing them to disperse easily across elevation, unhindered by the novel temperatures they encounter. On the other hand, tropical species should exhibit narrower thermal tolerances in response to the stable climate they experience. They should be physiologically challenged to disperse and be restricted to a narrow elevation range distribution. I measured critical thermal limits (CTMAX and CTMIN) and thermal breadth (difference between CTMAX and CTMIN) in several phylogenetically related temperate (Colorado) and tropical (Ecuador) aquatic insect species. I found that, as predicted, species that encounter wider stream temperature ranges, such as temperate species and high elevation tropical species, have broader thermal breadths compared to their tropical and low elevation relatives.    Next, I tested how plastic the critical thermal maximum (CTMAX) response was in a subset of aquatic insects. Greater acclimation ability is thought to allow species to withstand the large temperature fluctuations associated with different seasons. Implicit in Janzen’s hypothesis, is the assumption that temperate species have greater acclimation ability compared to tropical species. My experiments revealed that temperate and high elevation tropical mayfly species had greater acclimation ability compared to their relatives. However, we found no differences in acclimation capacity in stoneflies. Temperature may therefore not affect all species equally, and species acclimation ability may be a result of other factors such as body shape and evolutionary history.    I then measured a third trait, metabolic rate, to investigate how it varies with temperature in temperate and tropical mayflies. Metabolic rate is arguably one of the most important traits for species because it determines the amount of energy an animal has available for its activities. I found that metabolic rates vary between temperate and tropical mayflies, and that temperatures away from a certain optimum are stressful and sometimes lethal for tropical but not temperate mayflies.    Finally, I linked thermal tolerance to dispersal by correlating gene flow among populations with pairwise differences in the physiological trait CTMAX. Analyses revealed that there was lower gene flow (higher  FST) among populations in Ecuador than among populations in Colorado. Within Ecuador, differences in CTMAX were highly correlated with maximum stream temperature, which was found to best explain tropical mayfly genetic structure. In Colorado, no environmental or physiological variable was found to explain population structure. Our results indicate, as Janzen predicted, that temperature can act as a significant barrier to dispersal among tropical populations but not in temperate ones. Thermal sensitivity measured as CTMAX was also correlated with F ST but was not significant.    As a whole, the results from my research lend support to Janzen’s hypothesis and suggest that temperature plays an important role in determining range limits of aquatic insect species through its effect of thermal tolerance traits. While this research addresses long standing questions in ecology and evolution, it also has conservation implications. Most importantly, as the effects of global climate change augment, the thermally sensitive tropical species from this study system are at particular risk for extreme population declines or even extinction.

T1  - Using Comparative Transcriptomics to Study Thermo-Osmotic Stress Tolerance in Native and Non-native Oysters
AN  - 2113571084
AB  - Oysters are ecologically and economically important coastal foundation species that regularly experience abrupt changes in temperature and salinity. In southern California, efforts to restore the native Olympia oyster ( Ostrea lurida) may be challenged by the presence of the introduced Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Using an RNA-Seq approach my aim was to characterize the molecular response to low salinity and high temperature stress in both native and non-native oysters, and to describe expression profiles of various immune, heat stress, and oxidative stress response genes. I hypothesized that acclimation to low salinity would cause significant differential gene expression from non-acclimated oysters when challenged to a thermal stress. For  O. lurida, oysters acclimated to low salinity conditions prior to thermal stress exhibited greater downregulation in select genes compared to other single stress treatments, suggesting a suppression of genes with important roles in environmental stress tolerance. This suppression may be linked to a diminished energy supply characteristic of organisms maintained at lower salinities. Gene expression analysis in C. gigas  showed the absence of differentially expressed interferons and HSP 70 suggesting overall greater thermal tolerance than  O. lurida whether acclimated or unacclimated to low salinity prior to a thermal challenge. This study adds to the molecular resources for future shellfish studies related to environmental stress and represents the first to use RNA-Seq to examine the synergistic effects of temperature and salinity in California’s native oyster.

T1  - Acclimation and Evolution in a Changing Climate: Integrating Physiology, Transcriptomics, and Genomics of a Thermal Specialist
AN  - 2101512445
AB  - Climate change is one of the top causes of biodiversity loss. Organisms will experience many pressures associated with climate change, one of the most obvious being increased temperature. It is therefore important to understand how animals will react to this stress. Ectotherms, such as ants, are especially sensitive to the climate as they rely on environmental temperature for everything from optimal foraging to development time. In this dissertation, I explore the individual and population level reactions to thermal stress of a cold-specialist, the winter ant, Prenolepis imparis. I also identify the role past climatic fluctuations have had in shaping this species’ current distribution.    In my first dissertation chapter, I conducted a RNA-seq analysis to identify stress-induced genes in P. imparis individuals at the transcriptome level. To identify candidate genes involved in the stress response, I induced stress by placing the ants at a low or high temperature. Then, I sequenced the transcriptome of these stressed individuals. The genes that show an increase during transcription are candidates for allowing individuals to recover from the stress. I identified a total of 709 differentially expressed genes. In the cold-stressed ants, I did not identify a strong response, indicating that the temperature we chose for trials was not cold enough. Conversely, I found a strong response to the heat. Those transcripts we found highly induced include protein folding genes, heat shock proteins, proteins associated with heat shock proteins, Ca2+ ion transport, and a few unknown genes. I also found functional categories relating to protein folding, muscles, and temperature stimulus increased in the heat-stress response.    In my second dissertation chapter, I measured the short-term acclimation ability of high- and low-elevation populations of P. imparis across California. In addition, I also characterized the thermal environment both above and below ground. I found that the high-elevation sites showed increased tolerance and reduced capacity in acclimation ability relative to the low-elevation counterparts at their lower limits, suggesting an evolutionary trade-off between tolerance and acclimation ability. In addition, I found less acclimation capacity across all populations in their upper limits. I also found that the high-elevation sites experience cooler temperatures both above and below ground. The greater acclimation response at lower limits in high-elevation populations could suggest that they are better physiologically prepared to survive cooler temperatures.    In my final dissertation chapter, I used phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to identify population genetic structure and historical demographic patterns across the range of P. imparis. I relate the genomic patterns to those expected as seen with in situ diversification, or maintained connectivity. I recovered five well-supported genetically isolated clades across the distribution. I also investigated gene flow between these major genetic clades and did not find evidence of gene flow between clades. High support for five major geographic lineages and lack of evidence of contemporary gene flow indicate in situ diversification across the species’ range, probably influenced by glacial cycles of the late Quaternary.    Overall, the results from this dissertation give insight into plasticity as well as the evolutionary processes that have shaped this species. My results suggest molecular pathways by which phenotypic plasticity will allow individuals to overcome heat-stress: the candidate genes provided here are a valuable resource in understanding pathways and proteins necessary for survival at unfavorable temperatures. I also report that individuals from different populations show different levels of thermal tolerance and plasticity. All the populations show less tolerance and reduced plasticity to the heat. This is troubling in the face of climate change, this limited acclimation response at the upper thermal limits suggests evolutionary constraints in heat tolerance, so major changes at the molecular level will be needed for these populations to persist in warmer environments. Finally, the entire range of this species has been profoundly affected by climatic fluctuations during the Quaternary. These fluctuations led those individuals to have separate evolutionary histories and raises the possibility that there are several unique species of  P. imparis.

T1  - Sea Change. Phytoplankton Change Too? Thermal Adaptation of the Marine Diatom <i>Thalassiosira pseudonana</i> in Response to Temperature: An Evolutionary Scenario
AN  - 2097218191
AB  - Rapid evolution in response to environmental change will likely be a driving force determining the distribution of species across the biosphere in coming decades. This is especially true of microorganisms, many of which may evolve in step with warming, including phytoplankton, the diverse photosynthetic microbes forming the foundation of most aquatic food webs. I tested the capacity of a globally important, model marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana , for rapid evolution in response to temperature. Selection at 16 and 31°C for 350 generations led to significant divergence in several temperature response traits, demonstrating local adaptation and the existence of tradeoffs associated with adaptation to different temperatures. In contrast, competitive ability for nitrogen (commonly limiting in marine systems), measured after 450 generations of temperature selection, did not diverge in a systematic way between temperatures. After 500 generations of temperature selection,  T. pseudonana populations had diverged in their thermal reaction norms for fatty acid composition and in their carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll a contents. Divergence in C:N:P stoichiometry was not apparent. 31°C-selected populations showed morphological evidence of selection for more efficient nutrient uptake at high temperatures. This study shows how rapid thermal adaptation affects important growth, nutrient uptake and utilization, and cellular physiology and morphology traits in a key marine phytoplankton species, and may thus play a role in long-term physiological, ecological and biogeographic responses to climate change.

T1  - The Role of Pik3r1 in the Regulation of Adipose Tissue Insulin Sensitivity
AN  - 2090094062
AB  - Obesity is a burgeoning health crisis in the United States. Obesity is associated with an earlier and greater risk for developing metabolic diseases. Insulin resistance is a central and defining feature of the metabolic diseases associated with obesity.    Class 1a Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is integral in canonical insulin signaling. PI3K contains regulatory (p85α/β, p55α/γ, p50α) and catalytic (p110α/β/δ) subunits. The α regulatory subunits are encoded by Pik3r1. Increased  Pik3r1 abundance has been observed in obese white adipose tissue (WAT). Furthermore, obese mice with heterozygous (HZ) knockout of  Pik3r1 remain insulin sensitive, despite marked obesity.    Taken together, it is crucial to understand the role of WAT  Pik3r1 in regulating insulin sensitivity. Recently, literature has demonstrated that standard vivarium temperature (~22 °C) is a thermal stress for mice, as their thermoneutral zone is ~30 °C. Considering mice are a preclinical model for studying metabolic disease, it is critical to understand cellular and systemic responses to high fat diet (HFD) at 22 °C and 30 °C.    To determine the role of AT Pik3r1 in regulating insulin sensitivity, mice with constitutive and inducible adipocyte specific hetero/homozygous knockout of Pik3r1 were studied following acute (three days) and chronic (12 week) HFD, respectively. Furthermore, insulin sensitivity was assessed in mice with adipocyte specific overexpression (OX) of p55. To determine the influence of short-term (8 and 12 days) thermoneutral housing on insulin sensitivity, mice were studied following one and five days of HFD at 22 °C and 30 °C (one week acclimation at 30 °C prior to starting HFD).    Visceral WAT p85α abundance was increased (2-fold) following acute HFD in wild-type mice, with a parallel increase in systemic insulin resistance. HZ knockout of adipocyte Pik3r1 prevented acute HFD induced systemic insulin resistance. Furthermore, HZ knockout of adipocyte  Pik3r1 reversed obesity induced glucose intolerance and enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity and adipocyte insulin signaling. Moreover, OX of adipocyte p55α enhanced (40%) glucose tolerance, energy expenditure (30%: light cycle; 45%: dark cycle) and markers of AT thermogenesis in brown AT. Lastly, housing temperature had a significant impact on the cellular pathways that regulate glucose metabolism in response to HFD exposure. This dissertation includes previously published co-authored material.

T1  - Invasion and High-Elevation Acclimation of the Red Imported Fire Ant (Formicidae: <i>Solenopsis invicta</i>) in the Southern Blue Ridge Escarpment Region
AN  - 2086489898
AB  - The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, is an invasive species in the United States that has rapidly spread throughout the country since its first introduction to Mobile, Alabama, in the 1930s from South America. Within the past decade, researchers have predicted elevational and latitudinal limits on S. invicta’s distribution owing to the presumed difficulty of their coping with the severity of high-elevation winters. Building on recent reports of S. invicta colonies established at elevations in excess of 1219 meters in Macon and Jackson counties, NC, I subsequently (2016–2017) documented approximately 75 live colonies in the Highlands and Cashiers areas of Macon and Jackson Counties. The presence of these invasive ants at relatively high elevations raises the question of the likelihood of their continued persistence. In this study I explored possible physiological and behavioral adaptation of S. invicta to high elevation environments through a comparison of cold and heat tolerance, fat content, and nest-site selection collected along an elevational gradient from piedmont to montane regions in the Carolinas and north Georgia (203–1228 m). For comparison, I also collected physiological temperature tolerance data for the dominant native woodland ant Aphaenogaster picea.  Solenopsis invicta occurring at higher elevations exhibited a significantly greater tolerance for cold temperature extremes as compared to lower-elevation conspecifics. This tolerance differential resembles that of the native ant  A. picea, which naturally occurs along a similar elevational gradient. Whereas S. invicta had a significantly higher tolerance for heat and a wider overall tolerance range compared to the native ant  A. picea, both species exhibited a similar downward shift in thermal tolerances when moving up the elevational gradient. There was no significant difference in colony lipid content along the gradient, suggesting that greater metabolic rates are not needed to sustain these ants through winter dormancy at high elevations. Finally, nest-site selection in proximity to a thermal mass (rocks, logs, concrete footers, etc.) does not seem to improve thermoregulation, and ants at high elevations do not appear to select nest sites based on proximity to a potential thermal buffer. The results are discussed in the context of future projections for the continued spread of S. invicta in montane and higher-latitude regions.

T1  - Genomics and Transcriptomics of Antarctic Nematodes Reveal Drivers of Life History Evolution and Genome Evolution
AN  - 2081899003
AB  - Elemental stoichiometry defines a critical understanding of the relationship between nutrient availability and usage throughout different levels of the biological community. We found there is a link between available phosphorus (P), cellular phosphorus, and nematode development as postulated by the growth rate hypothesis (GRH). I predicted that in a P-poor environment, cellular RNA concentrations would be lower than they are in P-rich environment, and thus the 18srRNA expression level will have reduced. To most efficiently regulate the uptake of limited P, I predicted that nematodes in P-poor environments would decrease the number of copies of the 18s rRNA gene in their genome. I measured life history traits as well as rRNA gene expression and gene copy number. We found that elemental stoichiometry predicts evolutionary changes consistent with the Growth Rate Hypothesis. We sequenced and assembled a draft genome of P. murrayi. Although we expected to find genes responsible for stress tolerance, we hypothesized that in response to strong selection pressure associated with living in a simplified ecosystem, over time the genome of P. murrayi should have undergone significant decay (gene loss) relative to species in ecosystems structured more strongly by biotic interactions. We found significantly fewer genes in P. murrayi . To compare patterns of gene expression between two highly divergent Antarctic nematode species, we sequenced and assembled the transcriptomes of S. lindsayae and P. murrayi.  Under laboratory conditions at 4 °C, S. lindsayae had significantly lower rates of gene expression but expressed a significantly larger number of genes.  We speculate that the differences in gene expression are correlated with life history traits (developmental rates) while the differences in the number of genes expressed can be explained by their different genetic systems (S. lindsayae is amphimictic, P. murrayi is parthenogenic) and the soil environments to which they are adapted. Since we previously showed that differences in available P content can influence the evolution of gene expression via gene copy number, and that this ultimately influences growth rate, we wondered how much of this response is driven by genetics versus how strongly these patterns are driven by temperature. To better understand this, we maintained wild type populations of P. murrayi in P-rich and P-poor conditions at 5 °C, 10 °C and 15°C in the laboratory for over 40 generations and sequenced the transcriptomes prepared from each treatment group. We found that nutrient levels played an important role in gene expression when the temperature is optimal for  P. murrayi culturing and that temperature is more important in gene expression when the available P is limited. This work underscores the utility of using principles of elemental stoichiometry coupled with genomic and transcriptomics research tools to make and test predictions about life history evolution. The results of my work also inform inferences about the ways in which nutrient availability also drives the organization of trophic interactions and ultimately ecosystems.

T1  - Escaping the Arrhenius Tyranny: Metabolic Compensation During Exposure to High Temperature in <i>Daphnia</i>?
AN  - 2073726403
AB  - Poikilothermic organisms experience trade-offs by differential physiological demands generated by temperature extremes. Many such organisms exhibit acclimatory effects, adjusting their metabolism and physiology to recently experienced temperatures. One such acclimatory effect is metabolic compensation, the deceleration of biological rates below Arrhenius expectations. Daphnia magna is eurythermal, and if acclimated to mildly stressful temperatures first, survives longer in lethal temperatures. This study examined the effect of ambient temperature (5°C–37°C) and acclimation history (lifetime at 10°C or 25°C) on the oxygen consumption rates of 8 genotypes of Daphnia with high or low acute temperature tolerance. There were decelerations of respiratory rates across a temperature gradient when acclimated to 25°C or following short 8-hour acclimation to measurement temperatures.  Daphnia exposed to a near-lethal temperature (35°C) with a 24-hour recovery period at 25°C-acclimation temperature showed no difference in respiratory control compared to unexposed 25°C-acclimated Daphnia . Genotypes showed no difference in potential compensatory ability.

T1  - Multiscale Simulations of Complex Interfacial Dynamics
AN  - 2065165413
AB  - Subsurface processes represent a class of important phenomena that occurs in many natural and anthropogenic settings. This dissertation deals with mathematical modeling of multiscale subsurface processes. Subsurface processes can be simulated at multiple scales with variable degrees of fidelity. We investigate the effect of subsurface phenomena on macroscopic dynamics in three particular cases.    In Chapter 2, we consider microscopic (pore-scale) features of reactive transport that cannot be properly resolved in macroscopic (Darcy-scale) models. While microscopic descriptors might be closer to reality, they are computationally unfeasible when deployed on a macroscale. Hybrid algorithms combine the physical fidelity of a microscopic model with the computational efficiency of its macroscopic counterpart. We develop a hybrid model of dynamic reactive fronts in an open fracture, with a chemical reaction occurring in the zone of contact between two dissolved species. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the hybrid model outperforms its microscopic and macroscopic counterparts in terms of computational time and representational accuracy, respectively.    In Chapter 3, we consider the effect of temperature on interfacial dynamics where small fluctuations affect instabilities. Viscous fingering is a hydrodynamic instability that can be caused by a viscosity difference across a traveling thermal front. We investigate the problem of displacement stability in the filtration flow for two-phase filtration in the presence of heat transfer. Fingers instability was analyzed for isothermal and non-isothermal processes. Our synergistic numerical and theoretical investigation confirms the development of instability due to differences in viscosities. Our results demonstrate that controlling the stability of such a system requires exponentially lowering the fluid’s viscosity when the temperature is increased.   Even by implementing multiple simplifying assumptions, most real-world problems are extremely complex and, therefore, quite costly to thoroughly analyze. In Chapter 4, we utilize a supporting vector regression (SVR) method to create a surrogate model, based on a limited amount of data, capable of describing the behavior of a set of wells with various input parameters. SVR is applied to analyze and to deconstruct the groundwater geochemistry observed in the regional aquifer for characterization of contaminant sources. Using synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that our SVR model is capable of accurately building a surrogate model using only a limited amount of experimental data and simulation results. Further, we demonstrate that global sensitivity analysis can be applied to our SVR model and it can produce accurate results at significantly lower computational cost.   Overall, this thesis investigates multiple aspects of multi-scale fluid dynamics by both developing physics-based numerical models and data-driven computational approaches.

T1  - From the Cradle to the Grave: How the Embryonic Environment Shapes Responses to Climate Throughout the Life Cycle
AN  - 2058103246
AB  - With rapidly warming climates, biologists are challenged to predict organismal responses to environmental variation, changes in biodiversity, and shifts in species distributions. In many cases, organismal responses differ across life stages that exhibit differences in physiological tolerances, habitat requirements, and resource allocations strategies. For instance, mobile life stages can alter behavior in response to changes in the thermal environment, whereas immobile life stages are often vulnerable to warming temperatures due to behavioral constraints and the limited microclimatic conditions experienced over small spatial extents (e.g., an embryo in an egg). Unfavorable developmental conditions can reduce growth, alter developmental rates, and increase mortality. Additionally, the developmental environment can influence subsequent life stages via changes in maturation rates, reproductive success, and survival. Therefore, organismal responses to changing environmental conditions can depend heavily on the physiology of immobile life stages as well as the behavioral and physiology capacities of mobile stages.    The first empirical chapter of this thesis (Chapter Two) concerns organismal responses to warming during early ontogeny and the ecological implications of such responses for a widespread ectotherm, the Eastern fence lizard ( Sceloporus undulatus). Through a series of field and laboratory experiments, I examined the effects of recurrent sublethal warming on growth, survival, and distribution of S. undulatus. I then incorporated that data into an ecological model that accounts for variation in responses to warming through ontogeny and across geography. Combining empirical studies with mechanistic species distribution modeling, we demonstrated that organisms with thermally sensitive life stages do not have to experience lethal temperatures to undergo negative changes at the individual and population levels.    The second empirical chapter (Chapter Three) concerns how the capacity for adaptation to mitigate negative impacts of future climates may vary across species ranges. Using a series of field observations and laboratory-based reciprocal transplant experiment, we examined how geographic variation in maternal behavior and thermal physiology underlies patterns of growth and development across the range of the eastern S. undulatus clade. By demonstrating the extents to which genetic background and environmental conditions affect thermal biology across geography, my data serves to increase understanding of the capacities for populations to persist under climate warming.

T1  - The Evolutionary Significance of Body Size in Burying Beetles
AN  - 2056568503
AB  - Body size is one of the most commonly studied traits of an organism, which is largely due to its direct correlation with fitness, life history strategy, and physiology of the organism. Patterns of body size distribution are also often studied. The distribution of body size within species is looked at for suggestions of differential mating strategies or niche variation among ontogenetic development. Patterns are also examined among species to determine the effects of competition, environmental factors, and phylogenetic inertia. Finally, the distribution of body size across the geographic range of a species or group of closely related is looked at for indications of the effects of climate and resource availability on body size at different latitudes and altitudes. In this collection of research, I address the evolution and importance of body size in burying beetles (genus Nicrophorus). Body size is important to several aspects of burying beetle natural history, including competitive ability, fitness, parental care, climate tolerance, and locomotor activity. In Chapter 1, I use a large data set of body size measurements for seventy of the seventy-three Nicrophorus species to make inferences about the distribution of body size within the genus, across its geographic range, and the importance of body size in speciation. I found that the range of body sizes is not normally distributed, with an overrepresentation of small-sized species. I also found that expansion of the burying beetle range has been restricted by their inability to tolerate warm, dry climates, and therefore the majority of burying beetle diversity occurs in the temperature mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Body size also seems to be important in speciation, as almost all sister taxa are significantly different in body size. In Chapter 2 I use common garden experiments to assess the importance of body size for males and females in competition, reproductive output, and starvation resistance. Body size is equally important for both sexes in starvation resistance, but it is more important for males in competitions for carcasses and for females in reproductive output. In Chapter 3 I test for fitness consequences of multigenerational effects of body size in offspring. I found that the larger offspring that are produced by larger mothers and on larger carcasses had higher fitness than small offspring. In Chapter 4 I test for the possibility of brood parasitism in two species of burying beetles, N. guttula  and N. marginatus, which co-occur over part of their geographic ranges. I found that both species are able to detect and remove parasitic larvae. Finally, in Chapter 5 I compiled parent and offspring body sizes from seven species of burying beetles and use them to compare the heritability of body size among species using comparative techniques and a meta-analysis. I found that body size heritability is different between species, but is low for the genus as a whole. Together, these projects provide valuable information on the evolutionary significance of body size in Nicrophorus , and indicate compelling questions for future research into the evolution of body size in burying beetles.

T1  - Persistent Effects of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Exposure Across Generations: A Bioenergetic and Mitochondrial Perspective
AN  - 2037231233
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. PAHs are toxicologically important for both humans and wildlife in large part due to their mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic properties. While the effects of adult and developmental exposures to PAHs are relatively well characterized, the potential for PAHs to have effects across generations is an emerging concern in the field of environmental health. In epidemiological studies, prenatal exposure to PAHs is associated with adverse birth outcomes as well as later life metabolic, neurological, and reproductive disorders— which have become global human health epidemics. These findings have been validated in animal models, with reduced survivorship, increased morphological deformities, and alterations in behavior, physiology, and disease risk in multiple subsequent generations. However, the mechanisms underlying the multigenerational effects of PAHs are poorly understood. This dissertation focuses on mitochondrial contributions to the maternal and cross-generational toxicity of PAHs.   Mitochondria are essential to the development, health, survival, and reproduction of all aerobic organisms. The importance of maintaining mitochondrial function for health is supported by the prevalence of mitochondrial diseases, which clinically manifest in at least 1 in 4,300 people. Mitochondrial diseases often present with metabolic, neurological, and reproductive consequences, similar to those associated with prenatal PAH exposures. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternally inherited and undergoes bottlenecks (i.e. reductions in mtDNA copy number per cell) during oogenesis and early embryonic development, creating potential for maternal and cross-generational inheritance of mitochondrial diseases. Inheritance of mitochondrial dysfunction across generations has been established for genetic, pharmacological, and dietary etiologies. Notably, mitochondria are important targets of environmental contaminants such as PAHs, which affect bioenergetics at multiple levels of biological organization. However, the potential for environmental toxicant-induced mitochondrial dysfunction to have persistent effects across multiple generations is still largely uncharacterized. This is the knowledge gap we address in this dissertation.    To this end, we evaluate the persistent bioenergetic effects of BaP – a model PAH and known mitochondrial toxicant – in F1 (maternally exposed) and F2 (cross-generationally exposed or germline exposed) generations following a chronic maternal (F0) dietary exposure using the model teleost  Danio rerio. Maternally exposed F1 embryos exhibit reduced mitochondrial DNA integrity, reduced mitochondrial function and efficiency, and impaired antioxidant defense systems during development, largely in the absence of effects in exposed F0 females. Metabolic shifts during development create potential for disease pathologies and reduced organismal fitness later in life. In F1 adults, mitochondrial dysfunction presents in cardiac tissue with reductions in mitochondrial reserve capacity. Cardiac function and plasticity are key determinants of fitness in the environment, and impaired function confers disease risk in humans. Maternally BaP exposed F1 fish also exhibit altered locomotor activity throughout life and reduced fear/anxiety behaviors as adults.   PAH-induced changes in mitochondrial function and metabolic plasticity persist in the F2 embryos, two generations removed from the original BaP exposure, suggesting cross-generational reductions in fitness may follow a single exposure event. Metabolic consequences occur in F2 embryos at F0 exposure levels that do not cause significant dysfunction in the F1 generation, with important implications for evaluating the risk associated with the persistent effects of pollution (e.g. lasting impacts of oil spill events) in the environment.    The ability to adjust metabolism is crucial for organisms to effectively respond to a variety of natural and anthropogenic stressors, suggesting that organisms with alterations in fundamental bioenergetic processes may be more sensitive to secondary stressors. Herein we demonstrate that F2 organisms with a cross-generational history of exposure exhibit altered metabolic response to thermal stress, reduced thermal tolerance, and fitness tradeoffs. Cross-generational exposure to BaP potentiates metabolic effects under thermal stress even in the absence of effects at baseline temperature. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to PAHs such as BaP affects mitochondrial function, organismal physiology, behavior, and secondary stress response capacity across generations, creating potential for downstream population and ecosystem level effects.

T1  - Biotic and Abiotic Influences on the Evolution of Elevational Range Limits and Life-History Strategies of Tropical Birds
AN  - 2022345365
AB  - Environmental gradients provide natural forums for understanding how and why species differ. The study of interspecific variation across gradients has provided foundations for our understanding of community ecology, species distributions, life-history evolution and physiological ecology (Janzen 1967; Macarthur 1972; Martin 2015). In this dissertation, I explore questions in these disciplines, using a comparative approach on elevational and latitudinal gradients. My primary focus is understanding the biotic and abiotic processes that limit species distributions and how those same forces scale up to influence the composition of communities on an elevational gradient. I also test a physiological hypothesis for the gradient of life history strategies, the pace-of-life hypothesis, by examining the relationship between metabolic rate and adult mortality probability across a global latitudinal gradient.    I examine these issues in songbird communities on Mt. Kinabalu in Malaysian Borneo (6°N). Kinabalu Park is a large protected area encompassing the largest intact elevational gradient in southeast Asia (400m – 4100m). It is a reserve with tremendous conservation importance; it is a stronghold for more than 90% of Borneo’s endemic bird species including several whose mountaintop ranges put them at risk of extinction assuming upward range shifts due to climate change (Colwell et al. 2008). Understanding the mechanisms that underpin elevational distributions in such megadiverse threatened areas is a central goal of ecology and vitally important to conservation locally and globally.    In chapters 1-3 I used experimental and descriptive approaches to assess the importance of interspecific competition and physiology in setting elevational range limits and structuring communities across elevations. We found evidence that interspecific competition may set range limits in some species, but that aggressive interactions with close relatives could not explain range boundaries in other cases. We also found that birds occupying different elevations had similar thermal physiology, suggesting range limits are not directly set by climatic variables like temperature. Using phylogenetic and trait-based approaches, we found evidence that interspecific competition plays a strong role in structuring bird communities at low elevations, while environmental filtering appears to be important at high elevations. Based on clustering of morphological traits, particularly bill shape, we speculate that the influence of climate on prey size and diversity may restrict many species from high elevation communities.    Finally, we tested the ability of metabolic rate to explain variation in average lifespan within and across latitudes. The pace-of-life hypothesis posits that damaging byproducts from cellular metabolism are the primary physiological driver of lifespan, such that longlived tropical species are expected to have low metabolic rates (Pearl 1928; Hulbert et al. 2007; Wiersma et al. 2007; Williams et al. 2010). We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates and estimating adult survival probability in songbirds at Kinabalu Park (6°N) and in Arizona, USA (34°N). We found that metabolic rate explained variation in annual adult survival probability within sites, but that it could not explain the longer lives of tropical birds compared with temperate zone relatives.

T1  - Determining the Effects of Thermal Increases on Stream Fishes of the Ouachita Mountain Ecoregion
AN  - 2062970192
AB  - Altered thermal regimes affect stream fishes both directly and indirectly, influencing their distribution, growth, reproduction, and survival. Increasing temperatures and growing demand for freshwater highlight the need to predict stream fish responses to increasing stream temperatures; however, we lack information on the thermal tolerances of many warmwater stream fishes. The objectives of my thesis were to 1) determine critical thermal maxima (CTMax) of 10 stream fishes in the Ouachita Mountain ecoregion, and 2) assess stress response by six stream fishes via whole-body cortisol after prolonged exposure to elevated water temperatures. First, I determined CTMax for 10 stream fishes of the Ouachita Mountain ecoregion (20°C acclimation, 2°C per h heating rate). Critical thermal maxima ranged 34.0-38.3°C among species. Blackspotted Topminnow Fundulus olivaceus had the highest CTMax and Orangebelly Darter Etheostoma radiosum and Channel Darter Percina copelandi had the lowest CTMax. Benthic fishes had the lowest CTMax, and the only surface-dwelling species tested had the highest CTMax. The CTMax values determined in my study are useful for developing proactive conservation and management strategies aimed at maintaining or improving stream-thermal conditions, and predicting species most susceptible to thermal change. Lastly, I measured whole-body cortisol concentrations of six stream fishes of the Ouachita Mountain ecoregion after prolonged exposure to elevated water temperatures. I acclimated fishes to 20.0°C, increased temperature 1°C per d, and exposed fishes to treatment temperatures (control, 27.0°C; experimental, 32.0°C) for 14-d. I hypothesized that fishes exposed to 32.0°C would show increased whole-body cortisol concentrations and that levels of stress response would relate to thermal sensitivity (i.e., CTMax, Chapter 2). I found no significant differences in stress response by fishes between the two treatment temperatures. Results from my stress trials represent basal whole-body cortisol concentrations for all my study species except Highland Stoneroller  Campostoma spadiceum. Despite apparent tolerance of, or acclimation to, stressful thermal conditions, fishes may suffer from decreased reproduction or growth; thus, future studies should investigate the tertiary stress response to chronic thermal stress in these species. Whole-body cortisol levels from this study may serve as a baseline for monitoring stress in small-bodied stream fishes inhabiting altered stream systems.

T1  - Moving up: Using Climate, Physiology, and Gene Flow to Characterize Current and Future Geographic Range Limits in Montane Salamanders
AN  - 2025494911
AB  - What causes, maintains, and changes species’ geographic ranges are central questions in ecology and evolution. Geographic ranges are a complex product of both ecological and evolutionary processes, reflecting current biotic and abiotic conditions as well as gene flow, drift, adaptation, and history. It is only through understanding the factors that influence species past and present distributions that we can begin to accurately predict how these distributions will change in the future. Anthropogenic climate change poses a major threat to native biodiversity around the world, but especially in montane systems. Understanding the dynamics at these lower elevation range limits is of particular importance. My dissertation has sought to elucidate why adaptation fails at the range edge and how that influences current and future species distributions. For this work, I focused on mountaintop, terrestrial, lungless salamanders of the genus Plethodon.    A commonly invoked hypothesis for the inhibition of range expansion centers around the idea that asymmetrical gene flow from a densely populated range center prevents local adaptation at the range periphery. In Chapter 1, I quantified gene flow and effective population size along a bidirectional elevation transect in the Smoky Mountains, for the species Plethodon jordani. I found evidence for downslope biased gene flow and more dense mountaintop populations. In Chapter 3, I further explored the potential for asymmetric gene flow to limit adaptation by assessing both gene flow and phenotypic differentiation in the species Plethodon ouachitae in the Ouachita Mountains. Unlike my findings in the Smoky Mountains, in the Ouachitas, there was no indication of asymmetrically biased downslope gene flow, even though population density appears to diminish at low elevation. On the majority of transects movement appeared to be biased upslope. Within a single mountain, I found sampling sites were connected by gene flow supporting a single panmictic population within a mountain. Between mountains, I found an overall signature of genetic structure with populations segregating by mountain, supporting prior work that indicated unique mitochondrial lineages on each mountain. Correlative niche models built on occurrence records for each individual mountain indicate that the abiotic conditions occupied by populations on each mountain are different. These same metrics have been used in other work to indicate niche divergence between species and as indication of niche adaptation. However, I found neither differentiation in metabolic rate thermal sensitivity nor differentiation in acclimation ability between populations on different mountains and populations at different elevations. These findings support that mountaintop endemic  Plethodon, even in the absence of gene flow shows conservation in these ecophysiological traits.    In Chapter 2, I used this species-specific physiology to predict shifts in future distributions for four montane Plethodon in the Southern Appalachians. I was able to predict current range limits with high accuracy using both correlative and mechanistic distribution models for the three mountaintop species. Neither model was able to accurately predict the distribution of the one lower elevation generalist species, most likely because these limits are determined by biotic interactions as well as climate. As hypothesized the mechanistic model forecasted more suitable habitat under almost all future climate scenarios for the three mountaintop species. The choice of global circulation model had an order of magnitude influence on how much suitable habitat was predicted for both distribution modeling methods. All models indicate that these animals will be quickly contracting their distributions upslope.

T1  - Ecosystem Productivity and Water Temperature in Coastal California Streams
AN  - 2023535435
AB  - Land use change is a key driver of change in stream ecosystems worldwide and poses a significant risk to streams in areas with high biodiversity and large human populations, such as regions with Mediterranean climates. Two important characteristics of stream ecosystems, whole ecosystem metabolism and water temperature, are sensitive to the changes caused by urban and agricultural development.    In the first section of this dissertation, the effects of urbanization on stream metabolism (gross primary productivity (GPP), community respiration (CR), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and the ratio of GPP to CR (P/R)) in Santa Barbara, California were assessed by comparing stream metabolism, measured using a single-station diel oxygen change method, across 6 streams with varying catchment urban development between March and July 2014. Environmental variables at each site were measured, including water temperature; light; algal biomass; nutrients (N, P); dissolved and particulate organic carbon; specific conductance; total suspended solids; canopy openness; water width, depth, and velocity; discharge; slope; and elevation. Nitrate concentration was identified as an important driver of GPP, NEP, and P/R, and both GPP and nitrate levels were found to be higher at developed than undeveloped sites. However, elevation was found to be a potential confounding factor in the study, especially for CR, which was significantly higher at higher elevation sites. GPP, NEP, and P/R were related to multiple urban metrics and leaking septic fields were identified as a potential nitrate source driving GPP and P/R.    In the second section of this dissertation, the thermal environment of Santa Barbara streams was characterized using water temperature data collected between 2001 and 2015 in 21 stream locations. Temperatures exceeding the upper tolerance limits (25 °C) for the endangered, native southern California steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were identified and the effects of agricultural, urban, and undeveloped land use on water temperatures were assessed. Sub-lethal temperatures for southern California steelhead trout were found at most sites, but a subset of sites in key watersheds for steelhead conservation efforts sometimes exceeded lethal limits. The warmest sites lacked riparian vegetation, the coolest sites were at high elevations, and the sites with small annual temperature ranges were located where significant groundwater influence was expected. Mean and maximum daily temperatures, in the spring and summer, were positively related to percent impervious surface cover, with evidence that the relationship was driven by warm temperatures at channelized sites. Excluding the channelized sites, minimum daily temperatures in the spring and summer were positively related to percent impervious cover, with or without the inclusion of high elevation sites, possibly indicating warmer groundwater inputs to streams in the urban areas of Santa Barbara.

T1  - Cold-Climate Adaptation in the Five-Lined Skink: A Common-Environment Experiment
AN  - 2006909115
AB  - Ectotherms in cold climates have unique obstacles, especially in winter. Reptiles at higher latitudes or elevations have differing strategies to survive harsher winters, but these differences (e.g. lowered metabolism and lower critical minimum temperatures) may be adaptations or the result of phenotypic plasticity that depends on environmental stimuli or an interactive effect of both. We collected five-lined skinks (Plestiodon fasciatus) from Texas and Minnesota to test for latitudinal differences in winter preparation in a common-environment experiment. We manipulated photoperiod and temperature to be either constant or decreasing, resulting in a 2x2 experiment. We asked three main questions: 1) Is there ecotypic variation between populations of lizards from different latitudes? 2) How do photoperiod and temperature independently or conjointly cue lizards to prepare for winter? 3) What variables can we measure to gauge whether lizards are preparing for winter? To determine how the lizards were preparing for winter, we measured several winter dependent variables. High-latitude lizards had greater oxygen consumption and smaller fat bodies. Lizards exposed to a decreasing photoperiod had greater oxygen consumption and lower blood glucose levels. Lizards exposed to a decreasing temperature had lower oxygen consumption, decreased food consumption, slower sprint speeds, lower critical minimum temperatures, and lower blood glucose levels. There was a significant interaction effect between photoperiod and latitude for oxygen consumption, meaning our high-latitude lizards responded more strongly to the photoperiod cue. This interaction is support for ecotypic variation between latitudes. More of our winter variables were influenced by temperature than photoperiod. Supercooling points and liver glycogen content were not affected by latitude, photoperiod, temperature, or sex. Our evidence of population differences in cold-climate traits could be proven adaptive in experiments that control for parental and developmental effects, but our data suggests adaptation in some variables.

T1  - Thermal and Developmental Ecology of Pupfish, <i>Cyprinodon </i>
AN  - 1978045459
AB  - Pupfish from the genus Cyprinodon are among the most endangered groups of fishes on the planet, with nearly 40% of species being threatened with extinction. These pupfishes are often assumed to be the most temperature tolerant of all fish, coping with temperatures as low as 0 °C and as high as 44 °C. However, conflicting data exist and certain measures of thermal tolerance are not markedly higher in pupfish compared to common game fish. Pupfish egg production and growth has been known to be hampered at temperatures well below what they apparently experience in nature. I addressed why eggs fail to hatch at high temperatures using reciprocal transplant experiments and measurements of oxygen consumption over the course of development. Parental thermal history appears to influence successful hatching more than egg incubation temperature. Eggs which are reared at the ecologically relevant temperature of 33 °C exhibit altered and unusual oxygen consumption patterns compared to eggs incubated at a lower temperature. I employed a capture-mark-recapture study and field experiments in a dynamic and hypervariable creek environment (Salt Creek, CA) to determine whether individual pupfish which experience temperatures as high as 40 °C survive long-term. Pupfish in Salt Creek appear to colonize warm environments during the spring when conditions can be favorable for growth and reproduction; however, these fish risk death by desiccation and heat exposure if they remain in warm environments during the summer months.

T1  - Cellulose Reinforced Thermoplastic Composites by Insitu Ring-Opening Polymerization
AN  - 1953257800
AB  - Over the past two decades, the increasing concern about the negative environmental impacts of synthetic materials has led to rising interests in utilizing renewable natural resources to develop polymer materials with comparable properties and performance to their synthetic counterparts. One of the major fields of interest is polymer composites where the replacement of synthetic fibers with bio renewable natural fibers is of great potential. However, the processing difficulties, in terms of fiber dispersion and thermal stability have limited the application of cellulosic fibers to polymers with low processing temperatures which are mostly hydrophobic polymers. As a result, the true reinforcing ability of the fiber could not be fully exploited due to polymer-fiber incompatibility.    This dissertation discusses a novel approach to develop nanocomposite and composite materials based on high melting point polyamide 6 engineering thermoplastic matrix utilizing the in-situ ring-opening polymerization Both nanoscale cellulose nanocrystals as well as macroscale natural fibers were used as reinforcement. The initial study consisted of a detailed analysis of physical, viscoelastic and rheological properties polyamide 6 nanocomposites reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals in correlation with the morphology and microstructure of the nanocomposites. These nanocomposites were then used a masterbatch for further processing via melt extrusion technique. The effect of surface modification of cellulose nanocrystals with silane coupling agents on isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization of the obtained nanocomposites were fully investigated using a number of different theoretical models to gain a better understanding of the interrelation of surface functionality, microstructure and crystallization behavior.    In addition, the effect of polymer-particle interfacial modification on shear and extensional rheological behavior as well as the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated. The results were correlated with the development of “interphase” in modified systems as confirmed by quantitative nanomechanical analysis. In addition, a series of polyamide 6 composites reinforced with flax fabric and kraft pulp cellulose fibers were successfully developed using vacuum assisted resin infusion process and a through processing-structure-property relationship study was conducted. The findings of this research effort provide a better understanding of the complex processing-structure-property relations of engineering thermoplastics reinforced with cellulosic fibers.

T1  - The Genetic Architecture Underlying Rapid Seasonal Evolution in Natural Populations of Drosophila Melanogaster
AN  - 1951752739
AB  - The rate and tempo at which populations respond to environmental change is fundamental in understanding the adaptive process. Evolution is generally considered to be a gradual process and it is unclear if populations can adapt rapidly to environmental selection pressures. Annual seasonal rhythms produce rapid, predictable environmental changes that may result in rapid adaptation in multivoltine species that reproduce multiple times each year. This work demonstrates that Drosophila melanogaster adapts rapidly and predictably to seasonal environmental changes across five years and multiple locations. Suites of complex fitness traits change in a predictable way over the 10–15 generations from spring to fall. After surviving the harsh environmental selection of the winter, the spring flies are characterized by a increased investment in somatic maintainance: higher resistance to thermal stress, higher tolerance to pathogenic infection, faster development time and better learning. These traits decline throughout the summer when ripening fruit is abundant due to correlated trade-offs with reproduction. Parallel changes in G-matrixes over this seasonal timescale counters the basic assumption of stable covariance over time and indicates that selection acts rapidly to alter the genetic architecture of a population. We show that there are alleles that have functional effects on these important life history traits that oscillate in frequency as a function of seasonal time, but that non-additive epistatic interactions are prevalent and shape the genetic architecture of change across seasonal time. Functional analysis of candidate genes shows that epistatic interactions among seasonally oscillating alleles facilitate rapid adaptation by producing emergent fitness phenotypes. Together, these findings demonstrate rapid, repeatable adaptation to abiotic and biotic environmental parameters that cycle as a function of seasonal time. Epistatic interactions within and among genes facilitate the rapid evolutionary change that is occurring over timescales previously considered static.

T1  - Climate Change and the Effect of Temperature on Forest Insect Pests
AN  - 1948881425
AB  - Insects and other biotic agents are a major source of forest disturbance in eastern North America, with the potential for widespread ecological, economic, and social consequences. Mitigating effects of pest outbreaks requires knowledge of the factors that regulate their populations, and for insects and other ectotherms, temperature is one of the most important of these factors. Here, we tested a number of hypotheses focusing on the effects of different temperature regimes on population level processes. For each chapter we used the southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis), one of the most destructive forest insect pests, as a model species. This insect has undergone important changes in population abundance at both the northern and southern extremes of their distribution. We first investigated the influence of cold temperatures, which have become increasingly important as populations expand northward. We specifically examined the influence of overwintering temperatures on the population life stage structure. We hypothesized that colder temperatures could lead to a convergence of the life stage structure, and this could subsequently produce a high level of synchrony in their flight phenology the following spring. Results from a series of experimental tests, as well as theoretical explorations using development rate models supported this hypothesis; however, field observations were mixed. The second set of hypotheses focused on the effects of high temperature exposure on southern pine beetle populations. As climate change alters global surface temperatures, the occurrence of heat waves are predicted to increase. We analyzed long-term (74 years) temperature records to characterize high temperatures events in the southern pine region. This information was paired with a series of experimental tests of high temperature tolerance in the southern pine beetle, to determine how extreme high temperatures may be impacting southern populations. We experimentally tested both acute and chronic high temperature exposure in northern and southern populations of the beetle. Results from the climate analysis showed no significant change in yearly maximum temperatures throughout the southern pine region, and model results indicated that the characteristics of both common and rare heat waves had not changed over the 74 year study period. Experimental tests of high temperature exposure in southern pine beetle larvae showed a greater than expected tolerance to thermal extremes, and these results were consistent in both northern and southern populations. Overall, we conclude that high temperatures do not explain recent changes in southern pine beetle populations in their historic southern habitat.

T1  - Populations of the Green Porcelain Crab, <i>Petrolisthes Armatus</i>, Vary in Cold Tolerance within the Species' Northernmost Invaded Range
AN  - 1937500836
AB  - The green porcelain crab, Petrolisthes armatus, is a highly abundant invader of intertidal oyster reef habitats in Atlantic waters of the southeastern US. Cold water temperatures likely limit the species’ poleward range, which is predicted to shift as water temperatures rise. I established five study locations along the species’ poleward expansion front from Savannah, GA (Skidaway Island) to Wilmington, NC. Trends in  P. armatus populations and resident crab assemblages were assessed seasonally at each location, and live crabs were collected for cold tolerance incubation trials. The taxonomic composition of crab assemblages differed between locations within each season, with obvious dissimilarities between northern and southern locations in the summer and fall, primarily driven by differences in P. armatus abundance. Abundances were highest in the summer and decreased from southern to northern locations. Sex ratios varied seasonally; becoming male biased in the fall. Adult-sized crabs were collected in the spring, indicating that overwintering of adults does occur. Chronic cold temperature trials were conducted seasonally to expose crabs from each location to decreasing water temperatures and assess sublethal and lethal effects. Crabs from northern locations were more tolerant of cold water temperatures in the fall, possibly due to increased acclimatization plasticity present in individuals from northern populations in response to a comparatively colder environment. Females were more tolerant than males in the summer and spring, possibly due to differences in male and female reproductive stressors. Smaller crabs were more tolerant than larger crabs regardless of season indicating molt cycle may play a role in cold tolerance. Given the trend of warming ocean waters, which may move thermal barriers to P. armatus range expansion to higher latitudes, and apparent higher cold tolerance in poleward populations, there is potential that this species will continue its poleward range expansion.

T1  - Development of thermal tiers and regulatory criteria for Wyoming stream fishes
AN  - 1934393780
AB  - Water temperature is a significant determinant of stream fish distribution due to its impact on fish metabolism, reproduction, and behavior. Because stream thermal regimes are susceptible to warming due to anthropogenic influence, stream temperature is an important focus of surface water quality regulation. The goal of thermal regulation is to maintain a thermal regime suitable for aquatic life. This goal is achieved by identifying and preventing surface water warming that would result in acute or chronic deleterious effects on fish individuals or populations. In this thesis, I use laboratory-derived upper thermal thresholds of Wyoming fish species alongside field-derived data on the same species’ average thermal distributions to propose a revised surface water temperature standard for the State of Wyoming. To develop this proposed standard, I cluster all Wyoming fish species into five thermal management tiers and develop an acute and chronic numeric criterion for each tier. I also compare three stream classification approaches and identify an approach based on modeled stream temperatures as that which achieves the best balance between protection of fishes from thermal impairment and attainability of thermal criteria under Wyoming’s natural thermal regime. Finally, I compile the species-specific thermal threshold values that were used in my analyses into a database to serve as a reference for future temperature tolerance research.

T1  - The Evolution and Genetic Control of Stress Tolerance in a Complex World
AN  - 1925545522
AB  - Natural populations are highly complex and consist of genetically variable individuals that belong to continuously varying age classes. Genotype and age interact to determine how individuals respond to environmental stress, which ultimately determines the evolutionary trajectories and persistence of populations in variable environments. For small ectothermic species, seasonal and diurnal variation in temperature is an important source of environmental stress that impacts activity patterns and suites of phenotypes directly related to whole organism fitness. I used the genetic and ecological model  Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the influence of seasonal and diurnal thermal variability on survival and reproduction in genetically diverse populations. First, I characterized changes in cold tolerance and phenotypic plasticity within a natural population as it responded to seasonal shifts in developmental and short-term acclimation and thermal selection. I found that seasonal variation in cold tolerance was significantly influenced by developmental acclimation that occurred in the field as well as in the lab, where flies that developed under warmer conditions had reduced cold tolerance relative to flies that developed under cooler conditions. Second, I characterized the effect of variation in age on stress response phenotypes in a genetically variable population. I measured genotype- and age-specific responses to multiple environmental stressors, and identified regions of the genome that were associated with age-specific stress tolerance. Genome-wide association mapping revealed that age-specific phenotypes were influenced by distinct sets of polymorphisms and genes, suggesting that the evolution of age-related decline in phenotypes is driven by mutation accumulation within phenotypes, but both mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy between phenotypes. Next, I characterized the costs and benefits of acclimation for survival and reproduction to understand how physiological and behavioral plasticity interact to determine fitness. I found that phenotypic plasticity and the capacity for acclimation significantly influenced behavioral reproductive success, but the thermal cues that led to adaptive acclimation response in survival also led to decreased reproductive success. However, genotypes with the capacity to acclimate were more likely to survive thermal variation and more likely to reproduce, suggesting that genetic capacity for phenotypic plasticity has important implications for whole organism fitness. Finally, I measured the effect of acclimation on the induction of diapause and ability to survive cold stress in the recently introduced invasive species Drosophila suzukii. D. suzukii  is endemic to Asia and was first detected in California in 2008 and in Topeka, KS in 2013. Its recent invasion history thus provides an interesting model to understand the role of plasiticy in the response to a novel and variable environment. I found that diapause was induced through a plastic response to acclimation and short photoperiod, though diapause was more drastically induced by acclimation. Overall, my research provides critical insights into how organisms respond to thermal variation by intergrating quantitative genetics, ecology, evolution, and life history tradeoffs. Collectively, my research demonstrates that the ability of organisms to survive thermal stress is a function of genetic capacity to tolerate stress, genetic capacity for phenotypic plasticity, prior exposure to thermal variation, and the age of the individual.

T1  - Diversity, Distributions, and Evolution of Rocky Mountain and Andean Stream Insects
AN  - 1914917282
AB  - Concordant with latitudinal increases in seasonality, the “climate variability hypothesis” (CVH) posits that the breadth of species’ thermal tolerances should increase with latitude. Across elevations, the “mountain passes are higher in the tropics hypothesis” (MPHT) postulates that the narrow thermal tolerances of tropical species should limit their dispersal across elevations more than the broad thermal tolerances of temperate species. We consequently expect tropical species to have more limited elevational ranges and higher rates of population isolation, divergence, and speciation than temperate species, which could lead to higher tropical than temperate species richness. Moreover, many tropical species might be cryptic, as they have diverged primarily in physiological and dispersal traits, rather than traits with distinct morphological phenotypes. In this dissertation, I investigate how the CVH might provide a mechanistic explanation for global trends in species richness, cryptic diversity, and elevational distributions. In chapter one, I recapitulate the CVH and MPHT hypothesis and summarize related key literature. In chapter two, I characterize the diversity and distributions of stream insects in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. In chapter three, I compare the species richness and elevational ranges of species from the Colorado Rocky Mountains and the Andes of Ecuador. Lastly in chapter four, I integrate data from physiological, landscape genetic, and biogeographic investigations to evaluate the support for the CVH as a key mechanism determining global trends in species diversity, distributions, and vulnerability to climate change.
