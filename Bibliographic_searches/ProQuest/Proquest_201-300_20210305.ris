T1  - Physiological effects of post-harvest commercial practices on the lobster, Homarus americanus
AN  - 2377938123
AB  - The lobster, Homarus americanus (Milne Edwards) is a commercially important species harvested in Canada and exported live to international markets. Landed condition and post-harvest handling practices play a significant role in the ability of an exporter of live lobster to provide customers with a premium product. A set of standardized quality handling, storage and shipping parameters does not exist, an absence that can lead to quality degradation or premature mortality that impacts both the reputation of the H. americanus stakeholders as well as being a potential waste of a limited natural resource. Studies on physiological risk factors for storage, emersion tolerance and cardioventilatory responses to immersion temperature change were conducted to assess their impact on the maintenance of quality in the supply chains of live H. americanus. Based on survival analysis during long term storage, it was found that storage risk factor predictive success was season-dependent, with haemolymph lactate positively correlated with long-term storage mortality in spring-caught lobsters, but not with winter-caught ones. Haemolymph total protein, haemocyanin and refractive index were positivelycorrelated with long term storage mortality in winter-caught lobsters but not spring-caught ones. The immediate pre-harvest acclimation temperature affected the lobsters' response to emersion. Haemolymph pH and lactate levels during emersion revealed that the standard 3 C environmental air temperature, used for commercial live shipments, causes a delay in the onset of anaerobic metabolism in 7.5 C, but not 2.5 C pre-acclimated lobsters. Although H. americanus is reportedly sensitive to changes in environmental temperatures less than 0.5 C, it was found that acute changes in immersed water temperature of 5 C did not elicit an overall change in cardioventilatory activity. Complete haemolymph temperature change occurred within 30 minutes of immersed, acute environmental temperature change, notably faster than was observed in the absence of cardioventilatory activity, indicating the effectiveness of the cardioventilatory activities in H. americanus as a heat exchange system. The current findings, along with existing relevant research findings in the literature, were used to create a template for model commercial post-harvest practices for H. americanus. The template consists of a food quality and safety control program based on the globally-accepted HACCP principles of inductive reasoning that stress proactive versus reactive processes. The current research findings provide critical control points that can be applied throughout the post-harvest distribution chain from first landing to delivery to the end consumer. These critical control points are identified with suggested parameters to use as guidelines for the H. americanus live trade in an effort to improve the consistency of quality and reduce the risks that can lead to product and / or quality loss as a result of incorrect practices.

T1  - The Effect of Chronic and Acute Temperature Exposure on the Antarctic Notothenioid Trematomus bernacchii during Hypoxia Exercise and Feeding
AN  - 2308949307
AB  - Antarctic fish from the Perciform suborder Notothenioidei inhabit arguably the most thermally stable ocean environment on earth. In order to populate the subzero environment Antarctic fish have evolved numerous adaptations. However, specialisation to -1.9 C has incurred a trade off, thermal flexibility is lost likely due to modifications to the cold and as a result Notothenioidei are extremely stenothermic. Climate change mediated warming is predicted to increase the ocean temperature surrounding the Antarctic continent by 2 C within the next century. This increase is projected to affect individuals, populations and the community structures of those inhabiting the area and therefore the physiological study of the acclimation ability and thermal limitations of Antarctic fish is an area scientific interest. The present study is a series of discrete experiments relating to one species, Trematomus bernacchii, a circumpolar benthic Notothenioidei found in nearly all inshore waters surrounding the Antarctic coastline. These studies included investigation of the response of this species to both chronic and acute temperature exposure prior to and following a feeding event, a reduction in environmental oxygen and an exhaustive exercise event, as well as examination of T. bernacchii ability to recovery from these challenges. T. bernacchii demonstrated variable success when acclimated to +3 C. Failure appeared to be determined by the recovery period following capture and aquarium housing, 7 days housing following capture resulted in 100% mortality, conversly 3 months resulted in 100% survival. Following successful acclimation T. bernacchii showed physiological adjustment as acclimated resting metabolic rate mirrored that of T. bernacchii tested at environmental temperature, 20.63 plus or minus 1.3 compared to 22.38 plus or minus 1.02 mg. O2. kg-1. h-1. The previously undefined specific dynamic action response (SDA), in T. bernacchii was characteristic of polar species. At environmental temperatures SDA scope was small 14.52 plus or minus 3.52 mg. O2. kg-1. h-1, and lengthy ,72 hours; SDA duration was reduced to 9 hours in acclimated fish. Resting metabolic rate was elevated following acute exposure to +3 C, 34.27 plus or minus 2.35 mg. O2. kg-1. h-1, masking the SDA response and associated parameters. T. bernacchii were relatively sensitive to hypoxia, Pcrit over four acute temperature exposures, ranged between 69 and 102mmHg, higher than the average range for teleosts (40 - 60 mmHg). Above -1 C Pcrit increased, rising with acute temperature exposure. Ventilation rate was temperature dependent and completely absent at +4 and +6 C. A bradycardia (beginning at 60 and 70mmHg) was observed at all temperature exposures, this response was consistent as all heart rates reduced by 25%. Recovery from both hypoxia and acute temperature exposure was rapid. Following an exhaustive exercise event aerobic Scope of T. bernacchii was constrained over an acute temperature increase, reducing from 38.58 plus or minus 5.64 to 24.41 plus or minus 4.92 mg.O2. kg-1.h-1 over a 7 C temperature increase, respiratory scope too was reduced such that at +4 and +6 C scope was absent. Heart rate of T. bernacchii was highly constrained at -1 C, increasing by 2.54 plus or minus 0.9 bpm following exercise. Acute temperature increase resulted in an increase in cardiac scope, maximum 6.29 plus or minus 1.2 bpm at +2 C, due likely to a thermally mediated loss of cholinergic tonus following exhaustive exercise. Recovery of all parameters was temperature dependent and rapid upon return to -1 C. The present study is the first to quantify and assess the effect of acute and chronic temperature exposure on the SDA response of T. bernacchii. Furthermore, it supplements the current literature on acclimation ability, acute temperature exposure, aerobic scope and hypoxia tolerance for this species. This work will be of use in future investigations of the effects of rapid climate change on Antarctic notothenioid fish and the interconnected ecosystem.

T1  - The exercise physiology of snapper (Pagrus auratus): implications for the better commercial harvesting of an iconic New Zealand finfish
AN  - 2307941137
AB  - This thesis describes a series of discrete studies relating to the exercise physiology of juvenile snapper, Pagrus auratus, an iconic New Zealand finfish that comprises important recreational and commercial fisheries. In particular, we sought to characterise the capacity of snapper for sustained swimming activity, including how performance may differ between fish of different size or with environmental temperature; to determine the consequences of exhaustive exercise for both subsequent swimming activity, an important determinant of survival in escaping or discarded catch, and for tissue biochemistry, which ultimately determines product quality in harvested fish; to validate the use of laboratory-based simulations for the study of capture-related stress by comparing the response of laboratory-exercised snapper with commercially caught fish; and to determine the tolerance of snapper to environmental hypoxia, and further, the possible consequences of hypoxia for swimming capacity and for recovery in fish retained for subsequent rested-type harvest. Juvenile snapper (94-107 mm length, 16-157 g mass) demonstrated a strong swimming capacity, with individual fish attaining critical swimming speeds of up to 7.1 body lengths per second (bl s-1). Swimming performance demonstrated an allometric association, with absolute critical speeds increasing with fish size, whilst relative performance favoured smaller fish. The relation was described by the function Ucrit (m s-1) = 0.003412 [length (mm)] + 0.2669. Critical swimming performance also exhibited variation in response to environmental variables. Thermal performance curves were evident in snapper acclimated to 12, 18 and 24 C, with the suggestion of optimal performance at acclimation temperatures between 18 and 24 C. Critical swimming performance was also significantly reduced during exposure to ambient oxygen tensions below 80 mmHg; at 40 mmHg, snapper attained only 21% of the critical swimming speeds observed under normoxic (150 mmHg) conditions. In juvenile snapper (circa 75 g), exhaustive exercise resulted in severe metabolic, acid-base, haematological and hormonal perturbations, the nature of which were similar to those classically demonstrated in other strong-swimming fish species, especially salmonids. The observations suggest that the response of snapper to exhaustive exercise within the laboratory may underestimate the severity of the response induced by commercial harvest. This is further suggested by post-capture mortality rates of 14%, whereas no mortality was observed following fatigue at Ucrit. Exhaustive exercise also resulted in the impairment of subsequent critical swimming performance. Immediately following fatigue, snapper (85-160 g) were capable of sustained swimming activity at speeds of up to 60-70% Ucrit; however, critical swimming performance was reduced 30%, presumably due to limitations in WM function. There was no suggestion of the recovery of WM function within the first 30 minutes post-fatigue; thereafter, Ucrit was progressively restored, such that snapper were able to repeat their initial swimming performance in a second Ucrit test performed 2 hours after the conclusion of the first. Snapper were moderately tolerant of hypoxia, oxygen-regulating at reduced oxygen tensions (less than 100 mmHg) by virtue of increased ventilatory rate and stroke volume, with a distinct bradycardia developing at PO2 below 60 mmHg. Larger snapper appeared to possess a greater hypoxia tolerance than did smaller fish, with Pcrit resolved to 77 in 20 g fish, and 50 mmHg in 150 and 230 g fish. Exposure to moderate hypoxia (60-80 mmHg) during recovery from an exhaustive exercise event constrained MO2 max to 78% of that of normoxic fish, however did not appear to impede the return of MO2 to routine levels. The present study is the first to examine in detail the swimming performance of snapper, and the consequences of exhaustive exercise for physiological condition. By understanding the swimming capacities of snapper, it may be possible to refine harvesting practices (i.e. tow speeds) or utilise technologies (i.e. net design) such that the water velocities through the trawl net are within the range at which the fish can swim sustainably, minimising the extent of stress and fatigue experienced by fish, and hence their effects on both quality and survival. The study also demonstrates that whilst snapper experience significant physiological disturbance during commercial harvesting, including significant mortality, some fish demonstrate the potential for metabolic recovery, which may permit their retention in an on-board tank facility for subsequent rested-type harvest. Finally, the present work highlights a number gaps in our understanding of the link between harvesting conditions and fish condition, and makes a number of suggestions for future studies or directions.

T1  - Research and development of triploid brown trout Salmo trutta (Linnaeus, 1758) for use in aquaculture and fisheries management
AN  - 2090584586
AB  - Firstly, this PhD project investigated an optimised triploidy induction protocol using hydrostatic pressure. In order to produce an optimised hydrostatic pressure induction protocol three experiments were conducted to (1) determine the optimal timing of HP shock application post-fertilisation, (2) define optimal pressure intensity and duration of the HP shock and (3) study the effect of temperature (6-12 degree C) on triploid yields. Results indicated high survival to yolk sac absorption stage (69.2 - 93.6 %) and high triploid yields (82.5 - 100 %) from the range of treatments applied. Furthermore, no significant differences in triploid rates were shown when shock timings and durations were adjusted according to the temperature used. In all treatments deformity prevalence remained low during incubation up to yolk sac absorption. Overall, this study indicated that the optimised pressure shock for the induction of triploidy in brown trout delivering high survival and 100 % triploid rate (a prerequisite to brown trout restocking) is a shock with a magnitude of 689 Bar applied at 300 Centigrade Temperature Minutes (CTM) for 50 CTM duration. Regarding the assessment of triploid status, the second experimental chapter tested the accuracy and efficacy of three ploidy verification techniques. Results indicated the validity of using erythrocyte indices major nuclear axis measurements, flow cytometric DNA distributions expressed as relative fluorescence, and polymorphic microsatellite loci (Ssa410UOS, SSa197, Str2 and SsaD48) for assessing ploidy status in brown trout. Accuracy of each technique was assessed and indicated that all techniques correctly identified ploidy level indicating 100 % triploid rate for that commercial batch of brown trout. In the third experimental chapter diploid and triploid brown trout were acclimated for six weeks on two feeding regimes (floating/sinking pellet). Thereafter, aggression and surface feeding response was compared between pairs of all diploid, diploid and triploid and all triploid brown trout in a semi natural stream (flume). In each pairwise matching, fish of similar size were placed in allopatry and rank determined by the total number of aggressive interactions initiated. Dominant individuals initiated more aggression than subordinates, spent more time defending a territory and positioned themselves closer to the food source (Gammarus pulex) whereas subordinates occupied the peripheries. When ploidy was considered, diploid trout were more aggressive than triploid, and dominated their siblings when placed in pairwise matchings. However, surface feeding did not differ statistically between ploidy irrespective of feeding regime. Triploids adopted a sneak feeding strategy while diploids expended more time defending a territory. In addition, an assessment of whether triploids exhibited a similar social dominance to diploids when placed in allopatry was conducted. Although aggression was lower in triploid pairs than in the diploid/triploid pairs, a dominance hierarchy was observed between individuals of the same ploidy. Dominant triploid fish were more aggressive and consumed more feed items than subordinate individuals. Subordinate fish displayed a darker colour index than dominant fish suggesting increased stress levels. These novel findings suggest that sterile triploid brown trout feed similarly but are less aggressive than diploid trout and therefore may provide freshwater fishery managers an alternative to stocking diploid brown trout. This thesis also examined the fundamental physiological effects of ploidy in response to temperature regime. The fourth experimental chapter investigated whether temperature tolerance affected feed intake and exercise recovery. Diploid and triploid brown trout were exposed to an incremental temperature challenge (10 and 19 degree C) and subsequent survival and feed intake rates were monitored. Triploids took longer to acclimate to the increase in temperature however feed intake were significantly greater in triploids at high temperature. In a follow on study, we investigated post-exercise recovery processes under each temperature regime. Exhaustion was induced by 10 minutes of forced swimming, with subsequent haematological responses measured to determine the magnitude of recovery from exercise. Contrary to previous studies, there was no triploid mortality during or after the exercise at either temperature. Although diploid and triploid brown trout responded metabolically to the exercise, the magnitude of the response was affected by ploidy and temperature. In particular, triploids had higher levels of plasma lactate, osmolality, and lower pH than diploids at 1 hour post exhaustive exercise. It was evident that the magnitude of the physiological disturbance post-exercise was greater in triploids than diploids at 19 degree C. This may have implications where catch and release is practiced on freshwater fisheries.

T1  - Ecology of West Iberian Kelps: <i>Laminaria ochroleuca </i> and <i>Saccorhiza polyschides</i> living near their distributional limits
AN  - 2007550951
AB  - This thesis focused on the understudied western Iberian kelps. Chapter I focused on population dynamics. With exception of L. hyperborea, shallow kelp forests seemed to be self sustainable, although highly impacted by extreme environmental conditions. With further climate change, it might be expected that the shallower population will become younger and dependent on spore dispersal from the subtidal. In Chapter II the resilience of shallow L. ochroleuca populations was studied. In one of the sites, canopy was completely removed during a storm. Results indicate that extensive removal hampers the population’s ability to recover as it stripes the area from individuals big enough to produce spores. In addition, the lack of protection offered by the canopy hampers recruitment. S. polyschides has different life histories across latitudes. At the poleward range, individuals are able to overwinter and recruit year-round, while low-latitude macroscopic sporophytes are seasonal. While this difference has commonly been attributed to temperature limitations, chapter III shows that temperature does not offer an explanation for the different life histories, raising the novel hypothesis that such difference was caused by nutrient limitations at low-latitudes. Chapter IV focused on the microscopic development of L. ochroleuca and S. polyschides. While they showed similar temperature limitations, S. polyschides showed overall lower mortality and quicker development, despite showing more vegetative growth by the gametophytes when compared to unicellular L. ochroleuca female gametophytes. As both L. ochroleuca and S. polyschides can be found in shallow areas, their thermal stress responses were compared by exposing recruits of the two species, from the geographical edges of distribution of L. ochroleuca, to repeated heat shock, simulating low tides. Recruits of L. ochroleuca from the low latitude areas were the most resistant, while no differences were observed between S. polyschides from the two latitudes.

T1  - Physiological Capacities of Gammarid Amphipods to Survive Environmental Change
AN  - 1779543616
AB  - The aim of this thesis was to investigate the abilities of confamilial gammarid amphipods with differing latitudinal distribution patterns to compensate for environmental change and to examine the consequences. Interesting variations were observed in the strategies employed by gammarid amphipods to cope with environmental change. The boreal/temperate species, Gammarus duebeni, exhibits a high upper thermal tolerance and acclimatory ability, but at the cost of reduced growth and reproductive output. The warmer-water G. locusta appears to have a narrower tolerance and reduced ability to adjust to rapid temperature change, but at stable conditions within its thermal window and at higher salinities it is able to out-perform G. duebeni. G. duebeni may therefore be more likely to survive environmental change, but G. locusta populations may be better able to recover from high mortality events. A similar upper thermal limit and temperature independence of metabolic was observed in the subarctic/boreal species G. oceanicus compared with G. duebeni, however G. oceanicus also demonstrated r-selected life history traits. G. oceanicus and G. locusta occupy overlapping geographical ranges and the same low shore niche, but G. oceanicus appears to have a broader tolerance at a lower optimal temperature than G. locusta. Intraspecific variation was observed between two populations of G. duebeni from Wales (53 °N) and Norway (70 °N). Following acclimation to common temperatures, the northern population was characterised by reduced upper thermal limits and rates of oxygen uptake, a greater thermal sensitivity of oxygen uptake, and evidence of the upregulation of protein synthesis and growth rates in the cold. The influence of the combined factors of salinity and temperature on physiological rate processes in G. duebeni was complex. G. duebeni was less able to adjust to rapid temperature change when acclimated to salinities equivalent to full strength seawater than when held in brackish conditions.

T1  - The physiology and ecology of diapause under present and future climate conditions in the blow fly, calliphora vicina
AN  - 1651902198
AB  - Virtually all temperate insects overwinter in diapause, a pre-emptive response to adverse environmental conditions and for many species a pre-requisite of winter survival. Increased global temperatures have the potential to disrupt the induction and maintenance of diapause. In the first part of this thesis, a four year phenological study of the blow fly, \(Calliphora\) \(vicina\), identifies that diapause is already being delayed due to high temperatures experienced by larvae within the soil layer. Laboratory studies identified that non-diapause life stages are capable of heightening cold tolerance through a rapid cold hardening ability, and winter acclimated adults maintain locomotion at lower temperatures than summer acclimated adults. A previously unrecognised threat, however, is that higher adult temperatures have the transgenerational effect of reducing the cold tolerance of diapausing progeny. In the second part of this thesis, the relationship between diapause and cold hardiness was investigated. The amino acid, alanine, was up-regulated as part of the diapause programme. Non-diapause larvae developed on an alanine augmented-diet expressed cold tolerance phenotypes similar to those of their diapausing counterparts. This adds to a growing body of evidence to suggest that amino acids have a direct role in insect cold tolerance.

T1  - Stress ecophysiology of polar terrestrial invertebrates and the impact of climate change
AN  - 1548711299
AB  - Terrestrial invertebrates are small poikilothermic ectotherms and are thus susceptible to chronic cold, rapid temperature change and desiccation. In the polar regions, where buffered microhabitat temperatures regularly fall below 0°C and water availability is low, they are particularly vulnerable. However, polar terrestrial invertebrates successfully exist within these climes. Using whole organism experimental techniques, this thesis aims to further understand the capacity of invertebrates to tolerate different stressors, the underpinning physiological adaptations, and the potential impact of continued climate change. For just the second time in a freeze-tolerant polar insect, rapid cold hardening is observed. Acclimation to sub-lethal low temperatures is also demonstrated, through depression of the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and chill coma temperature. Contrasting strategies of desiccation tolerance vs. resistance are noted, as well as evidence of cross-tolerance to temperature stress. At the opposite extreme, water submergence experiments confirm the first example of an amphibious terrestrial midge. A remarkable capacity to tolerate high temperatures, including those that may occur as a result of climate change, is also observed. This body of work underscores the physiological flexibility of polar invertebrates, which allows them to flourish in environments considered too extreme and inhospitable for most terrestrial species.

T1  - Ultraviolet radiation and temperature effects on bacterioplankton community structure in Lake Giles, Pennsylvania
AN  - 1524722531
AB  - Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and temperature effects on bacterioplankton community structure were analyzed after a ten-day microcosm study following spring ice melt-out in Lake Giles, PA. Bacterial community DNA patterns and subsequent phylogenetic assignments were produced using terminal restriction length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) and matched to ribosomal database project (RDP-II) gene sequence entries. The primary environmental stressor shifting community composition was UVR, while warm or cold water incubations, at 5-degree increments, either increased or decreased the shift. All UVR exposed samples had decreased diversity and richness compared to UVR blocked samples. Warm water incubations under UVR stress maintained more diversity than cold-water incubations. Species dominance patterns were altered between phyla and within classes of bacteria in each sample. Specifically, Alphaproteobacteria, a dominant bacterial class with diverse members, had different species composition in UVR exposed and blocked samples. Possible UVR tolerance was assigned to different phyla or classes of bacteria. Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Chlorobi were assigned as UVR resistant. With less certainty Gammaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria were also assigned UVR resistant. Phylum Tenericutes was assigned as UVR sensitive. The results present a first approximation of UVR resistance and sensitivity to bacterioplankton from Lake Giles using TRFLP and predicted gene sequences.

T1  - The invasion ecology of Didymosphenia geminata in New Zealand
AN  - 2311936673
AB  - Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) M. Schmidt is a freshwater benthic diatom infamous for its unique ability to bloom in oligotrophic conditions. Two decades ago, there was an abrupt increase in the frequency of these blooms accompanied by rapid range expansion in the Northern Hemisphere. Hypotheses presented to explain this phenomenon included climate change and the existence of a new blooming ecotype. In 2004, D. geminata was first recognised in New Zealand. It was considered a threat to biodiversity and recreational, cultural and economic values. The invasion of the Southern Hemisphere renewed research efforts towards understanding this unsightly species. Because the New Zealand occurrence represented an invasion, Biosecurity New Zealand, a government agency responsible for New Zealand's biosecurity system, lead the response. However, they had very little information about the alga that could be used for strategic planning. Few studies outline the invasion ecology of D. geminata. Meanwhile, it has spread to 37 catchments of the South Island. Managing D. geminata’s invasion process in New Zealand has relied on reports of the alga's habitat profile in the Northern Hemisphere. Based on these, an early assessment of New Zealand's suitability for D. geminata suggested that more than 70% of New Zealand's river sections (stream order greater than 3) were highly suitable for D. geminata establishment. Yet D. geminata is invasive in New Zealand, and invasive species often do not follow traditional habitat preferences when in new ranges. An assessment of D. geminata’s invasion pathway and habitat window in New Zealand was paramount for successful species management. This thesis is a description of D. geminata's invasion ecology in New Zealand. The species' preferences, tolerances, constraints and limiting factors in terms of invasion, colonisation, growth, removal and recovery are described. The analysis is based on three studies of D. geminata's invasion ecology in New Zealand. The first study, based on presence / absence data from national delimiting surveys, determined that overland spread occurred at the same rate as spread between connected bodies of water. The parameters defining D. geminata's habitat window for colonisation were related to substrata, temperature, geological calcium, geological phosphorus and source of flow. The second study used data from a series of region-scale monitoring surveys to examine D. geminata's preferences, tolerances and constraints regarding biomass accumulation. The development of high biomass was constrained by water velocity at a threshold of 0.61 m s-1. Within this constraint, biomass accumulation correlated positively with stream temperature. The third study used data from a two-year biomass monitoring study conducted in three reaches of a hill-fed coastal river. It assessed the roles of water flow and temperature in D. geminata's accumulation, removal and recovery. Temperature and the size of the standing crop were associated with all three phases. Accumulation was additionally influenced by flow variables, while removal was also related to the average size of the substrate particles and depth. The latter also influenced accumulation rates after physical removal. The defined habitat parameters can be used to identify high-risk streams in the North Island and potentially mitigate the impacts of D. geminata in infected catchments.

T1  - The Antibacterial Activity of Honey Against <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>
AN  - 2280537055
AB  - Honey is a food with high popularity, consumption and availability. The effective antibacterial activity of honey, without any reported bacterial resistance or side effects, increases its use in traditional medicine for treating many different kinds of infections. Initially, this study examined the antibacterial activity of honey against Campylobacter jejuni. Six different types of honey, which were commercially available in the UK, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand, were assessed. Honey samples were introduced to Muller Hinton media in three different ways: filtration, autoclaving honey alone and autoclaving honey with media. C. jejuni NCTC 11168 showed good sensitivity to all six investigated honey samples. The minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged between 2 and 10 % for filtered honey. Thermal treatment increased the activity of some honey types and the MIC was 4% for all honey samples, except for clear honey (C. ) Heating honey (2 %, v/v) with the medium resulted in an increase in antibacterial activity with C. jejuni, reducing to undetectable levels after 6 hours of incubation. A similar result was observed when honey was mixed with casein, followed by thermal treatment. This result indicates that thermal treatment generates a selection of new antibacterial agents in the honey-casein mixture (honey-casein MRPs). Factors including temperature and the type of sugar and amino acid present were shown to be important in the generation of antibacterial activity. Heating honey, but not other sugars, with casein or some of its constituent amino acids (e. g. lysine) at 121 C for 15 minutes was shown to be the optimal condition. Further tests revealed that the mixture was effective in vivo and in vitro. A dramatic decrease in C. jejuni colonies to below the limit of detection was observed after 6 hours of incubation in UHT milk with 2 % honey-casein MRPs. The antibacterial activity was also confirmed in an animal model, and C. jejuni was not able to cause infection in Galleria mellonella larvae in the presence of 2% honey-casein MRPs. A significant reduction in the number of C. jejuni cells invading Caco-2 cells was observed when honey-casein MRPs were added to the medium. It is considered that after the treatment (with honey-casein MRPs), C. jejuni was viable, but they lost their culturability and entered a VBNC state according to LIVE/DEAD BacLight staining. The state was irreversible and C. jejuni was not able to recover after transferring to nutrient-rich media. The exposure of C. jejuni to honey-casein MRPs also changed the microbial cell morphology from spiral to coccoid shaped, as confirmed by TEM images. The mixture was also examined against other bacteria such as E. coli, S. typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, S. aureus and H. pylori; but, interestingly, the effects were more limited. A high-performance liquid chromatography technique was used to assess the mixture (honey-casein MRPs). Developing the method for Maillard reaction products separation was successful and a higher number of peaks were observed. This study, overall, has highlighted the importance of honey as an antibacterial agent, as well as a source of other useful compounds formed from honey and specific amino acids under appropriate conditions. These new agents may potentially be used as additives in a new strategy to improve food safety and reduce Campylobacter prevalence in foods.

T1  - Physiological thresholds through early ontogeny: the effects of temperature and hydrostatic pressure on the common whelk Buccinum undatum (Linnaeus 1758)
AN  - 2182415968
AB  - The eco-physiological thresholds controlling the distribution of marine invertebrates are of significance in understanding the evolution of marine diversity. This includes the direction of species radiation throughout the oceans. Range expansions occur as a result of evolutionary adaptations, or through environmentally or anthropogenically driven shifts in distribution. The success of such events is centred around a species ability to adapt; in order for a migration to be successful, all life history stages must tolerate the conditions of the new habitat. This thesis examines the thermal and hyperbaric thresholds affecting range extension in the marine environment. It focuses on the larval development of the shallow-water North Atlantic gastropod Buccinum undatum (Linnaeus 1758). The Buccinidae family consists of a wide range of shallow and deepwater species distributed globally. Improved knowledge on this topic will contribute to our understanding of the adaptations influencing both historical and modern shifts in the distribution of species. The thermal and hyperbaric ranges observed during development indicate B. undatum to have the capacity to develop at both temperatures and pressures outside its current distribution. Thermal acclimation to low temperature was also found to increase pressure tolerance during development. A shift in number of embryos developing and nurse egg partitioning per embryo indicate a decrease in developmental success at temperatures above those it is naturally exposed to. An increase in energetic expenditure, with both increasing temperature and pressure, relates to a rise in the metabolic cost associated with development under either condition. These results, combined with the known life history of B. undatum, suggest range expansion into deep water may be a plausible scenario, but tolerance of warmer conditions remains questionable due to the cold-induced spawning observed in this species. The results of this thesis support theories of high-latitude migrations into the deep sea via cold, isothermal waters, and indeed, suggest polar temperatures may promote the rate at which such range expansions occur. Additionally, the observed metabolic cost associated with development suggests hydrostatic pressure may induce bathymetric limits, which explain patterns observed in reproductive trends, eco-physiological adaptations, and faunal distribution in marine invertebrates throughout the oceans.

T1  - Climate‐Driven Changes in the Recruitment Success of Marine Invertebrates: The Role of Food Supply and Temperature
AN  - 1798434201
AB  - Current trends indicate that key events in the life cycle of marine organisms (e.g. spawning, reproduction, larval release) are taking place earlier in the season in response to global warming associated with climate change. Specific changes in the phenology (i.e. the timing of these life cycle events) of planktonic organisms suggest that responses to climate change are not consistent for all functional groups in the pelagic community. As a result, the tight synchrony that exists between pulses of production of larvae and their food sources could be disrupted; this may cause a decline in survival and affect recruitment levels into a population. Marine invertebrates with complex life cycles from temperate‐cold regions may be particularly sensitive to changes in food availability and temperature as, during the larval phase, many of these species are strongly dependent on seasonal peaks of pelagic food sources. The degree to which mismatches between the timing of larval development and seasonal peaks of planktonic production may influence recruitment success of a species is unknown, and may vary depending on species life‐history. Intertidal barnacles are widely distributed and ecologically important species which serve as a good model species to investigate the impact of potential shifts in food and temperature associated with climate change. Semibalanus balanoides is boreal species which synchronously releases its larvae once a year to coincide with the spring phytoplankton bloom. In contrast, Austrominius modestus is a lusitanean species which releases multiple broods over a much longer period of time, with larval production at its peak during the summer months when food supply is lower. These two contrasting species are ideal models to use in a comparative study aimed at understanding the effects of food limitation and temperature on the recruitment success of marine invertebrates. In this study, I focused on the combined effects of food limitation and temperature on larval performance of S. balanoides and A. modestus. Firstly, I examined whether a reduction in available food at different temperature conditions would have an impact on the recruitment success of either species. This approach was to assess if there were any differences between species responses to potential low food environments and also explored whether changes in temperature could exacerbate any larval responses to low food. I also evaluated the responses of both species to temporal mismatches, simulating food availability as consequence of larval release occurring before or after peaks in food abundance, to identify whether the timing of food availability during larval development was important for recruitment success. Following this, I concentrated on identifying the mechanisms by which these two species may differ in their responses to food limitation and temperature. Here, the tolerance of both species to starvation at different temperatures was examined and the elemental composition of the energy reserves they have upon hatching was assessed to identify any differences that may exist between the species. Finally, I focused on the ingestion rates of both species to see whether they exhibit any differences in their feeding rates in response to a range of food concentrations at different temperatures. A partial energy budget for larvae was also estimated to evaluate if species differed in their capabilities to use food for growth, development and maintenance in different food/temperature environments. Results showed that the timing and abundance of food sources were critical for the recruitment success of S. balanoides and less important for A. modestus. A temperature of 15 °C was sub‐optimal for S. balanoides and tended to increase the negative effects of food limitation. Both food limitation and temperature had strong effects on naupliar mortality and cyprid settlement success rates for S. balanoides and, thus, were important in determining the supply and quality of settlers to a population. When compared to A. modestus, the poorer performance of S. balanoides could not be explained by differences in initial energy reserves or starvation tolerance immediately after hatching as these were comparable between the two species. Considerable differences were observed in the ingestion rates of both species during the early stages and suggested that differences in mass specific feeding rates may be linked to the better performance of A. modestus in food limited environments. In summary, results suggest that recruitment success of S. balanoides would be particularly vulnerable to mismatches of larval pulses with their food sources, particularly at higher temperatures, due to the strong effects of these factors on larval supply and larval quality. In contrast, even under food limited conditions, moderate increases in temperature should not result in strong negative consequences for A. modestus. Work presented here highlights that species‐specific responses to climate‐driven changes in the environment may profoundly affect the abundance and distribution of marine invertebrate species with complex life cycles, through direct and interactive effects of these changes on larval mortality and settlement success.

T1  - Multiple stressor interactions and effects on embryo development of the American horseshoe crab, <i>Limulus polyphemus</i>
AN  - 1654779558
AB  - Organisms in coastal marine habitats experience environmental stressors that may affect their survival and performance. Exposure to thermal stress, hypo-salinity stress and hypoxia occur in coastal habitats and exposure to each stressor in isolation may inhibit growth and development, and even result in death. However, organisms in their natural habitat experience multiple environmental stressors that can interact in ways that may not be predicted from single stressor exposures. The goal of my dissertation research was to investigate how multiple environmental stressors interacted and affected development of a coastal marine invertebrate, the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. I first examined whether nesting horseshoe crabs from the Florida Gulf Coast deposited their eggs in microclimate conditions within the sand that maximized embryo development. The results demonstrated that nests were deposited in locations where oxygen and temperature conditions promoted development while minimizing sulfide exposure. I next examined whether multiple environmental stressors interacted synergistically to negatively influence embryo development by exposing newly-fertilized eggs from a population in the Florida Gulf Coast to treatment combinations of temperature, salinity, and oxygen. These results demonstrated that multiple stressors negatively influenced development by acting synergistically. Finally, I examined whether the multiple stressor tolerance of L. polyphemus differed across a latitudinal range between genetically distinct and geographically isolated populations, using fertilized eggs from Delaware Bay, DE. I exposed these eggs to treatment combinations of temperature, salinity, and oxygen, similar to those used in the Florida study. Fertilized eggs from Delaware Bay responded similarly to multiple stressor exposures compared to eggs from the Gulf Coast of Florida, suggesting that Delaware Bay eggs did not have a limited stressor tolerance. However, the Delaware Bay eggs were more sensitive to hypo-salinity stress, which may have reflected the microclimate conditions found within the sand where they incubate and develop. These three interrelated studies demonstrate that multiple environmental stressors exist in natural habitats, that they can affect embryo development in ways not predicted from single stressor studies, and that microclimate conditions within the sand play an important role in influencing multiple stressor exposure and tolerance of both populations investigated.

T1  - Aquaglyceroporin expression and regulation in erythrocytes from freeze tolerant Cope's gray treefrog, <i>Hyla chrysoscelis</i>
AN  - 1648177350
AB  - Cope’s gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, is a freeze tolerant anuran that accumulates glycerol as a cryoprotectant during cold acclimation. Aquaporins, members of the major intrinsic protein (MIP) family of transmembrane water pores, may play an important role in the mechanism of freeze tolerance by mediating glycerol and water transport across cell membranes. Thus, we hypothesize that HC-3, an ortholog of mammalian aquaglyceroporin AQP3, enhances membrane permeability to glycerol, facilitating the cellular response to osmotic gradients formed when extracellular water freezes. To address the hypothesis, erythrocytes from H. chrysoscelis were used as an in vitro cell culture model to study the regulation of HC-3 protein expression. Compared with warmacclimated frogs, erythrocytes from cold-acclimated frogs showed abundant HC-3 protein and enhanced plasma membrane localization of HC-3. Erythrocytes, regardless of the original acclimation state, exhibited time and temperature-dependent regulation of HC-3 expression and an increase in the abundance of high molecular weight immunoreactive species within 24 hr of culture at 20°C. Likewise, erythrocytes cultured in glycerolcontaining media consistently expressed relatively more glycosylated HC-3 than erythrocytes cultured in normal cell culture media. Thus, part of the regulation of HC-3 expression that occurs naturally during cold-acclimation is cell-based. Erythrocyte protein, when subjected to deglycosylation resulted in downward shift of high molecular weight HC-3 protein, demonstrating that HC-3 is post-translationally modified by Nlinked glycosylation. In the absence of genomic knockout tools, a novel method of antisense HC-3 morpholino delivered in to cultured suspension erythrocytes via a peptide mediated Endo-Porter was developed where HC-3 protein expression was reduced by 94% in morpholino targeted cells (as assessed by Western blotting) as compared to controls. In addition, immunocytochemistry revealed a substantial decrease in HC-3 membrane expression in >65% of erythrocytes, with an additional 30% of erythrocytes showing no HC-3 expression, indicating that the method efficiently knocked down expression in >95% of cells. Furthermore, erythrocytes cultured for 48 hrs in media made hyperosmotic (400 mOsM) through the addition of 150 mM glycerol or urea showed enhanced membrane localization of HC-3 compared with those cultured in control media or media made hypertonic by addition of 150 mM sorbitol or 75 mM NaCl. The degree of hypotonic- induced cell shape changes were less for erythrocytes cultured in glycerol containing media compared to erythrocytes cultured in control media. In addition cell lysis data indicate that 60 % of erythrocytes cultured in glycerol or urea were still intact after 15 minutes as compared to controls, which were completely lysed within 15 minutes of challenge. Taken together, these studies strongly implicate a role for HC-3 in freeze tolerance in H. chrysoscelis.

T1  - Physiology and biogeochemistry of corals subjected to repeat bleaching and combined ocean acidification and warming
AN  - 1647494301
AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations threaten coral reefs worldwide by causing ocean warming and acidification. When seawater temperatures are unusually high, corals lose a significant portion of their vital algal endosymbionts and/or photosynthetic pigments making them appear pale or white – a process referred to as coral bleaching. As corals get most of their carbon from the algal endosymbionts, the breakdown of this symbiosis significantly weakens coral and can lead to widespread mortality if bleaching is severe. Bleaching events have been predicted to become annual events sometime later this century. Despite this knowledge, the impacts of annual bleaching on coral physiology, biogeochemistry, and overall resilience remain largely unknown. For the first time, annually recurring bleaching was simulated on ecologically relevant timescales by subjecting three Caribbean coral species ( Orbicella faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Porites divaricata ) to experimental coral bleaching (+1°C for 2.5 weeks) in two consecutive years. Impacts on their physiology and biogeochemistry were assessed in great detail immediately after repeat bleaching as well as after short and long term recovery. We show that repeat bleaching can dramatically alter thermal tolerance of the coral holobiont (i.e., animal host and endosymbiont). Species such as P. divaricata will be able to rapidly acclimate to frequent temperature stress and persist on future coral reefs, whereas others such as P. astreoides will show increasing bleaching susceptibility and may thus face significant decline.       Coral skeletal carbon isotopes are important paleo-climate proxies and have the potential to record past bleaching events. However, they are often confounded by strong kinetic isotope effects that can mask the bleaching signal in the skeleton and compromise overall accuracy of the proxy. A proposed data correction to remove kinetic isotope effects was tested for the first time using bleached corals. In addition, it was tested if photosynthesis to respiration (P/R) ratios can be reliably calculated from coral isotopes.  We found that the data correction did not effectively remove kinetic isotope effects, and that isotope-based P/R ratios are in poor agreement with P/R ratios measured by respirometry. Therefore, the data correction should not be routinely applied to paleo-climate reconstruction, and P/R ratios should be obtained by respirometry only.     While the potential of some coral species to acclimate to frequent bleaching stress is encouraging, corals will also have to cope with increasingly more acidic seawater, which compromises calcification rates. Yet, the combined effects of ocean acidification (OA) and warming on coral physiology remain poorly understood. We therefore conducted a controlled tank experiment where four Pacific coral species (Acropora millepora, Pocillopora damicornis, Montipora monasteriata, and Turbinaria reniformis) were maintained at seawater pCO2 levels and temperatures expected by the end of this century (741 μatm, 29.0°C). Surprisingly, three of the four species studied were able to maintain calcification rates under these conditions. Further, we show for the first time that coral energy reserves were not catabolized to sustain calcification rates under OA conditions, which has important implications for coral health and bleaching resistance.    Overall, the findings from this dissertation research highlight that some coral species will be able to survive predicted near-future ocean acidification and warming. However, as seawater pCO2 increases beyond 700 μatm and coral bleaching becomes more frequent and intense, temperature- and CO 2-sensitive species will likely face significant demise. Since this is likely to have dramatic consequences for coral reef diversity and overall reef functioning, the future of coral reefs beyond the 21st century may be uncertain.

T1  - Characterisation of the non-starter bacterial flora of stilton cheese
AN  - 1548708021
AB  - This study characterised the bacterial flora of a commercially produced Stilton cheese in an effort to determine the contribution of non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB) to its aroma profile. A total of 123 microbial strains previously isolated from different sites (outer crust, blue veins and white core) of the cheese sample obtained at the end of ripening (~8 weeks) were recovered in MRS and BHI broths and preliminarily identified using conventional microbiological methods in order to establish population diversity and to screen out yeasts and moulds. Organisms identified with partial 16S rDNA sequence analysis were Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumanii and Psychrobacter spp., with the genus Lactobacillus being the dominant (75%) group detected in all the sampled sites. Cluster analysis of pulse-field gel electrophoresis patterns associated the Lactobacillus isolates according to their site of isolation. Lb. plantarum isolates, two from each of the cheese sites, were evaluated for tolerance to heat stress and to different levels of salt, acid and relative humidity (RH) in order to ascertain whether the stress conditions associated with the isolation site could select the phenotype of microbial species recovered. The D72°C values revealed that isolates obtained from the outer crust were more heat sensitive suggesting they may have colonised the cheese post-pasteurisation. All the isolates were sensitive at pH range 3-4 but could grow at pH range 4.5-5. Similarly, isolates could grow at 3.5-5% (w/v) sodium chloride but were suppressed at 10%. Lactobacilli from the outer crust were the most halo-tolerant growing at 8% sodium chloride. For all strains, survival was low at 33-54% RH when cells were suspended in sterile de-ionised water but survived better at 33% RH in maximum recovery diluent (MRD) suggesting cellular protection by MRD. Lb. plantarum isolates from each site (outer crust=7; blue veins=19; white core=24) were tested for antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staph. aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium, Clostridium sporogenes, Lb. pentosus and Lactococcus lactis using the plate agar overlay and paper disc diffusion assays. All the 59 Lactobacillus isolates were tested for plantaricin EF genes using PCR. The nature of antimicrobial activity was examined using cell-free supernatants treated to neutralise acids and/or hydrogen peroxide. Treatment with proteinase K was used to ascertain whether activity was due to bacteriocin (putative plantaricin) production. On solid medium, the isolates had antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, each isolate showing activity against more than one species. Lb. pentosus, Ps. aeruginosa, E. coli and L. monocytogenes were the most sensitive whereas Cl. sporogenes was the most resistant spp. Activity against these organisms was mainly attributed to acid, and to a less extent, hydrogen peroxide and plantaricin production. Whereas Lb. plantarum isolates had a high prevalence of plantaricin EF genes, there was weak evidence for plantaricin production in liquid medium assays. Plantaricin production was only demonstrable among Lb. plantarum isolates from the veins and core against Lb. pentosus, implying the phenomenon was largely dependent on the genotype/strain of Lb. plantarum and was only active against closely related lactic acid bacteria. Subsequently, the effect of growth and survival dynamics of the different genotypes of the organism on the volatile aroma profiles of milk was examined. Individual isolates, one from each of the cheese sites, were co-cultured with acid-producing Lc. lactis (APL) and non acid-producing Lc. lactis (NAPL) in UHT milk under simulated cheese ripening conditions. During early fermentation (0-48 h, 30oC), the isolate obtained from the blue veins stimulated more growth of Lactococcus strains in mixed culture when compared to single cultures and to Lactobacillus isolates obtained from other sites in mixed culture. The volatile profiles of all Lb. plantarum strains grown alone were not significantly different (p>0.05). The type and levels of volatiles detected in mixed culture depended on the genotype/strain of Lb. plantarum inoculated as well as the acidification capability of Lc. lactis with which it was co-cultured. Co-culture of Lactobacillus isolates with APL resulted in increased aldehyde and alcohol production, whereas with NAPL only acetoin synthesis was enhanced. Salt addition had minimal effect on the volatile profiles. During further incubation (12 weeks, 18oC), growth of Lb. plantarum strains was better in salted samples inoculated with NAPL. The NAPL strain remained stable at 7 log10 CFU/ml throughout, while the APL rapidly declined from 9 to less than 5 log10 CFU/ml. The highest level of alcohols, organic acids and acetoin was detected from samples inoculated with the pure culture of the Lactobacillus isolate obtained from the blue veins. Co-culture of the isolate with APL enhanced acid and alcohol production, whereas its co-inoculation with NAPL increased acetoin synthesis. As Lb. plantarum is an incidental organism in cheese, its presence is unpredictable; it was therefore concluded that occurrence of different genotypes of the organism could be a major contributory factor to the variations in the cheese quality characteristics from batch to batch.

T1  - Effects of thermal stress on the brown planthopper nilaparvata lugens (stal)
AN  - 1512397982
AB  - This study investigated the effects of heat stress on the survival, mobility, acclimation ability, development, reproduction and feeding behaviour of the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens. The critical information derived from the heat tolerance studies indicate that some first instar nymphs become immobilized by heat stress at around 30°C and among the more heat tolerant adult stage, no insects were capable of coordinated movement at 38°C. There was no recovery after entry into heat coma, at temperatures around 38°C for nymphs and 42-43°C for adults. At 41.8° and 42.5oC respectively, approximately 50% of nymphs and adults are killed. In a comparison of the acclimation responses between nymphs and adults reared at 23°C and acclimated at either 15 or 30°C, the data indicate that increases in cold tolerance were greater than heat tolerance, and that acclimation over a generation compared with a single life stage increases tolerance across the thermal spectrum. The temperatures that kill around 50% of nymphs and adults also exert negative effects on development and longevity. The same exposures also lower fecundity and extend egg development time through a combination of mating groups, in which the greatest effects occur when both males and females have experienced sub-lethal heat stress. Likewise, exposure to their ULT50 reduced feeding activity in both life stages of N. lugens. The amount of honeydew excreted by females and males in the treated nymph and adult groups were 3-4x and 2-3x lower than in the equivalent control groups. Overall, sub-lethal heat stress extended egg development time, inhibited nymphal development, lowered fecundity and reduced feeding activity.

T1  - An examination of mosquito evolution at multiple taxonomic levels: From genera to subpopulations
AN  - 1511981007
AB  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) offer a unique opportunity to study evolution at multiple levels of divergence. This opportunity is facilitated by extensive research into a few species that contribute to disease transmission, and has uncovered prevalent subpopulation structure in many. Anopheles gambiae , one of the important vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, is one such species in which subdivision has been recorded, as both the molecular forms M and S and as chromosomal ecotypes. Understanding evolutionary relationships within and between species requires understanding both how divergence has proceeded in the past and what are modern forces shaping divergence in the present.   To this end, I began by generating a phylogeny of Culicidae, incorporating both morphological and molecular markers. Strongly supported relationships include the basal location of subfamily Anophelinae, along with internal organization of the tribes Aedini and Sabethini of subfamily Culicinae. Yet, despite including representatives from 25 of 44 Culicid genera, other relationship within Culicinae could not be resolved due to the ancient, rapid nature of their diversification.    Next, we proceeded to examine subpopulation divergence within  An. gambiae. First, we explored patterns of genomic divergence between co-localized M and S populations from western and central Africa, hybridized to a SNP genotyping array. The pattern of M:S divergence is highly conserved across Africa. Furthermore, regions of high M:S divergence are interspersed with regions that cluster based on geographic origin, indicating gene flow is still occurring. We offer a hypothesis to explain the maintenance of such high divergence regions in the face of gene flow, namely, that occasional relaxation of environmental selective pressures allows temporary periods of introgression between sympatric M and S populations.   For my final chapter, focus was switched to the 2La inversion polymorphism in An. gambiae, which is associated with desiccation resistance. We searched for potential phenotypic differences in the cuticle thickness and cuticular hydrocarbon composition between mosquitoes differing in their 2La inversion status, raised in either normal conditions or following aridity acclimation. Few significant differences were found in cuticle thickness. We did, however, find significant differences in arid reared mosquitoes relative to normal reared, regardless of inversion status, in the relative proportion of higher chain hydrocarbons. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster indicate that such differences may be adaptive in nature in terms of heat tolerance, and suggest that further investigations into this area may prove fruitful.

T1  - The role of algal symbiont community dynamics in reef coral responses to global climate change
AN  - 1497276475
AB  - The continued growth and survival of reef-building corals is essential to sustain the goods and services provided by coral reefs, worth billions of dollars annually. However, warming oceans are causing more frequent and severe episodes of coral bleaching, the breakdown of symbiosis between corals and their algal symbionts (Symbiodinium spp.), which threatens corals' survival unless they can adapt or acclimatize. One way that corals may increase their thermal tolerance is by associating with different  Symbiodinium types. Changes in partner abundance may also have functional consequences, but these symbiont dynamics are poorly understood. This dissertation aims to provide a clearer understanding of Symbiodinium community dynamics in corals by investigating changes in both partner identity and abundance over time, the factors driving these changes, and their functional consequences. First, I developed methods to analyze Symbiodinium community structure based on quantitative PCR, overcoming limitations of other techniques while providing a more physiologically relevant metric of symbiont density - the symbiont to host cell ratio. I then applied these techniques to simultaneously assay symbiont identity and abundance in corals under fluctuating environmental conditions. I show that naturally-variable symbiont densities converged under constant conditions to clade-specific equilibria and readjusted to new equilibria when conditions change. To explain these patterns, I used a mathematical model to show that corals maintain an "optimal" symbiont abundance in a given environment that maximizes the net benefit of the symbiosis, suggesting that partner density regulation facilitates coral acclimatization in a dynamic environment. While symbiont abundance in the Pacific coral Pocillopora damicornis increased under warmer temperatures, corals with more symbionts were more susceptible to thermal bleaching, establishing a quantitative mechanistic link between symbiont abundance and the molecular basis for coral bleaching. Higher symbiont abundance also caused more severe bleaching in the Caribbean corals Orbicella faveolata and Siderastraea sidereal , confirming the generality of this phenomenon and indicating that environmental conditions that increase symbiont densities, such as nutrient pollution, may exacerbate climate change-induced coral bleaching. However, corals may resist bleaching by increasing the relative proportion of thermally tolerant symbionts, which I show is more likely to occur when corals bleach more severely and recover at higher temperatures. These findings reconcile conflicting reports over whether corals change their symbionts in response to environmental stress by showing that the magnitude of symbiont shuffling is determined within an ecological framework by disturbance, niche differentiation, and competition among symbiont types. However, species-specific influences also determine symbiont community trajectories, evidenced by greater shifts to thermally tolerant communities in S. sidereal compared to O. faveolata. To investigate potential tradeoffs associated with thermally tolerant symbionts, I measured growth rates of P. damicornis with different symbionts at three temperatures and found that while thermally tolerant symbionts reduced coral growth at cool temperatures, this disadvantage was ameliorated by warming, suggesting that in warmer oceans, these symbionts will benefit reefs by enhancing coral survival at no cost to growth. Finally, a survey of thermally tolerant symbionts in different Pocillopora lineages revealed common associations across host taxa, indicating the widespread relevance of symbiont community variation and dynamics. In summary, this dissertation illustrates that coral performance and stress tolerance are influenced by both symbiont identity and abundance, which are highly dynamic and change in accordance with principles of community ecology. These findings illustrate the importance of symbiotic dynamism in adaptation and acclimatization in diverse biological systems, while highlighting the major role that Symbiodinium community ecology may play in determining the future of coral reefs.

T1  - Acclimatization of the tropical reef coral <i>Acropora millepora</i> to hyperthermal stress
AN  - 1496775016
AB  - The demise of reef-building corals potentially lies on the horizon, given ongoing climate change amid other anthropogenic environmental stressors. If corals cannot acclimatize or adapt to changing conditions, dramatic declines in the extent and health of the living reefs are expected within the next half century. The primary and proximal global threat to corals is climate change. Reef-building corals are dependent upon a nutritional symbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates belonging to the group Symbiodinium. . The symbiosis between the cnidarian host and algal partner is a stress-sensitive relationship; temperatures just 1°C above normal thermal maxima can result in the breakdown of the symbiosis, resulting in coral bleaching (the loss of Symbiodinium and/or associated photopigments) and ultimately, colony death. As ocean temperatures continue to rise, corals will either acclimatize or adapt to changing conditions, or will perish. By experimentally preconditioning the coral Acropora millepora via sublethal heat treatment, the coral acquired thermal tolerance, resisting bleaching during subsequent hyperthermal stress. The complex nature of the coral holobiont translates to multiple possible explanations for acclimatization: acquired thermal tolerance could potentially originate from the host itself, the Symbiodinium, or from the bacterial community associated with the coral. By examining the type of in hospite Symbiodinium and the bacterial community prior acclimation and after thermal challenge, it is shown that short-term acclimatization is not due to a distinct change in the dinoflagellate or prokaryote community. Though the microbial partnerships remain without considerable flux in preconditioned corals, the host transcriptome is dynamic. One dominant pattern was the apparent tuning of gene expression observed between preconditioned and non-preconditioned treatments, showing a modulated transcriptomic response to stress. Additionally several genes were upregulated in association with thermal tolerance, including antiapoptotic genes, lectins, and oxidative stress response genes. Upstream of two of these thermal tolerance genes, inhibitor of NFκB and  mannose-binding lectin, DNA polymorphisms were identified which vary significantly between the northern and southern Great Barrier Reef. The impact of these mutations in putative promoter regions remains to be seen, but variation across thermally-disparate geography serves to generate hypotheses regarding the role of regulatory element evolution in a coral adaptation context.

T1  - The Genetic Basis of Local Adaptation to Thermal Stress in the Intertidal Copepod <i>Tigriopus californicus</i>
AN  - 1494800706
AB  - Populations of the intertidal copepod, Tigriopus californicus,  vary in their tolerance to thermal stress.  In this study, the genetic basis of these differences was examined by generating interpopulation hybrids between a northern and southern population; hybrids were then exposed them to multiple generations of heat stress. At each generation, changes in allele frequency of six candidate genes were monitored. Although allelic frequencies did not change in response to thermal stress, there was evidence of intrinsic selection due to Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities against the southern allele in several of these genes. This observation has important implications for understanding genetic incompatibilities between populations, and the trade-offs between thermal tolerance and overall fitness.

T1  - What happens during soil incubations? Exploring microbial biomass, carbon availability and temperature constraints on soil respiration
AN  - 1494539297
AB  - Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is one of earth's most important and dynamic biogeochemical cycles. Much research is devoted to separating and studying individual controls on SOM decomposition. A commonly-used approach is to incubate soils under controlled conditions to understand the drivers of SOM decomposition. In chapter 1, I explore the use of soil incubations to investigate SOM-temperature dynamics, and emphasize the importance of testing the assumptions of laboratory soil incubations. In chapter 2, I describe how I tested whether depletion of available SOM, soil microbial biomass, or extra-cellular enzyme pools drive the decline in soil respiration over the course of a long-term incubation in soils from two sites (a cultivated plot and a forested plot at Kellogg Biological Station, Hickory Corners, MI USA). I found that the availability of SOM was the key determinant of respiration, and the loss of microbial biomass and extra-cellular enzymes over the course of a long-term incubation did not limit the ability of the remaining microbial biomass to respire available SOM. I observed a sharp increase in respiration when the soils were mixed, which support availability as a key driver of soil respiration. My results support a paradigm in which physico-chemical drivers are the primary determinant of soil respiration over the course of a long-term incubation. In chapter 3, I describe how I investigated the validity of using constant temperatures - a departure from diurnal temperature oscillations soils experience in situ - in laboratory soil incubations. The effect of oscillating versus constant temperature in incubation experiments designed to measure soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition response to temperature is not well studied in the laboratory. I investigated the impact of oscillating versus constant temperature incubation regimes on soils from the two sites listed above with varying levels of available SOM, microbial biomass and extra-cellular enzymes. Over 42 days of incubation I measured changes in soil respiration, changes in the existing microbial biomass and extra-cellular enzyme pools, and shifts in the thermal optima of four common soil extra-cellular enzymes in response to oscillating (shifting between 25°C and 35°C every 12 hours) and constant (30°C) temperature treatments. I found that none of these soil pools were significantly affected by incubation temperature oscillations. My results justify the use of soils depleted of microbial biomass and a constant temperature regime to investigate SOM decomposition in laboratory soil incubations.

T1  - Development of supercritical fluid CO<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub> 2</sub> sterilization method and elucidation of <i>Bacilli</i> endospores' tolerance to hydrogen peroxide and heat
AN  - 1493025951
AB  - When growth conditions become unfavorable, Bacilli species produce a spore that can survive stringent environmental conditions such as heat, UV and ionizing radiation, and chemical treatments. B. pumilus  SAFR-032 was consistently isolated from a spacecraft assembly facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA. The endospores of SAFR-032 showed elevated resistance to 5% hydrogen peroxide. Since hydrogen peroxide is being considered as a spacecraft sterilization agent for future space exploration and life detection missions, the resistance of the Bacilli spores affects the bioload requirements. The goals of this research involved developing a new supercritical fluid carbon dioxide sterilization method and elucidating several aspects of SAFR-032 spores' resistance to hydrogen peroxide and heat. The optimal conditions to inactivate 106 spores of SAFR-032 were 80 atm at 50°C during a 30-minute treatment time. Moreover, the sterilization method inactivated biofilms of SAFR-032, P. aeruginosa,  K. pneumoniae, A. baylyi,  Salmonella spp. and spores of A. nidulans and  A. fumigatus as well. Two manganese catalases, YjqC and BPUM_1305, were identified in SAFR-032 spore's coat. In the presence of hydroxylamine, a manganese catalase inhibitor, the viability of spores after hydrogen peroxide treatment dramatically decreased. The catalases contribute to the protection against hydrogen peroxide not only by decomposition of this compound, but also by formation of a diffusion barrier consisting of oxygen vesicles retained on spore's surfaces. The barrier contributes to protection by limiting diffusion of peroxide to the spore interior. A proteomic study of SAFR-032 spores obtained at 26°C and 42°C showed an elevated amount of small acid soluble proteins and chaperones: GroEL, DnaK and Tig in spores obtained from culture grown at 42°C. The protein levels of both S and L ribosomal subunits did not change except for the following individuals: S1, 8, 10, 16, 19 and L5, 7/12, 22, 25, 19, 35 that showed increased concentration in spores obtained at 42°C. The elevated amount of these proteins was correlated with the higher resistance of SAFR-032 spores to heat. The presented studies provide novel information on spore resistance that will lead to a more profound understanding of their physiology and the development of novel more effective sterilization methods.

T1  - The effect of temperature extremes on cardiorespiratory function in the grass shrimp palaemonetes pugio: Oxygen limited thermal tolerance
AN  - 1466607472
AB  - Aquatic poikilothermic animals must either cope with or compensate for the mismatch in oxygen supply and demand present at high temperatures. Oxygen limited thermal tolerance explains how aerobic scope is limited by insufficient oxygen supply and sets the performance window in animals. This work explores the effects of temperature on the different components of the oxygen delivery system, in both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions to determine if supplying more oxygen to the system mitigates the effects of temperature effects on the cardiorespiratory system and extends oxygen limited thermal tolerance to higher temperatures. The effect of temperature and oxygen condition was measured on both the whole organism and system level. Critical thermal maxima (CTmax) were established in both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions to determine if the mismatch in oxygen supply and demand could be mitigated by supplying more oxygen to the system. (CTmax)  was higher in hyperoxia than normoxia indicating failure was not related to a specific temperature. Ventilatory measurements were made through the development of a novel high speed video microscopy method to measure ventilatory volumes in small aquatic crustaceans. Temperature had a significant effect on all ventilatory parameters measured including scaphognathite stroke volume, ventilatory rate, and ventilation volume. Hypometabolism and hypoventilation were observed in the hyperoxic condition compared to the normoxic condition. This may be a mechanism to save the cost of energy expended for ventilation. Cardiac parameters including heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output were also measured using high speed video microscopy. Heart rate exhibited a temperature dependent tachycardia as did increase in cardiac output, but stroke volume was temperature insensitive. There was a significant effect of oxygen condition on stroke volume with a higher stroke volume in hyperoxia. Analysis of pressure data for time in cardiac cycle points to a biomechanical limitation leading to cardiac failure. Cardiac measurements were expanded using integrated micropressure signals and high speed video microscopy to measure intracardiac pressure and cardiac volumes respectively to generate pressure-area loops. The change in pressure (∆ P) is reduced at high temperatures in hyperoxia compared to normoxia leading to a reduction in stroke and cardiac work in hyperoxia. This reduction in cardiac work leads to cardiac failure at higher temperatures in hyperoxia than normoxia. This data also provides further support of a biomechanical limitation of diastolic filling time leading to cardiac failure at high temperatures.

T1  - Fish growth and degree-days: Advice for selecting base temperatures in both within- and among-lake studies.
AN  - 1465056599
AB  - Ectotherm growth and development are largely a function of temperature. Within the range of thermal tolerance, growth and development increases linearly over a mid-range of temperatures. Degree-days (DD; °C;days) are a method of quantifying the thermal experience of an organism over the linear range and are an increasingly popular method for describing growth and development in fish. To limit degree-day calculations to temperatures within the linear range, a lower temperature threshold (To) is incorporated that defines the onset of growth. However, there is currently no convention for choosing To and the implications of choosing an inappropriate T o are largely unknown. This uncertainty has resulted in a wide range of To values currently in use both among- and within-species. In this thesis I explore i) how To affects the ability of DD to explain within-population variation in fish growth, and ii) the effect of To  on apparent growth among populations in thermally dissimilar environments. To address these objectives, I first use simulated data to determine the theoretical relationship between To and growth. I then demonstrate these theoretical relationships using immature length-at-age data from 8 species and 85 waterbodies in Minnesota USA and Ontario Canada. My results show that DD at low T o are highly correlated and that these highly correlated low T o values explain variation in growth equally well within a single population. Furthermore, growth rates among populations of thermally dissimilar habitat become increasingly dissimilar as To deviates from the To  that minimizes the variation in growth rate among populations. This effect is especially apparent when the among-population range in thermal habitats is large. These findings suggest that, although To matters little when accounting for variation in growth within a single population, an inappropriate To can lead to the appearance of among-population differences in growth. When choosing To, I recommend estimating To using the Charnov and Gillooly (2003)  “10°C rule” and then rounding to the nearest To standard (0, 5, 10 and 15°C). Choosing a To standard in this way will minimize the effect of To error on growth bias in among-population studies. In general, standardization i) simplifies To identification, ii) facilitates comparative studies, and ii) promotes the use of DD in future studies.

T1  - Take my breath away… Physiological responses of Atlantic stingrays, <i>Dasyatis sabina,</i> to cycling hypoxia
AN  - 1436292532
AB  - Atlantic stingrays, Dasyatis sabina, inhabit shallow water seagrass habitats where they experience temperature and salinity fluctuations, as well as natural cycles of hypoxia. In this study I examined changes in gill morphology, critical oxygen minimum, and hemoglobin/hematocrit levels in Atlantic stingrays acclimated for 20 days at normoxia (≥5.50 mg/l), or normoxia with 6 hour intervals of moderate (4.0 mg/l), or marked hypoxia (2.0 mg/l). Neither hematocrit (Range 7.3-7.6 g/dl) nor hemoglobin (Range 24.3-26.7%) mean values differed significantly across treatments. Perhaps the existing hemoglobin is sufficient, or stingrays have switched to a more efficient isoform. Gill dimensions including number of primary filaments, primary filament length, and number of secondary lamellae show increasing trends with severity of hypoxic exposure. Mass specific gill surface areas ranged between 85 and 140 mm2/g, and showed a significant 1.7 fold increase in total surface area between the normoxic and markedly hypoxic treatment group. Fish in the normoxic group had significantly higher critical oxygen minima (0.67±0.11 mg/l) than stingrays in either hypoxic treatment (0.40±0.05, and 0.42±0.06 mg/l). Gill remodeling improves hypoxia tolerance and likely allows Atlantic stingrays to successfully exploit hypoxic habitats inaccessible to predators and competitors, as well as forage across a wider habitat range.

T1  - Effects of thermal acclimation on the critical thermal maxima of the tropical cockroaches: <i>Blaptica dubia, Eublaberus posticus</i> and <i>Blaberus discoidalis</i> (Blaberidae)
AN  - 1426707428
AB  - The Critical Thermal Maxima (CTMax) is a measure of upper thermal tolerance. The physiological response upon reaching CTM ax is similar across taxa, making CTMax useful in comparative studies. The CTMax defines the ecological lethal temperature of an organism and has been used to predict the effects of global climate change. CTMax was determined for adults and first instar nymphs of three species of tropical cockroaches: Blaptica dubia, Eublaberus posticus , and Blaberus discoidalis. Adult cockroaches were acclimated to temperatures of 10°C, 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, 31°C and 37°C for a period of seven days. Blaptica dubia was the only species to survive the acclimation period at temperatures of 10°C and 37°C. All three species survived at 15°C, 20°C, 25°C and 31°C and at each temperature there were significant differences in CTM ax between two or more species. The average CTMax values at 25°C were significantly different between all species, Blaptica dubia (47.82°C ± 0.53°C), Eublaberus posticus  (45.57°C ± 0.42°C) and Blaberus discoidalis  (44.49°C ± 0.44°C).   Across acclimation temperatures, the response of the CTMax varied within each species. Blaptica dubia exhibited a significantly higher CTMax value at 37°C than all other acclimation temperatures (49.18°C ±0.80°C) and Eublaberus posticus had significantly higher CTMax values at 15°C (46.89°C ± 0.35°C) and 31°C (47.27°C ± 0.64°C).  Blaberus discoidalis did not exhibit any significant changes in CTM ax at any acclimation temperature.   First instar nymphs of each species were acclimated at 25°C.  Eublaberus posticus nymphs (44.77°C ± 1.01°C) had significantly different CTMax values than adults. No significant differences in CTMax were detected between first instar nymphs and adults in Blaptica dubia and Blaberus discoidalis .   The rate of the acclimation response was tested in Blaptica dubia  for roaches acclimated at 10°C for a period of seven days then exposed to 37°C. The reverse response was also tested. CTMax values significantly increased when cockroaches acclimated to 10°C (47.06°C ± 0.63°C) were exposed to 37°C for a period of six hours (49.18°C ± 1.13°C), after 96 hours (48.38°C ± 0.79°C) CTM ax values returned to those at 10°C. Animals acclimated at 37°C and moved to 10°C showed no changes in CTMax values.   The findings of this study suggest that tropical cockroaches are limited in their ability to shift their upper thermal tolerance when exposed to novel acclimation temperatures. The CTMax values determined in this study are consistent with previous studies of cockroach CTMax and can be applied to future modeling of the effects of climate change.

T1  - The Effect of Temperature on Phenotypes of the Invasive European Green Crab: Physiologic Mechanisms that Facilitate Invasion Success
AN  - 1418257637
AB  - Invasion physiology is an emerging field that endeavors to understand the influence of physiological traits on the establishment of non-native species in novel environments. The invasive European green crab, Carcinus maenas, is one of the world's most successful aquatic invaders, and is currently distributed across temperate marine ecosystems globally. The work presented here explored the thermal physiology of this species, and has highlighted several physiological traits that have likely influenced establishment success.     Intraspecific comparisons of crabs sampled from the northern and southern edges of their recipient, or invaded range on the west coast of North America have identified both organismal and cellular physiological difference with respect to upper and lower thermal tolerances. Crabs sampled from British Columbia, Canada (BC) had a significantly lower mean upper thermal tolerance threshold and heat shock protein synthesis, Hsp70, compared to their warm acclimated conspecifics sampled from California (CA). These differential physiologic responses may be rooted in the disparate natural thermal habitats that each population occupies within their respective environments.      The ability of this species to extend its current range limits was also investigated. Range expansion to the south has been limited, and is likely restricted by this species lack of adaptation to warmer temperatures. Because range expansion has been chiefly northward, characterizing this species' response to cold stress can identify whether colder temperatures poleward may limit further range expansion. Cold tolerance capacity was determined in the laboratory, and crabs sampled from Vancouver Island, British Columbia were able to withstand the over-wintering thermal regime that occurs in Sitka, Alaska, a site that is currently beyond the range limits of this species. Furthermore, intraspecific assessments found that the cold acclimated BC population exposed to cold shock significantly down regulated protein levels of cyclin D1, cell cycle modulator.     Distinct differences in carapace width (CW) were detected along the thermal gradient present in the green crabs' range. This variation in body size was utilized to the test the temperature size rule hypothesis for ectotherms. Simply stated, the temperature size rule is the tendency for ectotherms to develop slower but mature to a larger body sizes at cooler temperatures. The results supported this hypothesis as crabs sampled from the warm portion of the range were found to be smaller than crabs sampled from the colder portion of the range. This pattern was detected along the native range as well. Differences in body size have the potential to influence the scope of invasion; larger individuals are generally more fecund and longer lived, which can increase both the intensity and frequency of larval dispersal that could further propel range expansion.     The physiologic properties that the green crab possesses which may influence invasion success were examined using peer-reviewed literature with the aim of determining if these physiological traits confer invasion success across taxa. This analysis tested four hypotheses: 1) Broad geographic temperature tolerances (thermal width) confer a higher upper thermal tolerance threshold when comparing invasive and native species. 2) The upper thermal extreme experienced in nature is correlated with upper thermal tolerance threshold. 3) Protein chaperone expression, a cellular mechanism underlying thermal tolerance threshold, is greater in invasive organisms than in native ones. 4) Acclimation to higher temperatures can promote a greater range of thermal tolerance for invasives compared to natives. These preliminary results generally support the four stated hypotheses, and provide a solid foundation for further studies to explore and identify physiologic traits that facilitate invasion success.      Overall, these studies investigated the thermal physiology of  Carcinus maenas from an invasive metapopulation and have brought about significant advances in our understanding of what physiologic traits correlate to invasion success in this species. In addition, the data presented here can aid resource managers in identifying habitats, based on thermal tolerance measurements that fit the criteria for invasion. Understanding how invasive organisms vary with respect to thermal tolerance can aid our understanding the patterns and processes of species invasions.

T1  - Patterns of molecular evolution and epistasis on a genomic and genic scale
AN  - 1417068027
AB  - Epistasis describes non-additive interactions which affect gene expression and phenotype. It can happen on multiple levels, including on a genomic level with interactions between genes or even chromosomes affecting global patterns of gene expression. It can also happen within a gene itself, with epistatic interactions between amino acids affecting gene expression and resultant phenotypes. I present three studies in two organisms to study this phenomenon on a global-genomic scale, and also on a local-genic scale.     First, I present evidence that epistatic interactions between  Y-linked regulatory polymorphisms and genetic background affect global gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster. The  Y chromosome is a heterochromatic, degenerate chromosome and thought to have little evolutionary consequence. I studied Y chromosomes from two populations of D. melanogaster that are known to have major effects on the thermal tolerance of spermatogenesis. I show that these Y chromosomes differentially modify the expression of hundreds of autosomal and X-linked genes, but the effect depends on the genetic background the Y finds itself in. Second, I present novel evidence suggesting that the mechanism for Y-regulatory variation (YRV) is heterochromatin-based. Imprinting (due to parent-of-origin inheritance) in Drosophila has been documented mainly in heterochromatic regions, in particular the Y chromosome. I show that sex-specific transmission of the Y can lead to polymorphic imprinting and can change the magnitude and scope of YRV, perhaps through differential titration of chromatin proteins. In particular, genes responding to this polymorphic imprint were more likely to be male-specific, testis-specific, and involved in rDNA transcript levels. This is particularly intriguing as rDNA processing is known to be affected by heterochromatin formation.    Finally, I study how mutational interactions within one gene can constrain evolutionary trajectories. The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax, varies at several positions in the gene dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), reflecting the mark of selection for drug resistance. Variation at four amino acid sites allows us to reconstruct a complete fitness landscape using all possible combinations of mutational variants within the gene. The results suggest that sign epistasis, where one mutation does well on some backgrounds but poorly on others, is common within P. vivax DHFR. In addition, drug concentration and effective population size can have a strong effect on whether the most resistant, quadruple-mutant, allele will fix in a population. I propose this may explain why the most resistant allele is missing from common polymorphic natural isolates.

T1  - Effet de la température sur le comportement des larves de stade IV du homard Américain (<i>Homarus americanus</i>)
AN  - 1399173258
AB  - The American lobster (Homarus americanus) is a common species found along the East coast of North America, from the Strait of Belle Isle between Labrador and Newfoundland (Canada) to Cape Hatteras in North Carolina (United States). It is, however, more abundant in the southern part of the Gulf of St. Lawrence as well as off the coast of Nova Scotia in Canada and in the Gulf of Maine in the United States. The life cycle of the American lobster has an important pelagic phase where stage IV larvae represent the competent stage (transition phase). The lobster larva, at that time, leaves the pelagic habitat for the benthic habitat. Once on the bottom, the larva rapidly seeks a shelter to limit its vulnerability to predators.    The American lobster may be affected by many environmental parameters. As for most marine invertebrates, the survival, the length of each stage of the life cycle and the behavior may be influenced by the thermal regime. The main objective of this study is to describe in laboratory the time budget of stage IV lobster larvae in relation with temperature. The effect of acclimation to a given temperature on the time budget of larvae is studied as well.    Two acclimation temperatures were used (15 and 20°C). Acclimated larvae were subsequently subjected to three temperature exposures (10, 15 and 20°C) and their behavior observed. A single larva was used in the experimental enclosures in assays conducted in 2009. These observations were compared with those obtained the following summer when a group of larvae was used (5 larvae per assay) under the same temperature conditions to determine whether a larva within a group reacts similarly to an isolated larva.    The time budget established in 2009 (1 larva per aquarium) showed that the percentage of time a larva was hiding was high regardless of the treatment (acclimation and temperature exposure) and the larval batch (larval cohort from the hatchery) compared to other observed behaviors (e.g. swimming, surface swimming and exploration). However, results showed more variability when larvae were acclimated at 15°C. The percentage of time a larva remained hidden was similar for all treatments observed in 2009. Larvae tended to hide quickly in warm water (20°C). In cold water (10°C), larvae tended to hide more rapidly if acclimated at 15°C. They, however, left their shelters more often. Larvae took a longer period of time to hide in cold water (10°C) when they were acclimated at 20°C. They, however, left their shelter less often. Larvae displayed a tail-flick behavior when stressed. This behavior was common in cold water, especially for larvae acclimated at 20°C and exposed to a temperature of 10°C.    The time budgets observed in 2010 (5 larvae per aquarium) remained similar to those observed in 2009 (1 larva per aquarium). A higher variability was, however, observed in 2010. The percentage of time a larva was hiding was low in cold water (10°C). Larvae tended to hide quickly when exposed to a high temperature in comparison to the acclimation temperature. Tail-flicks were observed in larvae acclimated at 20°C and exposed to 10°C, as observed in 2009, but also for larvae acclimated at 15°C and exposed to 10°C. Results showed that the number of larvae did not affect the behavior of the larvae significantly (few interactions between individuals).    Our results show that the behavior of stage IV American lobster larvae was affected by water temperature. Cold water affects the larval physiology as well as the general behavior including the search for a shelter. Behavioral modifications induced by temperature could increase the vulnerability of larvae to predators. Acclimation to cold water appears to decrease this effect and could increase their survival in the wild. This information should be useful to the American lobster industry. The industry has tried for many years to improve its enhancement techniques to increase lobster stocks in the coastal habitat. Larval acclimation before their release in the natural environment could improve the survival of larvae and enhance lobster recruitment.

T1  - Low-temperature tolerance of juvenile spotted seatrout, <i>Cynoscion nebulosus</i>, in South Carolina
AN  - 1353660951
AB  - Spotted seatrout are vulnerable to mortality in winter when water temperature decreases rapidly.  Temporary closures in response to population declines should be based on a thorough understanding of the magnitude of winter mortality.  We used three methods to estimate the low temperature tolerance of spotted seatrout: the chronic lethal method (CLM) and the acclimated chronic exposure (ACE) method using both static and fluctuating temperatures.  All three methods use an environmentally realistic temperature change of 1° C/day.  Fish exposed to constantly declining temperatures using the CLM (n=24) were found to experience loss of equilibrium at a mean (± SD) temperature of 3.57° ± 0.24° C, and mortality at a mean temperature of 3.08° ± 0.31° C.  The ACE method, which uses changing temperatures until a base temperature is reached, was used to evaluate how spotted seatrout (175-220 mm total length) are affected by prolonged, sub-lethal temperatures, and by temporary cooling and warming periods.  The ACE method was performed with both static and fluctuating temperatures, at two base temperatures (5.25° and 4.25° C).  Fish exposed to static temperatures of 5.25°C and 4.25° C (n=46, n=46) had significantly different survival rates (P < 0.001), with 4% and 91% mortality respectively.  Temperature fluctuations around a 5.25° C base temperature did not significantly affect loss of equilibrium or mortality compared to the static treatment at 5.25° C.  Temperature fluctuations at the 4.25° base temperature did not cause greater mortality, but did cause fish to lose equilibrium significantly faster than the static treatment (P < 0.001).  These data can be used to develop predictive mortality estimates for juvenile spotted seatrout (175-220 mm).

T1  - Cardiac Responses to Temperature in Marine Teleosts
AN  - 2461950614
AB  - Through evolutionary and acclimatory processes, organisms, including marine teleosts, have modified a common set of biochemical structures and processes to compensate for challenges presented by changes in ambient temperature. Investigating these biological processes underlying thermal optima and thermal limits of ectothermic species is crucial to determining susceptibility of an organism to shifts in their environmental temperature. An insufficient supply of oxygen under thermal stress is thought to underlie thermal limits in aquatic animals including teleost fish. Therefore, to compensate for effects of temperature, organisms may induce an acclimatory response that enhances cardiac performance and oxygen delivery under a new temperature regime. These changes alter the critical threshold of a temperature stress for an organism and thereby maintain or increase its fitness in its environment. The dissertation research presented here investigates effects of temperature acclimation on whole organismal physiology and cellular and molecular processes in cardiac tissues in three physiologically and ecologically distinct perciforme teleosts – Gillichthys mirabilis, Thunnus orientalis and Trematomus bernacchii. Chapter One focuses on effects of temperature acclimation on thermal limits, metabolic rate, heart rate, oxygen carrying capacity and plasma lactate levels in a highly eurythermal goby species, Gillichthys mirabilis, acclimated to 9°C, 19°C and 26°C for four weeks. Metabolic rate and heart rate measurements were made in fish at their acclimation temperature and when exposed an acute thermal stress. Metabolic rates and plasma lactate levels were also measured in fish recovering from an acute heat stress. Both resting metabolic rates and heart rates at their respective acclimation temperatures did not show a thermal compensatory response with acclimation and maintained elevated rates at warm temperatures. During recovery from an acute stress, only 26°C fish showed post-stress elevation in metabolic rate. Elevated routine and recovery metabolic rates at 26°C suggested an increased energetic cost associated with warm acclimation and when exposed to an acute heat stress; this increased energy demand is possibly to sustain an adequate cellular stress response at high temperatures. Fish acclimated at 19°C and 26°C were able to increase their upper thermal limit and onset of cardiac arrhythmia compared to 9°C-acclimated fish. These data illustrate the pronounced cardiac plasticity and associated phenotypic plasticity of this species. However, this capacity to induce an acclimatory response appears to decrease significantly at temperatures beyond 19°C in G. mirabilis. Chapter Two examined effects of acclimation on cardiac proteome in G. mirabilis acclimated to 9°C, 19°C and 26°C. Proteomic analysis revealed differential expression of proteins involved in cardiac energy metabolism, mitochondrial regulation, iron homeostasis, oxidative stress, cytoprotection against hypoxia, and cytoskeletal reorganization. Proteomic data coupled with in vitro enzyme assay data showed that cardiac energy metabolism, thus aerobic poise of cardiac tissues, is increased in 19°C-acclimated fish compared to 9°C and 26°C-acclimated fish. Overall findings from both Chapters One and Two illustrate that despite their capacity to tolerate a gradient of temperatures, Gillichthys mirabilis exhibit highest cardiac performance near ~19°C, a temperature close to their preferred temperature. Chapter Three investigates the effects of temperature acclimation on cardiorespiratory responses and cardiac and skeletal muscle energy metabolism in a highly stenothermal Antarctic notothenioid, Trematomus bernacchii. Acclimation had no effect on heart rates at resting conditions or the temperatures at which onset of cardiac arrhythmia occurred, suggesting lack of inducible thermal tolerance in cardiac performance in this fish. These data support the hypothesis that cardiac limitations may play a role in reduced thermal tolerance and thermal plasticity of T. bernacchii. Chapter Four examines the effects of acclimation on cardiac transcriptome of endothermic Pacific bluefin tuna Thunnus orientalis acclimated to 14°C, 20°C and 25°C. Overall data indicate that these fish have restored cellular homeostasis at 14°C, potentially optimizing bluefin tuna performance in colder oceans. In contrast, metabolic enzyme activity and gene expression data at 25°C suggest a decrease in total ATP production in cardiac cells, and reduced stress responses. Furthermore, at elevated temperatures cardiac tissues appear to be subjected to heightened oxidative stress and programmed cell death. Together, these data suggest a reduced cardiac performance at ecologically relevant warm temperatures for Pacific bluefin tuna.

T1  - The seasonal biology of the brachiopod Liothyrella neozelanica (Thomson, 1918) from Doubtful Sound, New Zealand
AN  - 2311503802
AB  - Liothyrella neozelanica (Thomson 1918) (Subphylum: Rhynchonelliformea) is a temperate brachiopod that makes up ecologically important habitat in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. From December 2010 to December 2011, the seasonal metabolism, seasonal biochemistry, reproductive cycle and annual growth of L. neozelanica were investigated. Findings enabled direct biological knowledge of a temperate New Zealand brachiopod, providing insight into how the genus Liothyrella has adapted to both temperate and polar environments. Furthermore, the findings enabled insight into how increasing sea temperatures at mid and high latitudes may affect brachiopods belonging to the genus Liothyrella over the next century, as a result of climate change. Seasonal ambient respiration rates of L. neozelanica ranged between 243.5 and 560 micro-g(O2) g-1(AFDM) hr-1 suggesting L. neozelanica actively adjusts its metabolism to changing surrounding environmental conditions. L. neozelanica showed evidence of thermal compensation to seasonal changes in ambient sea temperature and displayed a broad thermal tolerance; aerobically respiring at temperatures 5 C above the maximum ambient sea temperature in Doubtful Sound (18 C). Soluble protein was the major energy substrate utilised within the internal tissues of L. neozelanica; however lipid was found to occur in high levels within the gonads (46% gonad AFDM) suggesting it is stored during reproductive development. Gametogenic observations suggest that L. neozelanica spawns between July and September, although the occurrence of mature oocytes within female gonads throughout an annual period suggests L. neozelanica may undergo multiple spawning events annually. Spawning is likely cued to photoperiod and primary productivity. Growth by L. neozelanica was found to be highest in juveniles (8.4 - 8.9 mm yr-1). The absence of high numbers of juvenile L. neozelanica (less than 10 mm length) in a population size-frequency distribution, suggests juvenile L. neozelanica may require a size-refuge to avoid early mortality. Annual growth cohorts suggest recruitment takes place annually. Biological comparisons between L. neozelanica and the Antarctic brachiopod Liothyrella uva (Broderip 1833) revealed L. neozelanica to have metabolic rates (89 - 110 micro-g(O2) g-1(AFDM) hr-1) 1.9 to 2.9 times higher than those exhibited by L. uva (38 - 46 micro-g(O2) g-1(AFDM) hr-1) after a Q10 correction was applied. Biochemical comparisons revealed both species utilise protein, carbohydrate and lipid in similar ways suggesting this may be a historic link between the two brachiopods. Both species showed evidence of spawning in spring which may occur to coincide with increasing sea temperatures and primary productivity. Growth comparisons revealed L. neozelanica to grow 3 to 5 times faster than L. uva despite reaching similar maximal sizes, L. uva was found to have a greater life-span compared to L. neozelanica (30 + years (L. neozelanica); 46 - 71 years (L. uva)). Based on the findings in this study it is suggested that L. neozelanica will be largely unaffected by warming sea temperatures resulting from climate change over the next century. In contrast, evidence suggests L. neozelanica's polar sister species Liothyrella uva may face physiological (metabolism) and biological (growth and energetics) difficulties as sea temperatures increase.

T1  - Population biology and larval ecology of the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Agassiz 1863) in New Zealand under the influence of Global Climate Change
AN  - 2311503385
AB  - The ocean has absorbed about one third of the total anthropogenic emissions of CO2 since 1800 and, consequently, global mean surface ocean pH has decreased of approximately 0.1 pH unit. This variation of atmospheric CO2 is also correlated with decadal increases in average global temperature by 0.13 C since 1956. Atmospheric CO2 levels are rising annually of 0.5%, and, if emissions are not reduced, a further decrease of 0.14-0.41 and 0.30-0.7 pH units by 2100 and 2300 respectively is expected, in a process called ocean acidification. A concurrent average sea surface temperature increase of 2-4 C is predict by 2100, as another aspect of global climate change defined as global warming. Temperature and pH are known to affect physiology and early development of marine invertebrates and, in the case of temperature, also geographical distribution.  This thesis examines larval and population biology of the echinoid Centrostephanus rodgersii at the Mokohinau Islands, New Zealand, under global climate change. Its growth, population size and age structure and gametogenetic cycle in this region were studied and compared to populations in mainland Australia and Tasmania. The effects of temperature and pH on early life stages of C. rodgersii were compared with those of Evechinus chloroticus and P. huttoni, two echinoids endemic to New Zealand, to provide the first overview of the responses of sea urchins to global climate change in New Zealand. The effect of these variables on the embryos and larvae and the implications of this on the distribution of these species in New Zealand in warmer and more acidic future scenarios are then discussed. C. rodgersii at the Mokohinau Islands is also compared with a population in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, to assess the potential of this species for early adaptation to a new environment.  C. rodgersii was found to grow at a slightly faster pace than the populations in Tasmania and population size and age structure suggest that recruitments occurs regularly. The timing of the gametogenetic cycle is similar to a population from Sydney and spawning takes place between late July and September. Thermal tolerance of fertilisation was very broad in all the species considered, and the process was practically unaffected by temperature. The optimal thermal range was similar through the subsequent developmental stages and was circa 16-23 C for C. rodgersii at the Mokohinau Islands, 17-24 C for C. rodgersii at Coffs Harbour, 12-18 C for E. chloroticus and 12-17 C. These thermal tolerances for development of C. rodgersii agree closely with its present day distribution in New Zealand, suggesting the distribution range is largely controlled by temperature dependant recruitment in this species. Fertilisation was slightly (less than 10%) reduced in all species by pH conditions predicted by 2100 and no buffering effect of temperature was found. A 3 C temperature increase was either neutral or beneficial for subsequent developmental stages in E. chloroticus and C. rodgersii (Mokohinau Islands), it did not affect C. rodgersii (Coffs Harbour) and was neutral or negative for P. huttoni. Lowered pH had a general negative effect, which was always minor, compared to the effect of increased temperature. Larval morphology was affected by lowered pH differently in the three species considered. Pluteus larvae showed either shorter arms (both populations of C. rodgersii and E. chloroticus) or smaller larvae with shorter arms and an altered global morphology (P. huttoni).  This study found that the effects of increased temperature and decreased pH are species-specific. It strengthens the idea that temperature is the main stressor of the early life stages and that it often contradicts the effects of pH. Global organismal responses are, therefore, hard to predict. This study also suggests that embryos and larvae of C. rodgersii in New Zealand are, at present, in suboptimal conditions and that a temperature increase could favour the extension of its geographical range to other areas, despite the negative effects of lowered pH. Further research is needed to detail distribution of C. rodgersii in New Zealand and to clarify potential interactions with E. chloroticus. Physiological measurements on embryos and larvae reared in near future scenarios are also recommended to highlight sublethal effects.

T1  - The Autecology of Tapes philippinarum (Adams and Reeve, 1850) in Southampton Water
AN  - 2177061621
AB  - The non-indigenous venerupid clam Tapes philippinarum (Manila clam) was probably introduced to the Solent and Southampton Water in 2005. Since then clams have been intensively harvested by the local fishermen because of high economic value. Two current measures are in force to regulate the commercial exploitation, (i) the EU minimum landing size regulation (35 mm shell length) and (ii) the district byelaw prohibiting boats from over 12 m fishing within SIFCA district. This thesis presents an investigation the autecology of T. philippinarum in Southampton Water. The knowledge obtained would not only to provide base-line information for the species in the Solent system but also to establish the appropriate fishery management for the sustainability of local stock. Histology revealed that the sex ratio of T. philippinarum was approximately 1:1. Gametogenesis started in February and the gonads matured from May onwards. Spawning was observed between May and September with a single peak from June to August. T. philippinarum in Southampton Water seems to have adapted to the lower water temperature (compared to its native range) of the UK because the gonad was active when the seawater temperature was much lower (4.8 C) than the minimum temperature reported elsewhere to initiate gonadal activity (10 C). The day degree rate required for successful spawning was more rapid (64.27 D degree) than reported in the literature. Two peaks of bivalve larval density in June and August possibly indicated the successful spawning and development into larvae of the clam. The minimum size at sexual maturity of the clam was about 20 mm shell length, only clams larger than 25 mm showed a high percentage of the maturity (87.50-100 percent). In addition, the oocyte diameter of the clams significant related to the shell length and time. Therefore, recent suggestions that the current 35 mm MLS could be reduced to say, 20 mm are not supported by this study. On the contrary, these results indicate that the MLS should not drop below 34 mm. The majority of the T. philippinarum population was within the 30-35 and 35-40 mm shell length size classes. The low proportion of the larger size class (greater than 40 mm) might reflect the use of fishing gear developed during the period when the EU MLS was 40 mm. The environmental conditions in Southampton Water seem to provide T. philippinarum with a favourable habitat as indicated by its annual growth rate (2.93 plus or minus 1.23 mm in shell length) and normal immunocompetence. Winter and the spawning period were the stressors for T. philippinarum revealed by the lower haemocyte count, the thining of digestive epithelial thickness, and the increase in mean luminal radius/mean epithelial thickness. However, the immunocompetence was stabilised by the consistency of phagocytosis. An examination of the synergistic effect of temperature and reproductive development under food deficiency revealed that the winter food levels combined with temperature of warm winter could result in a negative energy balance in T. philippinarum due to insufficient energy input to meet the energy demand for gonad development. The normal growth, good health status and completion of life history indicated that T. philippinarum has successfully naturalised in Southampton Water. Additionally, this bivalve species has great potential to extend its temperature tolerance below published observations.

T1  - Ecological interactions in populations facing environmental stress
TT  - Interações ecológicas em populações sujeitas a stress ambiental
AN  - 1894053367
AB  - O zooplâncton, particularmente os cladóceros, são organismos de água doce importantes na regulação da produção primária dos ecossistemas de água doce. No entanto, também podem adaptar-se a condições salobras. Tendo em conta as previsões no âmbito das alterações climáticas, a intrusão salina pode ocorrer a par com a subida de temperatura. As populações de água doce podem ficar vulneráveis aos efeitos interativos da salinidade e da temperatura, de acordo com os seus limites de tolerância e capacidade de adaptação ao stress ambiental. Assim, a presente tese analisou as interações resultantes das alterações destes agentes de stress em populações de cladóceros de água doce. Primeiro, comparou-se a halotolerância de diferentes genótipos de Simocephalus vetulus provenientes de populações de água doce e de água salobra de modo a avaliar a existência de uma componente genética de resistência à salinidade. A sensibilidade aguda dos genótipos variou na mesma gama de concentrações; todavia, todos os genótipos da população salobra, exceto um, foram mais tolerantes do que os de água doce, em termos de tempo à imobilização. Contudo, não foi possível estabelecer uma relação entre a performance reprodutiva em condições salobras e o contexto ambiental de origem destes genótipos. Mais, estes ensaios mostraram que as populações de água doce têm potencial para tolerar incrementos de salinidade. Como tal, pode-se concluir que a seleção a que os genótipos estão sujeitos no seu local de origem foi mais fraca do que o esperado. Segundo, investigou-se a capacidade de aclimatação de Daphnia galeata à salinidade e temperatura, de modo a avaliar a halotolerância de Daphnia a duas temperaturas num cenário de aclimatação multigeracional. O objetivo foi compreender se a pré-adaptação ao stress ambiental (20ºC e 25ºC versus 0 g/L e 1 g/L de NaCl) influenciou posteriormente as respostas a estes agentes de stress. Verificou-se uma tendência para um aumento de sensibilidade ao NaCl, a temperaturas mais elevadas. No entanto, este efeito foi anulado após nove gerações, mas apenas quando os organismos foram aclimatados aos dois agentes de stress em simultâneo (salinidade e temperatura elevada). Terceiro, demonstrou-se experimentalmente que a salinidade interferiu com a competição interespecífica, alterando a composição das comunidades zooplanctónicas. Este conjunto de evidências permitiu-nos refletir nos múltiplos impactos de agentes de stress, particularmente os relacionados com as previsões de alterações climáticas. Em paralelo aos estudos de natureza experimental, e numa perspetiva de Educação para o Desenvolvimento Sustentável (EDS), importa também promover o desenvolvimento de competências necessárias à compreensão de mudanças ambientais globais (e.g., o impacto da salinidade e da temperatura) para implementar estratégias de mitigação e adaptação. Neste contexto, foi realizada uma atividade com estudantes do ensino secundário, que se tornou uma boa oportunidade para a sua aprendizagem e aquisição de competências de interpretação de dados experimentais, assim como de sensibilização para as questões ambientais.Alternate abstract:Zooplankton, namely cladocerans, are important regulators of primary production in freshwater ecosystems. However, these filter-feeders can also be found in brackish waters and can therefore adapt to this stressful condition. Bearing in mind climate change predictions, saline intrusion can occur in coastal freshwater systems, accompanied by increasing temperatures. Freshwater populations can thus become vulnerable to the interactive effect of salinity and temperature, framed within their tolerance limits and adaptation ability to environmental stress. Taking this into consideration, the present thesis aimed at addressing the complex interactions resulting from the challenge of these environmental stressors on freshwater cladoceran populations. First, the halotolerance of different Simocephalus vetulus genotypes from two freshwater and one brackish population (salinity 2.3) was explored. The goal was to determine whether there was a genetic component of salinity resistance. Clone acute sensitivity was comparable among populations. However, all brackish clones, except one, were more halotolerant than freshwater genotypes, in terms of survival time. Life history assays, carried out with extreme genotypes (from previous experiment) revealed no relationship between fitness and the original environmental context of genotypes. Also, these experiments showed that freshwater populations do have the potential to tolerate salinity increases. As such, we can conclude that the local selective pressure caused by salinity was weaker than expected. Second, the acclimation ability of Daphnia galeata to salinity and temperature was investigated in this study, by evaluating Daphnia’s sensitivity to salinity, at two different temperatures, along a multigenerational acclimation scenario. The objective was to understand whether pre-adaptation to environmental stress (20ºC and 25ºC versus 0 g/L and 1 g/L of added NaCl) influenced the response to the latter exposure to these stressors. A tendency towards the increase of sensitivity to NaCl was observed, at higher temperature. However, this temperature-dependent effect was nullified after nine generations, but only when animals had been acclimated to both stressors (salinity and higher temperature). Third, we experimentally demonstrated that salinity interfered with inter-specific competition, altering the community composition of zooplankton communities. This body of evidence allowed us to reflect on the impacts of multiple stressors, particularly those related to climate change predictions. In parallel with experimental studies, within the framework of Education for Sustainable Development, it is also important to promote the development of the necessary competences towards the comprehension of global environmental change (e.g. the impact of salinity and temperature), in order to implement adequate mitigation and adaptation strategies. Hence, an activity with secondary school students was conducted, providing a good opportunity towards learning and competence acquisition in the interpretation of experimental data, as well as increasing awareness towards environmental issues.

T1  - Organic Aerosol Sources and Chemistry: Insights from Development and Application of In-Situ Thermal Desorption Gas Chromatograph for Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds (SV-TAG)
AN  - 1667442803
AB  - Understanding organic aerosol (OA) sources and secondary OA (SOA) formation is crucial to elucidate their human health and climate change effects, but has been limited by lack of instrumentation capable of in-situ measurements of organic speciation in the atmosphere across the vapor pressure range of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and OA. This dissertation describes 1) the development of a novel instrument based on a thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatograph (TAG), called semi-volatile TAG (SV-TAG) which enables quantitative measurements of specific chemical tracers in SVOCs and OA and 2) application of this new instrument to investigate the various source contributions to OA and SOA formation.      The development of the SV-TAG was initiated by employing a denuder difference method to improve the capability of the TAG for quantitative  gas/particle separation. Using this technique,  hourly time resolution in-situ measurements of organic species were made and then used to investigate the pathways of gas-to-particle partitioning for oxygenated compounds and particle-phase organics were used for source apportionment calculations. The measurements of gas/particle partitioning of phthalic acid, pinonaldehyde and 6, 10, 14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone were explored to elucidate the pathways of gas-to-particle partitioning whereby SOA was formed. The observations show that multiple pathways of gas-to-particle partitioning contribute to formation of SOA in the atmosphere and the dominance of different pathways are compound-dependent. Absorption into particles is shown to be the dominant pathway for 6, 10, 14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone to contribute to SOA in Bakersfield, CA. The major pathway to form particle-phase phthalic acid is likely attributed to formation of condensable salts through reactions between phthalic acid and gas-phase ammonia. The observations of pinonaldehyde in particles while inorganic acids in particles were fully neutralized suggest that the occurrence of reactive uptake of pinonaldehyde onto particles does not require the presence of inorganic acids. The relationship between particle-phase pinonaldehyde and RH suggests that aerosol water content plays a significant role in the formation of particle-phase pinonaldehyde. To investigate the contributions of various sources to OA in Bakersfield, CA, positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis was performed on a subset of the measured particle-phase organic compounds. Six OA source factors were identified, including one representing primary organic aerosol (POA), four different types of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) representing local, regional, and nighttime production, and one representing a complex mixture of additional OA sources that were not further resolvable. POA accounted for 15% of OA on average with a significant contribution from local vehicles. SOA was the dominant contributor to OA, accounting for on average 72% of OA. The rest of OA was unresolved as a mixture of OA sources. Both local and regional SOA had a significant contribution to OA during the day but regional SOA was the largest contributor to OA during the afternoon. SOA formed from the oxidation of biogenic SOA precursors substantially contributed to OA at night. The absorption of organic compounds into particles is suggested to be the major pathway to form SOA, although other pathways also played significant roles.      To achieve quantitative collection of SVOCs following improved gas/particle separation, a new collection and thermal desorption system was developed with the key component being a passivated metal fiber filter collector. This final configuration of the SV-TAG enabled in-situ quantitative measurements of speciated SVOCs with vapor pressures lower than n-tetradecane (C14). The capability for measurements of gas/particle partitioning was demonstrated by measurements of n-alkanes in both gas and particle phases. Organic tracers in both gas and particle phases can be quantified. Percentages of speciated organic compounds in total measured organics can be estimated. For example, ~7% and less than 1% of total measured organics in the same retention range of n-alkanes (C14-C20) in the atmosphere in Berkeley, CA were accounted for by the sum of measured n-alkanes (C14-C 20) and the sum of n alkylcyclohexanes (C14-C20).      The SV-TAG has been demonstrated to enable investigation of the pathways of gas-to-particle partitioning and source apportionment of OA with hourly time resolution. The SV-TAG is also capable of quantitative measurements of speciated SVOCs, defining their gas/particle partitioning in-situ for the first time, and  providing observational constraints on the abundance of SVOCs with which to investigate their primary emissions, chemical transformation, and fate.

T1  - Isothermal Microwave Biology; Catalysis and Fermentation
AN  - 1415375738
AB  - This thesis looks directly into the controversial subject of the microwave field effect by the production of a versatile prototype isothermal microwave reactor for the investigation of enzymatic and microbiological reactions. The observed results from the prototype reactor and experiments conducted conclude that there is a nonthermal, nonlinear response between the exposure microwave power and rate and yield of cellulose saccharification. The nature of the nonthermal response is controversial and may be dependent on the definition of "nonthermal,' leading to ambiguity of exact mechanism.
Enzymatic and microbial conversion of cellulosic material to ethanol is a highly desirable industrial process. Whether the demand is for the mitigation of climate change, political obligations or energy independence, the use of arable land for energy crops limits the available glucose carbon sources for conversion to bioproducts. To prevent this limitation, cellulose (β-l,4-linked glucose polymers) are touted as the "silver bullet" to prevent carbon exhaustion or impinging on food crops.
The technical constraint for the industrialization of cellulose based processing is the rate limitation in the cellulase enzymatic action on cellulose. The enzyme rate is limited by feedback cycles and limited mechanical freedom, therefore a relatively high enzyme concentration is required to speed up the process. To date, the associated enzyme production costs and infrastructure prevents bulk volume exploitation. Biomolecular advances (amino acid substitutions, recombination of expression vectors etc) have gone some way to increase either enzymatic rate or enzyme concentration. The work presented in this thesis differs by increasing the rate of the enzyme without molecular modification. Using a microwave field, the work presented shows that by separating the system into its base units, irradiation of the enzyme/substrate complex in an aqueous environment can increase both the initial enzyme rate and the saccharification yield without alteration of the temperature set point. This study shows that the rate increase is not proportional to the microwave field power. An optimal power in each study is either found or suggested. The results cited show that in the three systems (Endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolase with cellulose, endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolase and β- glucosidase with cellulose, and β-glucosidase with cellobiose) the initial rates can be increased by 201 %, 65.5% and 69% respectively. In the total hydrolytic process (endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolase and β-glucosidase on a cellulose substrate) the final glucose yield was increased by 43% in comparison to the conventional thermal control reaction. This is shown in Figure 1. 10.000 1 9.000 1 8.000 j 7.000 6.000 o 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 I I 1 I U 5.000 r:: o u 4.000 3.000 2.000 j i t t , f 1.000 0.000 Time (hours) =->=OOOW Glucose' ?012W Glucose ?p025W Glucose ~050W Glucose ?075W Glucose Figure 1. Microwave irradiated "cellulase" enzymes with cellulose substrate
For development into an industrial system and looking towards simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was subjected to irradiated microwave fermentations on a glucose substrate. Although inconclusive in terms of rate increase, cell density 1 was comparable across the power range showing that the irradiation does not have a derogatory effect. ! The natural evolution of the conclusions drawn would be development of the system into a SSF or SSCF configuration for bio-product formation is possible with irradiation up to 50SOW.
The novelty of the experiments conducted is twofold. Firstly, the reactor has been designed to ensure that the microwave irradiation is independent of the bulk temperature therefore allowing the exploration of the microwave field effect independently to the thermal effect. Secondly, the microwave source is a continuous microwave irradiation (none pulse irradiation) ensuring that the reaction is subjected to the microwave field for the entire reaction.

T1  - Quantifying heat balance components in neonates nursed under radiant warmers during intensive care
AN  - 1357158835
AB  - Thermoregulation is considered a top priority in neonatology due to the fact that relative to adults, neonates have a morphological susceptibility to excessive heat exchange with the environment, and exhibit limited physiological/behavioural responses to thermal strain. Consequently, the environmental conditions in which they are nursed must be tightly regulated to maintain body temperature stable. Neonatal intensive care units (NICU) use radiant warmers (RW) to thermally manage many newborns. However, recent evidence suggests that RW induce intermittent bouts of thermal strain that could adversely affect patients. This warrants further investigation of neonatal heat balance and the pertinent factors affecting it. Conducting an exhaustive audit of heat exchanges affecting the body during standard care under a RW could yield important information that would lead to the improvement of clinical practice in NICUs. The present thesis focuses on neonatal thermoregulatory responses, various body heat exchange mechanisms and processes during standard care under RW.

T1  - Abiotic and biotic factors affecting light brown apple moth, <i> Epiphyas postvittana</i>, in California
AN  - 1319510106
AB  - With the increase of globalization, the introduction of exotic species into new regions has become a worldwide threat for biodiversity and agricultural production. However, invasiveness of alien species depends on the extent to which abiotic and biotic factors affect the impact of exotic species in a new region. The Light Brown Apple Moth (LBAM), Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is a leafroller native to southeastern Australia that was discovered in California in 2006. At the time of its discovery, little was known about how abiotic and biotic factors might limit its distribution and impact in California and North America. I therefore measured high and low temperature tolerance of LBAM in laboratory studies and found that it exhibited only moderate tolerance of extreme temperatures, which may limit its potential distribution in California and North America. I also monitored LBAM populations in the field and measured parasitism rates over a four year study period to determine the influence of of biotic resistance and to provide baseline population data for use in management decisions. I found that LBAM populations were cyclic or decreasing, had strongly overlapping generations and produced three generations annually in San Francisco and and four in Santa Cruz. The parasitoid assemblage of LBAM in California consisted of many species and parasitism rates were unusually high, but provided no evidence of an ability to regulate LBAM populations. I also found that low density LBAM populations did not exhibit demographic Allee effects, but instead populations of all sizes exhibited strong negative density dependence.    I also studied life history parameters of Meteorus ictericus , the most abundant parasitoid of LBAM in California, and found that it has a number of traits that could account for its dominance in the parasitoid assemblage. It was able to attack and develop in a wide range of host larval instars, had a preference for late larval instars, a female only lifestyle, a low generation time ratio in relation to LBAM, and similar temperature maxima and minima for development. However, M. ictericus exhibited an unusually low lifetime fecundity, which could pose an important constraint on its potential to suppress LBAM populations.      Overall, the results of these studies have provided valuable insights that can be used to better understand the potential geographic distribution of LBAM, and to better inform management decisions. In addition, I suggest that the high level of resistance from resident parasitoids on LBAM in California, in combination with other pest management strategies, could prevent the widespread losses from agricultural crops that were originally anticipated in the United States.

T1  - The phsyiological response of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. to thermal and light stress: A comparison of different phylotypes and implications for coral reef bleaching
AN  - 1318643104
AB  - Coral reefs are one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, however they are extremely susceptible to increases in sea-surface temperature and the on-going effects of global climate change. Increases in water temperature often result in coral bleaching whereby the algal symbionts are expelled from the coral host. Symbiodinium are a group of unicellular endosymbiotic dinoflagellates that commonly resides in the tissues of cnidarians including corals, giant clams, sea anemones, and jellyfish. Symbiodinium is currently divided into nine clades further divided into many subtypes that vary greatly in terms of host association, biogeography, and physiology.    In the eastern Pacific, coral reefs are dominated by Pocillopora  spp. and to a lesser extent, Porites panamensis. Pocillopora  harbor either Symbiodinium C1b-c or D1 while  P. panamensis only harbors C66. The physiological response to thermal stress was investigated in these two corals species. Experiments showed that  Pocillopora harboring D1 symbionts were tolerant to thermal stress, but Pocillopora harboring C1b-c and Porites panamensis  were thermally sensitive and showed signs of bleaching due to increase in temperature. In the spring of 2008, a cold-water bleaching event occurred in the eastern Pacific resulting in the bleaching of colonies of  Pocillopora with C1b-c but not those with D1. Subsequently, I followed growth of these corals during a recovery interval of one year and determined that despite bleaching, fragments with C1b-c exhibited no difference in growth compared to fragments with D1. My work in the Eastern pacific indicates that further increases in temperature and an increase in bleaching events may eventually lead the disappearance of the C1b-c symbiont in Pocillopora in this region.     In the Caribbean, I examined the impact of repeated stress events on three Caribbean corals: Montastraea faveolata, Porites astreoides,  and Porites divaricata. During the first year of stress Montastraea faveolata bleached severely, expelling symbionts and losing chlorophyll as well as exhibiting a large decline in photochemical efficiency. Both Porites species were relatively tolerant with minor losses in cellular density and photochemical efficiency. During the second year of stress, M. faveolata bleached again, but less severely than in the first year, while P. astreoides bleached to a greater extent. Porites divaricata exhibited only minor declines in a few physiological parameters. The increase in tolerance in M. faveolata can be attributed to a shift in its symbiont community from thermally sensitive to thermally tolerant symbionts.  Porites astreoides had a stable symbiosis, but the repeated stress even seemed to increase the corals susceptibility. Porites divaricata  was the most thermally tolerant throughout the entire experiment. This work demonstrates the varying response of different Caribbean corals to repetitive thermal stress and provides new evidence as to how bleaching frequency may affect corals in the future.     Finally I investigated physiological differences among three clones of  Symbiodinium B1 (PK704, PK706, and FLAp2) with photoacclimation to three light levels and then their subsequent response to an increase in temperature. After acclimating to the three light levels (100, 200, and 400 &mgr;mol photons m-2 s-1), Fv/Fm for PK704 was the same at all three light levels while PK706 and FLAp2 had higher Fv/Fm at low light and a lower Fv/Fm at high light. The cultures responded differently to an increase in temperature across the three light levels. Photoinactivation increased with irradiance in PK704 and PK706, with PK704 being more susceptible to the combination of high light and temperature. FLAP2 had the same response at all three light levels and an increase in temperature. There was a small drop in photochemical efficiency during an acclimation period, after which it remained steady. This study illuminates that there are physiological differences at the clonal level among Symbiodinium and underscores the importance of genetic identification of symbionts in future studies.

T1  - The Effects of Hypoxia and Temperature on Developing Embryos of the Annual Killifish <i>Austrofundulus limnaeus</i>
AN  - 1284158131
AB  - Little is known about the physiology or biochemistry of hypoxia (reduced levels of oxygen) tolerance during development in vertebrate embryos.  In most species, relatively brief bouts of severe hypoxia are lethal or teratogenic.  An exception to such hypoxia intolerance is the annual killifish  Austrofundulus limnaeus, in which populations persist in hypoxic environments.  This species inhabits seasonal ponds in Venezuela, surviving through the dry season in the form of diapausing embryos.  Embedded in the pond sediment, embryos of A. limnaeus are routinely exposed to hypoxia and anoxia (lack of oxygen) as part of their normal development.  Here, we exposed embryos to various levels of PO2 (21.2, 15.6, 10.8, 8.4, 6.1, 3.6, and 2.2 kPa) at two different temperatures (25°C and 30°C) to study the effects on developmental rate and heart rate. We also measured enzyme activity and quantified DNA content of individual embryos to compare differences among the varying levels of hypoxia and temperature.  Hypoxia caused a significant decline in developmental rate and caused a stage-specific decline in heart rate.  Higher temperature caused an increase in the developmental rate for those embryos incubated at PO2 of 6.1 kPa and greater.  Temperature had a negative effect by hindering development below a PO 2 of 6.1 kPa.  Total embryonic DNA content was reduced at low partial pressures (15.6, 10.8, 8.4, 6.1, 3.6, and 2.2 kPa) of oxygen.  Citrate synthase, lactate dehydrogenase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were all down-regulated indicating a complete lack of enzymatic metabolic compensation to combat reduced oxygen levels.

T1  - Utilizing laboratory and field studies to determine physiological responses of cattle to multiple environmental stressors
AN  - 1238227428
AB  - A series of studies were conducted to investigate the physiological responses of cattle to multiple stressors. These stressors included heat stress, water restriction, and intake of endophyte-infected tall fescue. Many of the symptoms of these stressors are similar including reduced feed intake, reduced growth rate, hyperthermia, and in extreme cases death. However little is known about the interaction between two stressors.    In the first experiment, Eight Angus steers were maintained for 5 days at thermoneutrality (TN; 19-21°C) in the Brody Environmental Center followed by 14 days of cyclic heat stress (HS; 26-36°C). Water was removed starting on Day 5 of heat stress (dehydration phase). After 3 days, water was returned starting the rehydration phase. Steers showed no lasting effects of dehydration, with the thermal status of the animal returning to normal after 48 hours of rehydration. Unexpectedly, core body temperature remained relatively unchanged despite dehydration, demonstrating their ability to adapt to changing conditions.    In the second experiment, we utilized both a short-term, controlled exposure and a longer-term field exposure to determine adaptive changes. Results from this experiment showed only a few signs of adaptation. With exception of feed intake, animals in the two groups that switched (E-/E+ and E+/E-) treatments responded to the current diet rather than previous exposure, suggesting no adaptation to the toxin. Feed intake was lower for all treatments during the final chamber run which could signify adaptation to heat stress. Sweat rate showed the greatest change between chamber tests, as well as within chamber runs with a reduction after several days in the heat.    In the third experiment, twenty-three Angus steers were subject to both a controlled heat challenge and a field exposure. However, unlike above, animals were placed on pasture prior to a chamber test to adapt to the summer conditions. Steers were given a controlled stress challenge during the peak of summer when they would have the most heat acclimation. In addition to studying adaption of animals to heat and fescue toxicosis, the objective of this experiment was compared the field and chamber exposures to determine how similar the responses under each situation in order to be able to transfer information from one source into another.    In the final experiment, animals were again subjected to both field and chamber exposures. It has been suggested that cattle are more sensitive to endophyte-infected fescue at the end of summer when they have potentially lost some of their heat acclimation. Therefore, this experiment was conducted at the end of summer as temperatures were cooling off. Surprisingly, T rum showed no differences between groups during TN or HS. This is likely due to a decline in feed intake and heat production associated with consumption of endophyte infected seed. While E+ animals did show a large response under TN conditions, their response to HS was similar to experiments 2 and 3 suggesting they are not more sensitive to endophyte-infected fescue at the end of summer.    Results of these experiments showed little evidence that repeated exposure to the endophytic toxins gives animals a tolerance to the endophytic toxins. Feed intake, rectal temperature, sweat rate and skin temperature responded similarly for E+ animals regardless of previous exposure suggesting a lack of adaptation. Sweat rate however, did show signs of adaptation in the E- animals being reduced between the start to the end of summer. Sweat rate also showed a decrease after several days in the heat. This reduction occurred even though rectal temperature and respiration rate were still elevated, suggesting that reduction of sweat rate, and possibly water loss, is more important than a reduction of body temperature during heat stress.

T1  - Brook trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) thermal adaptive potential: Physiological implications for climate change
AN  - 1182844581
AB  - In regard to global warming, coldwater salmonids are becoming more vulnerable as changing thermal conditions threaten the future sustainability of these species. Thermal stress and habitat loss from increasing water temperatures are expected to impact population viability, particularly for inland populations with limited adaptive resources. Although the long-term persistence of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), an archetypal coldwater salmonid, will depend on their ability to cope with and adapt to changing thermal conditions, very little is known about the scope and variation of thermal tolerances within and among brook trout populations and evolutionary lineages. Demonstrating that brook trout from different ancestral thermal environments vary significantly in their ability to tolerate increasing water temperatures, I found that upper thermal tolerance differs among populations and among acclimation treatments. The northernmost brook trout strain (Lake Nipigon) had the lowest thermal tolerance, while the strain with the most southern ancestry (Hill's Lake) had the greatest thermal tolerance. Standard metabolic rate and critical swimming performance varied similarly across acclimation temperatures, peaking at the upper range of a brook trout's preferred temperature range, then decreasing as temperatures reached pejus points. As well, I investigated a potential physiological mechanism underlying intraspecific differences in thermal tolerance via heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsc70). Heat shock proteins were correlated to thermal tolerance; Hsp70 in cardiac and white muscle tissues were linked, while hepatic tissue showed no correlation. I also attempted to establish whether the heat shock response has equable inter-population coping capacity for protein carbonylation incurred through heat shock. Carbonylation of proteins in white muscle and hepatic tissues was suppressed or repaired, suggesting that heat shock proteins were able to adequately cope with increased oxidative damage due to thermal stress. Taken together, these results suggest that populations of brook trout will vary in their ability to cope with a changing climate.

T1  - Food and heat stress in the California mussel: Evidence for an energetic trade-off between growth and survival
AN  - 1112928376
AB  - In response to thermal stress, rocky shore organisms exhibit characteristic physiological changes associated with increased thermal tolerance. Although presumably adaptive, activation of the heat shock response requires an energetic investment and therefore may impose a trade-off between certain life history traits. In this study I investigated the potentially interactive effects of heat stress and food availability on the growth and survival of  Mytilus californianus. Chronic heat stress invoked a cost to individuals, expressed as a reduction in shell growth or size-specific tissue mass, at the same time resulting in increased survival following an acute high temperature event. Overall, mussels receiving less food exhibited poor condition and survival relative to individuals fed more, suggesting that food limitation decreases an individual's ability to mitigate the costs of thermal stress. My data provide support for the idea that acclimatory responses to temperature stress can drive a trade-off between survival and growth or condition.

T1  - Potential Effects of Climate Change on the Biogeographic Distributions of Two Marine Gastropods: Insights from Mechanistic Studies
AN  - 1112840962
AB  - Evidence of climate change has now been observed in many ecosystems, and there is an increasing need to predict how species may be influenced by future environmental conditions. Models forecasting future distributions of organisms often assume that heat stress decreases with increasing latitude, populations within a species have similar stress tolerances, and temperature is the primary determinant of species biogeographic range boundaries. Species ranges are thus generally predicted to shift poleward with global warming. However, these assumptions neglect the fact that other ecological and evolutionary processes can also control species distributions, and influence their response to climate change. In this dissertation, I evaluated these assumptions using empirical studies of two intertidal gastropod species that occur along the northeastern Pacific coast: the channeled dogwhelk Nucella canaliculata  and the specialist seaweed limpet Lottia insessa. My results demonstrate how mechanistic studies can inform more accurate predictions for species responses to climate change.   In Chapter 1, I used laboratory experiments to show that populations of the snail N. canaliculata had evolved genetic differences in their tolerance of heat stress, and that southern populations were less heat tolerant than their northern counterparts. This geographic variation in thermal tolerance mirrored the pattern of intertidal thermal stress along the coast, where northern sites were hotter than southern sites due to regional variation in the timing of low tides. Geographic patterns of environmental conditions and stress tolerant genotypes were spatially complex, and may modulate the effects of climate change on local population extinctions and species range shifts.   To assess the effects of future climate change on potential species range shifts, it is crucial to have baseline data on current distributional patterns. However, accurate documentation of the distribution and locations of range boundaries is lacking for most species. In Chapter 2, I examined museum collections and conducted field surveys to document the distribution of the limpet  L. insessa along the northeastern Pacific coast, and clarified that the northern range boundary of this species occurs at Cape Arago in southern Oregon, USA.   In Chapter 3, I used a series of field studies and laboratory experiments to test whether the northern range boundary of L. insessa at Cape Arago is constrained by three ecological factors: (1) the limpet's physiological intolerance of the temperatures found beyond the range boundary, (2) increased mortality due to stronger wave disturbance beyond the range boundary, or (3) low densities (or the absence) of its host kelp ( Egregia menziesii) beyond the range boundary. I found little support for temperature and wave disturbance in constraining the distribution of  L. insessa, and conclude that dispersal barriers created by limited availability of suitable rocky habitat appear to be the most important determinant setting the range boundary of this species. Since the range boundary of L. insessa is not set by its intolerance of cold temperatures, its range may not necessarily shift poleward as predicted even as temperatures warm.   In Chapter 4, I conducted a laboratory experiment to test empirically how the lecithotrophic (non-feeding) larvae of L. insessa will respond to future ocean conditions (elevated temperature and reduced pH). I found that fewer larvae survived to settlement under elevated temperatures, and that larval shell size was affected negatively and additively by elevated temperature and reduced pH. However, larval duration was not affected by changes in these two factors. This study suggests that lecithotrophic larvae that rely on maternal provisioning may be constrained energetically in their capacity to respond to multiple environmental stressors, and that they may be more vulnerable to climate change compared to planktotrophic larvae that can feed in the plankton to compensate for the increased metabolic costs of development under stressful conditions.   Taken together, results from Chapters 3 and 4 suggest that warming temperatures in the future may not necessarily facilitate a poleward range extension in  L. insessa, whose current range boundary is limited by habitat rather than temperature. Instead, reduced larval survival under warmer temperatures may further decrease recruitment in this species that is already recruitment-limited at the current range edge, and this may potentially result in a range contraction. These complexities suggest that predictions of future changes in species distributions will benefit from a mechanistic understanding of how current species range boundaries are maintained, and how these determinants may be altered in the face of climate change.

T1  - Factors influencing critical thermal limits in insects
AN  - 1101743060
AB  - Studies of thermal responses in animals are important for our understanding of biogeographic patterns, as well as formulating predictions about how species will respond to global climate change. For this dissertation, I focused on factors that determine the upper thermal limits to activity, or critical thermal maxima (CTmax), in insects. I used a newly developed technique, thermolimit respirometry, to measure CTmax in insects as the cessation of spiracular activity. First, I examined variation in CTmax and mortality across development in beetles ( Tenebrio molitor). We found significant variation among life stages in CO2 release patterns, CTmax, and lethal temperatures. Patterns of CO2 release during heating differed dramatically between the adult and pre-adult life stages, and both CTmax and the range of lethal temperatures were significantly higher in adults compared to the pre-adult stages. Lethal temperatures occurred shortly following CTmax  in all life stages, supporting the hypothesis that CTmax closely approximates physiological death in these animals.     I also compared CTmax and metabolic responses to temperature among three wild populations of mosquitoes (Culex tarsalis) from varied climates. CTmax differed significantly across all three populations, correlating with average maximum temperatures at each locale. Metabolic rate (measured as CO2 production rate) differed significantly between cool- and warm-adapted populations. These results support the hypothesis that plasticity in thermal traits such as CTmax and metabolic rate enable the broad distribution of this species over diverse climates, and may also confer resilience to climate change.     Lastly, I investigated the physiological source of the large burst of CO2 released by insects after CTmax under sustained heating. The volume of this burst, or post-mortal peak (PMP), was significantly greater after death at high temperatures than the volume of CO2 released when insects were killed by squashing. The PMP was not produced in the absence of oxygen, nor was it altered by antibiotic ablation of gut bacteria. Our results suggest that the PMP results from active, aerobic metabolism by the insect cells after CTmax, due to breakdown of the inner mitochondrial membrane at high temperatures, which uncouples the mitochondria and produces large quantities of CO2.

T1  - Adaptive tolerance to ocean acidification in the marine sponge: <i> Chondrilla nucula</i>
AN  - 1033569099
AB  - The dramatic increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution has led to a 30% increase in ocean acidification over pre-industrial levels.  Although most ocean acidification research thus far has focused on calcifying organisms such as corals, the potential of this increase in acidity (H+ ions) to cause acid-base imbalances in soft-bodied animals such as sponges has been grossly overlooked.  Furthermore, many studies on ocean acidification have not considered the elevated temperatures that are predicted to accompany future climate change conditions. Sponges are crucial components to coral reef systems, providing food, nutrients, structure, and support. The sponge Chondrilla nucula is a common member of Caribbean coral reef communities, and is occasionally found in conditions exhibiting natural environmental hypercapnia, such as caves and dark portions of mangroves. We sought to test the hypothesis that such acclimation to acidic conditions in situ translates to a degree of tolerance to simulated near-future conditions of ocean acidification under laboratory conditions. In the summer of 2011, we conducted two experiments in the Exuma Cays, Bahamas, assessing the ability of Chondrilla nucula to adapt to “acidified”conditions. The first experiment examined sponges transplanted from a shallow reef site into a cave site (“Cave Hole”of variable pH (=8.2-7.7)), the reef immediately outside the cave (“Cave Reef ”(pH=8.2)), and back-transplanted to the reef of origin (“Control Site”(pH=8.2)).  Non-polar lipid fraction ratios increased significantly at the Cave Hole and Control sites, but not at the Cave Reef site.  However, total lipids increased at the Cave Reef site, while remaining unchanged at the Cave Hole and Control sites. Fluorescent yield, chlorophyll a, soluble protein, carbohydrate, refractory material, ash, and total energetic content were unchanged across the treatment sites, suggesting some acclimation to acidified conditions in the Cave Hole sponges after 2 months.  In a second experiment, we utilized a subset of the sponges from the field experiment to examine simulated near-future climate change effects of low pH and high temperature under laboratory conditions. There were no significant effects of treatment across all biochemical constituents except for ash, which showed a significant site temperature interaction. The only other significant effects observed were site effects on the Cave Reef sponges, most likely due to elevated irradiance or other conditions in the field.  These findings suggest that Chondrilla nucula is very tolerant of acidified conditions in the field and simulated near future conditions of ocean acidification and increased temperature.

T1  - Effect of cadmium and seasonality on critical temperatures of aerobic metabolism in eastern oysters, <i>Crassostrea virginica</i> Gmelin 1791
AN  - 1021198582
AB  - Cadmium (Cd) and elevated temperatures are common stressors in estuarine and coastal environments affecting intertidal mollusks such as oysters. Cd and elevated temperature can raise the metabolic demands of oysters due to the increase cost of detoxification and damage repair and induce tissue-wide hypoxemia. According to the concept of the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT), this is expected to lead to the shift of the critical temperature (Tc) of aerobic metabolism (indicated by the onset of partial anaerobiosis) restricting the thermal tolerance limits of the organism. We tested this hypothesis by determining the onset of anaerobic metabolism, changes in the cellular energy budget and the extent of oxidative damage during acute temperature rise (from 20°C to 36°C) in eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica under control conditions and after prolonged Cd exposure (50 µg Cd l -1 for 30 days). In summer and winter control oysters, levels of anaerobic end products increased at 28°C and 24°C, respectively, indicating an earlier onset of tissue hypoxemia in winter-acclimated oysters. Cd exposure shifted Tc to lower levels in summer oysters (from 28 to 24°C) oysters Tc was 24°C in summer However, in winter there was no temperature-induced accumulation of anaerobic end products in Cd-exposed oysters suggesting that the effect of Cd exposure on Tc varies between the seasons and/or that the studied range of temperatures was insufficient to detect Tc in the winter Cd-exposed group. Acute warming had no negative effects on tissue and cellular energy status of oysters in summer or winter but led to an increase of oxidative damage to proteins in winter control oysters. This suggests that oysters are well-adapted to acute temperature fluctuations in the intertidal zone and maintain energy balance despite the limitations of aerobic metabolism and partial transition to anaerobiosis.

T1  - Drought tolerance and implications for vegetation-climate interactions in the Amazon forest
AN  - 1019970296
AB  - On seasonal and annual timescales, the Amazon forest is resistant to drought, but more severe droughts can have profound effects on ecosystem productivity and tree mortality. The majority of climate models predict decreased rainfall in tropical South America over this century. Until recently, land surface models have not included mechanisms of forest resistance to seasonal drought. In some coupled climate models, the inability of tropical forest to withstand warming and drying leads to replacement of forest by savanna by 2050. The main questions of this research are: What factors affect forest drought tolerance, and what are the implications of drought tolerance mechanisms for climate?    Forest adaptations to drought, such as development of deep roots, enable Amazon forests to withstand seasonal droughts, and the maintenance of transpiration during dry periods can affect regional climate. At high levels of water stress, such as those imposed during a multiyear rainfall exclusion experiment or during interannual drought, trees prevent water loss by closing their stomata.    We examine forest response to drought in an ecosystem model (SiB3—the Simple Biosphere model) compared to two rainfall exclusion experiments in the Amazon. SiB3 best reproduces the observed drought response using realistic soil parameters and annual LAI, and by adjusting soil depth. SiB3's optimal soil depth at each site serves as a proxy for forest drought resistance. Based on the results at the exclusion sites, we form the hypothesis that forests with periodic dry conditions are more adapted to drought.    We parameterize stress resistance as a function of precipitation climatology, soil texture, and percent forest cover. The parameterization impacts carbon and moisture fluxes during extreme drought events. The loss of productivity is of similar magnitude as plot-based measurements of biomass loss during the 2005 drought.    Changing stress resistance in SiB3 also affects surface evapotranspiration during dry periods, which has the potential to affect climate through changing sensible and latent heat fluxes. We examine the effects of forest stress resistance on climate through coupled experiments of SiB3 in a GCM. In a single column model, we find evidence for a more active hydrologic cycle due to increased stress resistance. The boundary layer responds through changes in its depth, relative humidity, and turbulent kinetic energy, and the changes feed back to influence wet season onset and intensity. In a full global GCM, increased stress resistance often decreases drought intensity through enhanced ET and changes to circulation. The circulation responds to changes in atmospheric latent heating and can affect precipitation in the South Atlantic Convergence Zone.

T1  - Climate-driven shifts in host-parasite interactions: Consequences for parasite transmission and host pathology
AN  - 1017526102
AB  - Interspecific differences in climate-driven changes to organismal physiology and phenology will alter the timing and consequence of many ecological interactions.  The extent to which such changes may exacerbate or ameliorate disease risk is increasingly controversial.  I used a combination of laboratory and field studies to simultaneously test both direct (i.e., physiological) and indirect (i.e., interspecific interactions) effects of climate change on disease using the parasite, Ribeiroia ondatrae, and its hosts as a model system.  Ribeiroia is transmitted sequentially from snails to amphibians to birds, and when amphibians are infected early in development, they are more likely to die or become deformed.  Because parasite development is enhanced by elevated temperatures while amphibian breeding is jointly constrained by temperature and rainfall, I hypothesized that climate change could lead to greater infection of tadpoles at earlier stages of development, causing elevated pathology.  By infecting snails at different temperatures in the laboratory, I found that higher temperatures accelerated parasite development and amplified snail pathology (via reduced egg output), but also decreased snail survival time.  Similarly, in amphibians, parasite infectivity (host penetration) was enhanced, but establishment (encystment), persistence, and survival outside the host declined with rising temperature.  There was a mid-temperature peak in deformities, likely resulting from increases in parasite infectivity with temperature coupled with reductions in host vulnerability owing to faster development.  My field survey revealed a negative association between evaporation and the density of infected snails as well as amphibian infection intensity (independently of the snail effect), likely due to reduced host and parasite survival and production at sites subjected to drying.  After accounting for  Ribeiroia infection intensity, amphibian deformities were also positively correlated with nutrients, suggesting a potential effect of eutrophication on host tolerance or parasite virulence.  Different aspects of climate change will thus act to enhance infection in some ways, but hinder it in others, suggesting that future research into climate-disease interactions should use a combination of field and laboratory studies that focus on potential nonlinearities between climate and disease risk, shifting host-parasite interactions, and abiotic changes beyond temperature.

T1  - Tree regeneration dynamics and drivers across the temperate-boreal transition zone
AN  - 1009077527
AB  - The upper Great Lakes region in central North America contains a forest transition zone where temperate and boreal tree species reach their northern and southern range limits, respectively. It is only within this narrow latitudinal band (∼3 degrees), that relatively warm-adapted temperate and cold-adapted boreal tree species are found growing together in upland mesic sites.  If climate is a main driver of forest dynamics within this region, recent and predicted climate change should result in major forest shifts, including the expansion of temperate species and range contraction of boreal species. Such changes should first be manifest in growth and abundance trends of tree species in the understory regeneration layers. In addition to climate, numerous other factors such as overstory composition, understory abiotic environment, competition with shrub and herbaceous layers, and browse pressure drive tree regeneration trends. Interrelationships and interactions among these drivers will ultimately determine the direction and rate of forest change. We explored these research topics through field studies of naturally established seedlings and saplings at 124 upland mesic forest sites across a three state (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan U.S.A) 170,000 km2 area of the temperate-boreal transition zone.     Chapter 1 examined relative abundance shifts of temperate and boreal tree regeneration at two spatial scales: local ecotonal boundaries between temperate and boreal dominated stands and across the regional temperate-boreal transition zone. Because we compared understory performance across locally changing overstory composition, we calculated species regeneration success as the difference in relative abundance between the understory and overstory layers. At the local scale, both shade-tolerant temperate and boreal species exhibited positive tree regeneration success across ecotonal boundaries. However, across the region, regeneration performance varied with mean summer temperature and to a lesser extent mean annual precipitation. Changes in regeneration success were generally greatest at the warm end of the transition zone, with temperate broadleaf Acer saccharum, Fraxinus nigra, and  Ostrya virginiana responding positively and boreal Abies balsamea showing significantly reduced performance. For the most frequent temperate species, Acer rubrum, regeneration success was greatest in boreal neighborhoods and at cool and dry sites. Other species did not exhibit detectable shifts in regeneration success, potentially due to traits such as shade-tolerance, palatability, and mode of reproduction. Overall we found that numerous tree species growing across the temperate-boreal transition zone are likely sensitive to climate at early stages of development, with observed shifts in regeneration success concomitant with the direction predicted in response to climate change.      Chapter 2 assessed the relative importance of and interrelationships among explanatory variable sets in explaining the composition of the tree regeneration layer. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) and variation partitioning to quantify the unique, shared, and total explanatory power of four sets of drivers: climate, understory abiotic environment, overstory composition, and understory biota. The results showed that all four driver sets individually explained a significant portion of tree regeneration compositional variation and additionally that there were strong relationships among explanatory variables. Overstory composition, which directly influences seed availability and also was found to be closely associated with understory environmental conditions and biota, had approximately twice the explanatory power of any of the other three driver sets. Some of the strongest individual drivers were overstory  Acer saccharum and Populus tremuloides, soil pH, mean summer temperature, and mean annual precipitation. Suites of associated drivers included cool, moist, sandy, and acidic conditions; overstory boreal broadleaf species, light availability, shrub abundance, and forb cover; and warm temperatures and graminoid cover. Due to the strong interrelationships among drivers, the direction and rate of forest change will likely depend on how the importance of drivers shifts with climate and, for the biotic drivers, on the rate and magnitude of their own responses to climate change.     Chapter 3 investigated sapling height and radial growth rates of five temperate and boreal species. This study included over 1700 stems of naturally established, competing saplings growing at 14 sites across the temperate-boreal transition zone. Top performing linear mixed-effects models typically included two-way interactions among mean summer temperature, browse pressure, understory light levels, and initial sapling size. As hypothesized, temperate sapling growth increased and boreal growth decreased with increasing temperatures. However, the relative performance of competing species shifted depending on the level of browse pressure. Positive temperate growth responses to temperature were eliminated by heavy browse pressure, tilting growth rates in favor of less palatable boreal conifers at all but the warmest sites. Spatial variations in browse pressure levels across the region suggest that temperate expansion may proceed most rapidly in areas where browsing is least intense. Growth responses to temperature also varied with sapling size and, for the least shade-tolerant species in the study, Quercus rubra, light availability. Enhanced growth by temperate species in response to warmer temperatures was most detectable under favorable conditions including low browse pressure and high understory light availability, suggesting that any efforts to facilitate forest compositional changes will need to take into account these trends.

T1  - Evolution of Thermal Tolerance and Mating Systems in Two Intertidal Crustaceans
AN  - 908981530
AB  - Intertidal invertebrates provide a wealth of opportunities for testing hypotheses in evolution and ecology, as the group encompasses a broad variety of body plans, life histories, and ecologies. In this dissertation I address two themes in two different intertidal crustaceans: the evolution of thermal tolerance, and the evolution of animal mating systems. In the first two chapters, I present the results of a series of selection experiments, measuring thermal tolerance and the capacity to evolve increased tolerance in the tidepool copepod Tigriopus californicus. A rich history of intertidal ecology on the west coast of North America demonstrates that temperature and desiccation stress play important roles setting species' distributions. In addition, thermal tolerance limits are likely to mediate species' responses to climate change. In the third chapter, I present the first use (to my knowledge) of molecular data to assign paternity in a barnacle (Tetraclita rubescens ), and use these data to describe the species' mating system.   The extent to which acclimation and genetic adaptation might buffer natural populations against climate change is largely unknown. Most models predicting biological responses to environmental change assume that species' climatic envelopes are homogeneous both in space and time. Although recent discussions have questioned this assumption, few empirical studies have characterized intraspecific patterns of genetic variation in traits directly related to environmental tolerance limits. I test the extent of such variation in the broadly distributed tidepool copepod Tigriopus californicus using laboratory rearing and selection experiments to quantify thermal tolerance and scope for adaptation in eight populations spanning more than 17° of latitude. Tigriopus californicus exhibit striking local adaptation to temperature, with less than 1 per cent of the total quantitative variance for thermal tolerance partitioned within populations. Moreover, heat-tolerant phenotypes observed in low-latitude populations cannot be achieved in high-latitude populations, either through acclimation or 10 generations of strong selection. Finally, in four populations there was no increase in thermal tolerance between generations 5 and 10 of selection, suggesting that standing variation had already been depleted.   Limits to adaptation often arise from negative pleiotropic effects of alleles under selection. To measure possible costs of thermal tolerance, I measure six fitness-related traits in selected and unselected lines: male size, female size, fecundity, interbrood interval, minimum generation time and starvation resistance. However, there is no evidence for a cost of increased tolerance. Although five out of six of these populations show a response to selection, selected lines actually show an overall increase in male and female body size, fecundity and starvation resistance. The effect of selection on correlated traits also varies significantly by population for three traits, providing evidence that the genetic basis for the response to selection differs among populations.   Plasticity and adaptation appear to have limited capacity to buffer isolated populations of T. californicus against further increases in temperature. However, my results suggest that genetic variation for thermal tolerance within populations is not limited by a linear tradeoff between tolerance and other aspects of fitness. It may instead by limited by forces such as drift, or negative epistatic interactions among thermal tolerance alleles from different populations.   In the third chapter, I use molecular markers to assign paternity to broods of the intertidal barnacle Tetraclita rubescens. I use these data to describe this species' mating system, and factors affecting paternity success. A paired logistic regression shows no effect of body size or male investment on paternity success, while the effect of proximity is highly significant. Tetraclita is capable of siring broods over distances of 11.2 cm, but broods show low rates of multiple paternity, with 75% of broods having only one father, even at high densities. Siring success is evenly distributed among individuals, with a distribution of successes/barnacle at high densities that is not significantly different from the null expectation of equal probability of success among all individuals, and a distribution that was more even than the null expectation at low densities. High rates of single-paternity broods suggest that this species does not compete via sperm displacement and this may explain the lack of any relationship between male investment and paternity success. Furthermore a lack of any skew in the distribution of paternity successes suggests a lack of strong sexual selection on male traits in this species, a fact that is likely driven by the small size of mating groups available to a sessile copulator.

T1  - Development and Evaluation of a Dynamic, Mechanistic, Thermal Balance Model for <i>Bos indicus</i> and <i>Bos taurus</i>
AN  - 908848764
AB  - Cattle are subject to heat stress in both the temperate and tropic climates. Heat stress impacts animal well-being and results in decreased production, which leads to economic losses for livestock producers. Despite the impact of heat stress on livestock production, quantitative evaluation of mitigation measures is complicated, due to the difficulty in defining and quantifying heat stress and the limited availability of dynamic, mechanistic models for cattle. This thesis presents the development and evaluation of a heat balance model to better understand heat stress in cattle. The process included the following steps: quantifying all of the thermal flows within the animal and between the animal and its environment, quantifying the effect of the breed types Bos indicus and Bos taurus on the thermal flows, testing and fitting sweating and respiration rate equations, conducting three sensitivity analyses to examine all of the model parameters, and evaluating the model under different climate conditions.     The heat balance model was created by applying thermodynamic principles and statistical equations which describe physiological responses of animals. The inputs for the model are climate data (which are easily obtainable for virtually any location with a weather station) and animal parameters (body weight, diet composition and breed-type parameters). The sweating and respiration rate equations were fit to the breed types B. indicus,  B. taurus and crossbreds, as a function of skin and body temperature, respectively. A newly developed sweating rate equation, when tested against existing equations, was a better fit for B. taurus and crossbreds, whereas an existing equation developed by Gatenby was a better fit for  B. indicus.     Evaluation of the heat balance model showed that out of the 24 model parameters, the 6 most important parameters (which relate directly to blood flow to the skin, sweating and respiration rates, intake and air temperature) explained 79.4% to 89.2% of the model variation. This suggests that research should focus on measuring these parameters whereas the others need only approximate estimations.      The model accurately predicts the relationship between body and skin temperatures as well as sweating and respiration rates. In addition, the model accurately predicts the rise in body temperature, with the rise in air temperature, but the lag in this rise was difficult to estimate due to limited temporal information in the data. The effect of solar radiation, resulting in a rise in body temperature, was over-predicted by the model. Research measuring the effect of solar radiation on cattle would greatly contribute to understanding this flow and improve model predictions. Overall, the heat balance model performed well and is a useful tool for understanding and quantifying heat stress in cattle.

T1  - Characteristics Contributing to Invasiveness of the Asian Shore Crab, <i>Hemigrapsus sanguineus</i>
AN  - 906295032
AB  - In the marine environment, unique challenges directly impact an invasive species' establishment, including salinity preference and tolerance, ability to find food, utilization of shelter and space, response to mates, and avoidance of competition and predation. By quantifying these factors, one can predict where a potential newly introduced invader could become established and develop management strategies to curb its spread in the new area.    In data collected in Rhode Island, spatial patterning of Hemigrapsus sanguineus changes with season, showing increased aggregation during winter months in the intertidal zone. In laboratory trials, preference for intermediate-sized rock shelter persists in H. sanguineus regardless of temperature, with a specific preference for larger rock, which is consistent with limb loss patterns.    To test the cohabitation response of adult H. sanguineus to conspecific and heterospecific (green crab Carcinus maenas), we quantified presence of H. sanguineus in artificial shelters deployed intertidally and subtidally in Long Island Sound (CT), replicated in the laboratory, and determined interspecifc and intraspecific competition of crabs of different carapace size ratios in the laboratory. H. sanguineus  avoided likely competitors, as did other benthic species in the community of either the H. sanguineus or C. maenas  treatment. Laboratory direct competition trials show H. sanguineus uses shelter more often than its competitor, and is more likely to cohabitate with conspecifics.    H. sanguineus tolerates a wider range of salinities and is more likely to adequately defend shelter from competitors within the mid and upper intertidal. H. sanguineus shows low mortality across a broad range of salinities, has little change in hemolymph osmolality and Na/K ATPase activity over a short-term salinity shock, and behaviorally distinguishes between salinities when presented with a choice, regardless of acclimation salinity.    The combination of the effects of the behavioral dominance of  H. sanguineus for shelter with its ability to withstand salinity changes give it a unique ability to maintain valuable intertidal shelter from predators and competitors during changes in tides and freshwater events, and make it a more efficient invader by allowing it to gain a foothold early in its life cycle and persist.

T1  - The influence of environmental temperature on the thermal tolerance of antarctic notothenioid fishes
AN  - 901254498
AB  - The evolution of the Antarctic notothenioid fishes in the chronically cold waters of the Southern Ocean has resulted in a remarkably narrow thermal tolerance shared among most extant species. While most of these fishes have the capacity to accommodate the physiological challenges of low temperature, they show a greatly reduced tolerance to heat relative to fishes native to warmer waters. Though predominantly distributed in the Southern Ocean, today the Antarctic notothenioids are largely divided by their geographic distributions between three regionally endemic ichthyofaunas in the high-latitude High Antarctic Zone (HAZ), the lower-latitude Seasonal Pack-ice Zone, and cold-temperate waters of southern South America and the South Island of New Zealand. However, the extent to which regional differences in ice abundance and temperature affect the thermal tolerance of their endemic fishes is poorly understood.   Within the Southern Ocean the Antarctic notothenioids are largely split between the constantly freezing High-Antarctic Zone (HAZ) and the more thermally variable Seasonal pack-Ice Zone (SPZ). For these fishes, the lower boundary of their thermal tolerance is effectively determined by their capacity for freeze avoidance and limited by their circulating levels of antifreeze proteins (AFPs). To investigate the differences in freeze avoidance between these regions' endemic ichthyofaunas blood serum freezing points were measured in 11 of the 14 species of the Antarctic icefishes (family Channichthyidae). While the icefishes are a small monophyletic group within the suborder Notothenioidei, they mirror the larger group's divisions in geographic distribution and lifestyle making this family a useful system for understanding the larger group. Within this family, blood serum freezing point was negatively correlated with the latitude of species' geographic distributions with the three SPZ species showing the highest freezing points. Either equal to or higher than the freezing point of seawater, these serum freezing points left the SPZ species with insufficient protection from freezing to survive in the ice-laden waters inhabited by the HAZ species. When the contributions to freeze avoidance of serum osmolytes, antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs), and the antifreeze potentiating protein was assessed, the higher freeze avoidance of high-latitude HAZ icefishes was found to result predominantly from increasing antifreeze activity from the AFGPs.   The reduced severity of some SPZ habitats which allows the survival of species with high freezing points may also be reflected in the development of notothenioid freeze avoidance during ontogeny. While prior work on larval  Gymnodraco acuticeps has shown that HAZ notothenioids can reach adult levels of serum antifreeze activity within months of hatching, antifreeze activity has never been previously studied in any of the SPZ species. To do so, I investigated the freeze avoidance in juveniles of the high freezing point SPZ icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus which had the highest serum freezing point among the adult Antarctic icefishes. These maintained sub-adult levels of serum antifreeze activity through the 2+ year class, which were the oldest collected, and if the observed rate of increase was sustained they would not attain adult levels of antifreeze activity until 4.2 years after hatching.   Though most of the Antarctic notothenioids share low freezing points, the absence of selection for heat tolerance in the chronically cold Southern Ocean has over evolutionary time resulted in their modern limited heat tolerance. To determine whether differences in environmental temperature between the HAZ and SPZ are also correlated with the heat tolerance of regionally endemic fishes, the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) was determined in 11 species of Antarctic fishes including six from the HAZ and five from the SPZ. Like freeze avoidance, heat tolerance among the Antarctic fishes could be separated according to their geographic distribution with the CTMaxs of five of the HAZ species significantly below those of the SPZ species when acclimatized to their natural freezing water temperatures. However, while these shared low heat tolerances in the eight species available in numbers allowing further study, all retained plasticity in their heat tolerance with significant and often proportionally large increases in CTMax following warm acclimation to 4°C.   The Antarctic notothenioids also include at least 16 secondarily temperate species with origins in Antarctic waters but that are now permanent residents of the warmer waters around New Zealand and South America. Presumably these once shared the limited heat tolerance found currently among endemic Antarctic fishes however, it is not known whether this polar trait continues to exert an influence on their modern heat tolerance. To investigate, I determined the CTMax in two species of New Zealand notothenioids, the secondarily temperate  N. angustata and the basal thorn fish Bovichtus variegatus  that does not share the former's evolutionary origins in polar waters but which inhabits a similar modern thermal environment. While N. angustata had significantly higher heat tolerance than its endemic Antarctic congener N. coriiceps, it showed significantly lower heat tolerance than B. variegatus, suggesting the continued presence of its presumed ancestral loss of heat tolerance.   These studies showed species' levels of freeze avoidance and heat tolerance are not homogeneous throughout the Antarctic notothenioids, but reflect regional differences even within the Southern Ocean where water temperatures range only between -1.9 and 3°C. Freeze avoidance was lowest among species restricted to the more northerly waters of the SPZ where they presumably survive in the perennially ice free waters found within this region, but which also likely limits their distributions to waters outside the more severe HAZ. The relaxed selection for freeze avoidance in some SPZ waters also allows for the slow onset of adult antifreeze activity in at least one species of icefish,  C. aceratus. Similarly, while the Antarctic notothenioids largely share low heat tolerances when acclimatized to their natural freezing water temperatures, these show notable regional variation and a surprisingly high level of plasticity in response to warm acclimation. However, the comparably limited levels of heat tolerance in the secondarily temperate nototheniid,  N. angustata, suggests that there may be substantial retention of its ancestral low heat tolerance which may impairing the Antarctic notothenioid’s ability to adapt to the rising water temperatures predicted from global climate change.

T1  - Ecological adaptations and transcriptome evolution of the malaria mosquito <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>
AN  - 898609137
AB  - Anopheles gambiae has adapted to flourish in spatially diverse ecological conditions, from the humid rainforests to arid Sahel savannas. Within a region, An. gambiae is capable of surviving considerable temporal fluctuations in rainfall and temperature. This extraordinary adaptive flexibility of An. gambiae is largely attributed to complex chromosomal inversion polymorphisms. In addition, An. gambiae is subject to an ongoing incipient speciation process that also appears strongly associated with adaptive phenotypic traits. A long-standing goal is to identify genomic regions/genes/pathways involved in both evolutionary processes.    With the intent of exploring the genetic basis of adaptive phenotypes associated with both the nascent speciation process and chromosomal inversion polymorphisms, we focus on transcriptome evolution because there is increasing empirical support that gene regulation contributes to adaptive/species differences; and the lack of discrete phenotypic differences between M and S precludes using powerful quantitative techniques that require such  a priori information (e.g., QTL mapping). Transcription profiles can unravel phenotypes not readily visible via these approaches, thereby providing novel insights into the divergence.    Chapter 2 reports on the 2La chromosomal inversion, which is strongly linked to degree of aridity in Africa. Gene expression profiles were generated at three time points following acute heat exposure.    In Chapter 3, global oligonucleotide arrays were employed to search for transcriptome variation at key developmental stages most likely associated with the speciation.    Chapter 4 extended the virgin female time point to include six additional time points and corresponding mated females across a two hour window encompassing dusk. Ten candidate genes linked to olfaction were targeted.    Because premating behavioral isolation involves the interaction between trait and preference in different sexes, corresponding reproductively active virgin male global expression was profiled in chapter 5.    Chapter 6 explores the relationship between molecular form transcriptome variation and degree of swarm segregation in nuptial males and females from Mali and Burkina Faso.    Chapter 7 focuses on the ecological segregation between M and S. Specifically, the divergence in larval breeding habitats in southern Cameroon, where M occupies polluted urbanized habitats. Transplantation experiments explored the genetic basis of M form larval tolerance to the environmental stressors in their habitats.

T1  - Molecular Mechanisms of Precise and Robust Gene Regulation in Drosophila
AN  - 892713628
AB  - The ornate arrangement of diverse cells into specialized tissues, organs, and higher structures characteristic of multicellular organisms is all encoded from the same genome sequence.  Despite their differences, morphologically distinct cells (e.g. muscle cells and neurons) must transcribe many of the same genes.  Morphological indistinguishable cells must often transcribe distinct sets of genes (e.g. different odorant receptor cells).  The ensemble of genes expressed in a given cell—and the relative frequency they are expressed at, give each cell its characteristic identity more so than the presence of individual genes.  Therefore understanding the genetic control of development and differentiation is a question not so much of the understanding the gene sequences themselves, but the regulatory structure of the genome which determines how they are deployed.     In order for development to unravel in such a manner that each embryo makes it through the process with all the correct parts in the correct positions at the end, this process must be exceedingly precise.  Though often taken for granted, this precision becomes particular impressive if one considers the frequency with which mistakes are made in intelligently designed human built assembly processes.  The developing animal must position components correctly on scales of microns (e.g. tissue boundaries) and nanometers (e.g. neuron-junctions), has no external direction of assembly, and requires thermal noise to position many of its components (including essentially all transcription factors—proteins which regulate read access to the genome).       It is not sufficient for the process to be precise.  It must also be robust to changes in the conditions in which it operates, such as different thermal environments, nutrient conditions, and chemical environments.  This robustness enables a certain degree of plasticity, such that some components of the system can change and evolve new functions, without causing catastrophic failure of the rest of the system.        In my thesis research I have tried to explore some of the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation which support the precise and robust expression of multicellular genomes.  Rapid advances in post-genomic technologies have exposed a broad range of fundamental differences in the organization and regulation of multicellular genomes such as Drosophila.  I have worked primarily on two phenomena, the use of promoter proximal pausing as a regulatory strategy, and the use of multiple apparently redundant regulatory sequences to drive expression of the same gene.  Discovery of both of these phenomena emerged from analysis of whole genome polymerase and transcription factor binding data.  Using quantitative high resolution in situ and semi-automated computational image processing I have studied the detailed differences in the transcriptional activation and transcription frequency of genes regulated by these mechanisms.  Through this analysis I have shown a strong correlation through more rapid and synchronous gene expression and regulation through release of promoter proximal paused polymerase.  Theoretical modeling demonstrates that such an effect can be expected from regulating release of stable downstream state in a general assembly process (such as construction of the RNA Pol II pre-initiation complex).     Analysis of gene expression driven by multiple enhancers with overlapping activity compared to constructs with only a single active enhancer revealed that the process by which an enhancer binds its target transcription factors and activates expression is often limiting enough that having a second independent copy can produce detectable changes in the frequency of transcription.  This reduction of natural variation in gene activation is especially important under stress conditions, such as thermal stress or reduced levels of some of the activating factors.  Robustness to this sort of variation may be important both for adaptation within a species and the flexibility to allow modification of interacting pathways in the course of evolutionary modification.  These investigations also revealed a corrective propensity whereby the simultaneous activity of multiple enhancers, responding to repressors as well as activators, can give rise to correctly restricted gene expression even when the elements taken in isolation drive some degree of ectopic expression.       So far both of these mechanisms have only been reliably documented in multicellular systems, suggesting that the precision and robustness they confer may be an innovation of metazoans in response to increased levels of coordination required to keep many cells functioning in the tight cooperation of a multicellular organism.  Doubtless this is but scratching the surface of the mechanisms which ensure such precision and control.  However the rapid improvements to both genomic tools and imaging technology make it like to be a promising field for further exploration for years to come.

T1  - An individualized human thermoregulation model
AN  - 868866341
AB  - Models of human thermoregulation and heat transfer date have been developed for a wide range of applications. Many existing models are of limited usefulness in asymmetric thermal environments, such as may be encountered during an EVA. A further limitation is that models based on a standard man model are not readily scalable to represent large or small subjects.   This work describes development of a new human thermal model derived from the 41-node Man Model and Fiala Model. Each segment consists of geometrical shapes made up of layers of the appropriate tissue types. These segments are connected only by the flow of blood from a central blood pool to each part.    Scaling rules are developed to enable simulation of small and large subjects. Results show the model simulates core and surface temperature histories, sweat evaporation and metabolic rates which generally are consistent with controlled exposures of human subjects.

T1  - Research and comparison about some characteristics of gift strain of nile tilapia (oreochromis niloticus) and paradise fish (macropodus opercularis) under different temperatures
AN  - 1873866589
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorTemperature has comprehensive and profound effects on fish from macroscopic levels such as performance to microscopic levels such as cell and molecule. It contains physiology, motion, membrane fluidity, material transport, and the activities of membrane proteins and so on. First, we detected and compared the extreme temperature tolerance of GIFT strain of Nile tilapia and paradise fish with a controllable ecosystem and a series of scientific index such as curve of survival rate, TAD, CDH and LD50. We also observed and recorded the performance of these two fishes under different temperatures. And then, we studied the effects of temperature on a series of functions of membrane. In terms of membrane fluidity, the results showed that the membrane fluidity of both fishes increased as temperature reduced during the acute chilling. It indicted the complemented fluidification in the cell membrane. Moreover, the rate of change of membrane fluidity in GIFT strain of Nile tilapia was relatively bigger than paradise fish, which indicted the relative poor ability of adjustment in tilapia. In respect of endocytosis, the results showed that the hepatocytes of paradise fish can keep steady rate under low and high temperatures. The rates significantly increased in high temperature and reduced in low temperature in tilapia. when it comes to exocytosis, the results showed that the rates did not significantly change in paradise fish either under high or low temperature, while they changed obviously in tilapia near the extreme temperatures. The combined results about endocytosis and exocytosis implied that the rate of material transport in tilapia is more sensitive than in paradise fish. It also indicted that paradise fish can keep steady rate of material transport near extreme temperatures. The rate of material transport is significantly different between the hardy species (paradise fish) and the non-hardy species (GIFT strain of Nile tilapia). The extent and tendency of changes in membrane fluidity and material transport are accordant in each species, which implied the importance of membrane fluidity among factors influencing the rate of material transport. With regard to the activity of membrane proteins, we chose Na+,K+-ATPase, the marker enzyme of the plasma membrane as our subject. The results showed that the hepatocytes of paradise fish which had better ability in adjusting membrane fluidity can maintain 79.4 percent activity of Na+,K+-ATPase under low temperature (12℃) comparing to room temperature (25℃), while the same parameter is 72.3 percent in GIFT strain of Nile tilapia which had relatively poor ability in adjusting membrane fluidity. The rate of change is significantly different between the activities Na+,K+-ATPase in the hardy species (paradise fish) and the non-hardy species (GIFT strain of Nile tilapia). The extent and tendency of changes in membrane fluidity and activity of Na+,K+-ATPase were accordant in each species, which implied the importance of membrane fluidity among factors influencing the activity of membrane proteins. In sum, all the physiological functions related to cell membrane in this study are sensitive to temperature, and these sensitivities are significantly different between the hardy species (paradise fish) and the non-hardy species (GIFT strain of Nile tilapia). In each species, the extent and tendency of these sensitivities under different temperatures are accordant. All the differences in cellular level are accordant with the macroscopic temperature tolerance. All the results indicted that the importance of steady membrane fluidity in cold tolerance of fishes. It implied that the poor ability of adjusting membrane fluidity may be one of the factors contributing to GIFT strain of Nile tilapia's poor cold tolerance. During the acclimation of these species, enhancing their ability of adjusting membrane fluidity, or identifying hardy species with such ability as one of the measurement indicators, are both very promising solutions, which are expected to cope with physiological barriers such as dysfunction of osmotic pressure and dysbolism under cold

T1  - The effects of environmental conditions on tolerance to malathion in bruchid beetles (coleoptera: bruchidae)
AN  - 1800138361
AB  - Bruchid beetles are economically important pests of grain legumes. Their medium to high level infestation is being controlled with insecticide. This study investigated the effects of environmental factors such as temperature, toxicant concentration, food and bruchid geographical strain on malathion tolerance in Callosobruchus species (c. maculatus, C. chinensis and C. rhodesianus). There were variations in insecticide tolerance among the species and C. maculatus which is the most widely spread and known showed the highest tolerance. Geographical origin had a pronounced impact on the response of C. maculatus to malathion. There was a positive relationship between temperature effect and bruchid susceptibility to malathion as often observed with organophosphate. The impact of food on insecticide tolerance in Callosobruchus was quite unpredictable. Overall, the interactive effects of all the factors are very complex. An alteration of anyone factor could either enhance or reduce tolerance. This could be driven by bruchid ancestry or fitness cost. Biochemical pathway study with malaoxon (malathion metabolite) ruled out acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as primarily responsible for malathion tolerance in bruchids; though it could be an additional factor to other tolerance mechanisms. However, there was variation in AChE activity among the species and strains with influence from the rearing food. Preliminary screening of the bruchids for the endosymbiont Wolbachia, prior to studies on its effect on insecticide tolerance was undertaken. The study revealed a high probable presence of this organism in C. maculatus and C. rhodesianus, which were previously thought to be non-host species. The implication of these findings in order to optimize bruchid management especially with insecticides to avoid/combat the development of insecticide resistance is discussed. This includes the impacts on legume breeding, production, transportation and storage.

T1  - Effects of Methoprene on <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)
AN  - 1506165770
AB  - Due to concerns with synthetic neurotoxic insecticides used in insect pest management, alternative control methods are sought. Methoprene is a juvenile hormone analogue, which is well-known for its lethal effects on immature insects, and is registered as a stored-grain insecticide in the U.S.A. and Australia. However, less is known about its sub-lethal effects. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of methoprene (Diacon II) on heat tolerance, cold tolerance and progeny production of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) when late-instar larvae or adults were exposed to wheat treated with methoprene. Methoprene at 3.33 ppm or higher, reduced heat tolerance of adults at 46ºC. In contrast, methoprene did not affect the heat tolerance of larvae. Cold tolerance and cold acclimation of both adults and larvae was not affected by methoprene. Exposure of larvae to 0.001 or 0.0165 ppm of methoprene on wheat had 37 and 72% reduction in adult emergence, respectively. The surviving adults had normal movement, but their progeny production was reduced by 71%. Males were affected more than females. Exposure of adults to methoprene (66.6 ppm) did not reduce progeny production. Methoprene is used as a surface treatment to control insects in empty grain bins, processing facilities and warehouses. Experiments were conducted to assess the effect of surface material, temperature and cleaning practices on methoprene residual efficacy. A bioassay with late-instar larvae at 30ºC until adult emergence was used to measure methoprene residual efficacy. Methoprene applied at the label rate (0.0003 mg/cm2 ) on varnished wood, held at 20, 30 or 35ºC for 24 weeks, prevented all development of larvae into adults. Conversely, concrete surfaces allowed 22% adult emergence after 8 weeks and 69% after 24 weeks. Temperatures, 20, 30 or 35ºC, that the concrete surfaces were held before the bioassay, did not affect this decline in efficacy. Presence of flour or repeated removal of flour (cleaning) reduced the efficacy of methoprene on concrete surfaces, but not on varnished wood. Maintaining concrete surfaces at 65ºC for 48 hours did not reduce efficacy. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of controlling stored-product insects, as well as insect physiology.

T1  - The role of haemocyanin in mediating responses to hypoxia in the signal crayfish pacifastacus leniusculus
AN  - 1415341462
AB  - Ectothermic animals may respond to environmental hypoxia by moving to cooler environments, exhibiting hypoxia induced behavioural hypothermia (HIBH). One benefit of hypothermia is the concomitant lowering of O2 demand, preserving internal partial pressure of O2 (P02) and delaying internal hypoxia. However, thermal acclimation may remove any such benefits. The macro-invertebrate Pacifastacus leniusculus was used as a model organism in which to clarify the role of haemocyanin in mediating responses to hypoxia. Quantifying the functioning of He is fundamental in understanding its importance in transducing environmental hypoxia. The role of temperature in influencing He 02-affinity was examined in crayfish acclimated to SOC, 13°C or 20°C. Increasing the temperature decreased the 02-affinity of He, regardless of acclimation history of the crayfish. The response of He Oy-affinity to variations in L-Iactate, urate, calcium and magnesium concentrations in the haemolymph were quantified as regulators of 02-binding. Effects of modulators in vitro were modelled to aid in the interpretation of He function in vivo; L- lactate was only found to potentiate He O2 binding at YC, however, urate, Ca and Mg all potentiated He 02-affinity, although this was temperature dependent for Ca. The in vivo functioning of He was assessed by determining the arterial and venous content and partial pressures of O2 and CO2, along with pH of haemolymph from crayfish exposed to progressive hypoxia of 9 mm Hg for 24hrs. Crayfish exhibited a tolerance to sustained hypoxia for 24hrs. The behavioural response of P. leniusculus inside a hypoxic thermal gradient was also investigated and found that it did not exhibit HIBH. However, evidence shows P. leniusculus was utilising anaerobic respiration demonstrated by increased haemolymph L-Iactate and glucose concentrations measured after hypoxic exposure. Therefore the response of P. leniusculus to hypoxia was first hyperventilation resulting in respiratory alkalosis, followed by anaerobiosis. ii

T1  - Overwintering survival of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa): Proteins associated with low temperature stress tolerance during cold acclimation in cultivars
AN  - 1015621299
AB  - Winter survival is variable among commercially grown strawberry ( Fragaria × ananassa) cultivars. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the molecular basis that contribute to this difference in strawberry cultivars and to identify potential biomarkers that can be used to facilitate the development of new strawberry cultivars with improved overwintering hardiness. With these goals in mind, the freezing tolerance was examined for four cultivars, ‘Jonsok’, ‘Senga Sengana’, ‘Elsanta’, and ‘Frida’ (listed from most to least freezing tolerant based on survival from physiological freezing experiments) and the protein expression was investigated in the overwintering relevant crown structure of strawberry. Biomarker selection was based on comparing the protein profiles from the most cold-tolerant cultivar, ‘Jonsok’ with the least cold-tolerant cultivar ‘Frida’ in a comprehensive investigation using two label-free global proteomic methods, shotgun and two dimensional electrophoresis, with support from univariate and multivariate analysis. A total of 143 proteins from shotgun and 64 proteins from 2DE analysis were identified as significantly differentially expressed between ‘Jonsok’ and ‘Frida’ at one or more time points during the cold treatment (0, 2, and 42 days at 2 ºC). These proteins included molecular chaperones, antioxidants/detoxifying enzymes, metabolic enzymes, pathogenesis related proteins and flavonoid pathway proteins. The proteins that contributed to the greatest differences between ‘Jonsok’ and ‘Frida’ are candidates for biomarker development. The novel and significant aspects of this work include the first crown proteome 2DE map with general characteristics of the strawberry crown proteome, a list of potential biomarkers to facilitate the development of new strawberry cultivars with improved cold stress tolerance.

T1  - Effectiveness of local cooling on enhancing tissue ischemia tolerance in people with spinal cord injury
AN  - 858199228
AB  - People with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at risk of pressure ulcer development due to impaired mobility, sensation or changes in tissue properties. Increased skin temperature is one of the least explored risk factors for pressure ulcers. Since people with SCI also encounter thermoregulation deficits, investigation of the effectiveness of local skin cooling in this population is particularly important. Three groups of subjects were recruited: 1) 14 subjects with SCI at T6 and above, 2) 8 subjects with SCI below T6, and 3) 14 healthy controls. Reactive hyperemic response was the main study outcome and was measured after three different combinations of stimuli: 1) pressure only, 2) pressure with fast cooling (−4°C/min) and 3) pressure with slow cooling (−0.33°C/min). Spectral density of the skin blood flow (SBF) was used to investigate the underlying microcirculatory control mechanisms. Five of the subjects did not have reactive hyperemia in all test sessions and were excluded from statistical analysis. In the control group, the normalized peak SBF and perfusion area were close to significantly greater in pressure only as compared to fast cooling (p=0.023 and  p=0.023, respectively) and slow cooling (p=0.033 and p=0.016, respectively). Although this phenomenon was not significant when analyzing subjects with SCI alone, significant changes were observed in the signal attributed to the metabolic control mechanism and were observed in this population with pressure only (p=0.019) and pressure with slow cooling (p=0.041). Since the reactive hyperemic response is mediated by different control mechanisms, the less obvious changes in reactive hyperemia in people with SCI may be due to alterations in microcirculation after injury. Results from this study suggest that local skin cooling is beneficial to ischemic tissue by decreasing the metabolic demand, and this is generally consistent with previous animal studies and our pilot study. Findings from this study also suggest that investigating time domain parameters and time-dependent spectral analysis of the SBF signal is helpful in understanding circulatory control in people with different levels of neurological deficits. This study contributes toward justification for the development of support surfaces with microclimate controls to enhance tissue integrity.

T1  - Thermal stress during pre-incubation induces subsequent developmental plasticity in northern bobwhites
AN  - 822234098
AB  - Northern bobwhite populations have declined concurrent with global warming. The focal period of this study was the 12-d pre-incubation period, when bobwhite eggs remain in the nest without the thermal protection of the incubating parent. This study first established the storage and thermal limits of bobwhite eggs, then investigated how global warming may impact oviparous embryos and how bobwhite embryos react to acute and chronic doses of simulated drought temperatures during pre-incubation.   First, the maximum storage limit of bobwhite eggs was determined by storing eggs ≤21 d and measuring hatching success and pH of egg albumen and yolk. Hatching success of stored eggs declined after 14 d, when yolk and albumen pH reached levels detrimental to embryonic development.   Secondly, thermal limits were determined by exposing bobwhite eggs to hyperthermic temperatures (38.52°C). Bobwhite embryos survived 50°C for 1 h, 49°C for 3 h and 46°C for 6 h. Results indicate an adaptation to the naturally occurring temperature extremes that can occur in the bobwhite's southern range during pre-incubation.   Subsequently, bobwhite eggs were exposed to either low constant (LC), low fluctuating (LF), high constant (HC), or high fluctuating (HF) temperatures during pre-incubation to determine if the nature of temperatures differentially affected development. Although eggs exposed to high heat loads (HC and HF), and low heat loads (LF and LC) had equal heating degree-hours within groups, they exhibited differential growth during pre-incubation. Oxygen consumption, hatch timing, and hatching success were also affected by the thermal regimes. Eggs in simulated drought (HF) had a 47% lower hatch rate than eggs in simulated non-drought (LF) indicating that thermal stress during pre-incubation may contribute to population declines during drought.   Finally, northern bobwhite eggs were exposed to acute or chronic doses of simulated drought temperatures, which tested for critical periods of development during pre-incubation. Collectively, data indicated that the earliest stages of bobwhite development were more affected by hyperthermic temperatures. Indeed, a critical period of development exists during the first 2/3 of pre-incubation during which exposure to hyperthermic temperatures results in aberrant development, hatching plasticity, and reduced hatch rates.

T1  - Physiological response to environmental variation in <i> Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</i> early developmental stages
AN  - 816481308
AB  - Given global climate change-driven environmental variation, a need for greater understanding of embryonic and larval responses to environmental stressors has become critical, especially when considering these stages may be especially sensitive to environmental perturbations. As such, this research sought to investigate the physiological effects of the climate change factors of temperature and ocean acidification on embryos and larvae of a marine invertebrate, the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus.   Using both mortality and hsp70 stress-induced gene expression as indices of thermal tolerance, elevated temperatures did not cause a detectable response gastrulae or 4-arm plutei stages. Additionally, embryos and larvae from different populations along the North American west coast did not differ in response to temperature, although the data suggest southern individuals were closer to their thermal limits than northern individuals due to the narrower temperature window between ambient and maximum hsp70 expression temperatures.   Morphological and gene expression measurements also were made to determine if embryos could carry out critical developmental processes under CO 2-induced ocean acidification conditions. Gastrulating embryos reared at 1000 ppm CO2 exhibited a modest developmental delay compared to those raised at the control CO2 concentration of 380 ppm. Elevated CO2 concentrations of 1000 ppm did not negatively impact the timing of spicule deposition in embryos. Using qPCR analysis to quantify biomineralization-specific gene expression in developing embryos at 540 ppm and 1000 ppm CO2, embryos exhibited detectable but non-significant shifts in SM30b and carbonic anhydrase (CA-7 likeA) expression at gastrula stage at both 540 ppm and 1000 ppm. Quantification of 7 genes specific to the gene regulatory network containing critical regulatory pathways necessary for gastrulation and the initiation of spiculogenesis revealed that expression of regulatory and skeletogenic lineage transcripts were relatively unaffected, with minor shifts in expression in only two genes at 1000 ppm and 1350 ppm during gastrulation. Conversely, significant changes in expression of a spicule matrix protein was found at 1350 ppm, suggesting that either protein translation or stability is more sensitive than transcription to elevated CO2.    Collectively, the data suggest that S. purpuratus early developmental stages are somewhat resilient to projected environmental change.

T1  - Physiological ecology and behaviour of bonefish (<i>Albula vulpes</i>) in tropical tidal flats ecosystems
AN  - 815790665
AB  - Knowledge of the physiological ecology and behaviour of fishes is particularly lacking for subtropical and tropical tidal flats when compared to temperate systems. The goal of this thesis was to use bonefish (Albula vulpes ) as a model to determine and describe the environmental relations offish in tropical tidal flats, and examine how energy is transported through these ecosystems. Prior to beginning experimentation, I developed strategies to facilitate the acclimation of wild bonefish to captivity, a prerequisite for laboratory studies that followed. A combined field and laboratory study examining the thermal biology of bonefish revealed that bonefish occupied habitats approaching their laboratory-determined thermal tolerance and can apparently do so without significant physiological consequences or mortality, except when exposed to additional stressors (e.g., catch and release angling). The strategy of how bonefish allocate their food energy was revealed through an examination of proximate body composition. Bonefish were composed of 72% water, 21% protein, 4% ash, and 3% lipid, which is consistent with the wet weight values of the majority of fishes studied to date. The lack of seasonal differences in whole body and liver lipid content suggested a sufficient food supply year round. Energetics and behaviour were also investigated using acoustic telemetry in the wild, with both traditional (position only) and acceleration transmitters, accompanied with ethograms in a mesocosm environment and laboratory respirometry experiments. Bonefish exhibited periods of site fidelity interspersed with transient behaviour, ultimately demonstrating connectivity between tidal creeks and nearshore coastal areas. Acceleration data revealed that bonefish typically operate between 40-60% of their estimated metabolic scope, and use swim-then-drift behaviours to maximize their energy efficiency. Collectively, this body of work revealed that bonefish use strategies that make them capable of handling the stochastic environment of subtropical and tropical tidal flats. Such information should be useful for management of the bonefish fishery, bioenergetics modeling, determining boundaries for marine protected areas, and assessing resiliency in tidal flats systems to future disturbances (e.g., climate change, habitat alteration, pollution, etc.).

T1  - The heat shock response and thermal biology of selected hydrothermal vent organisms
AN  - 757873043
AB  - The heat shock response in selected hydrothermal vent animals was studied. Heat shock protein induction profiles were compiled for three Lau Basin symbiotic mollusks, Induction profiles were used as indices for thermal tolerance and provided physiological data in support of observed species zonation at this site. A new type of thermal gradient block (The High Pressure Thermal Gradient Block) was developed to allow for in vitro investigations of heat shock protein induction in animal tissue at environmentally relevant pressures. The in vitro studies demonstrated protein synthesis is severely compromised in gill tissues from deep dwelling vent mollusks when exposed to 1 atmosphere. The results emphasized the need for performing physiological investigations in deep living organisms at in situ hydrostatic pressures. Heat shock protein induction profiles were obtained by exposing mollusk tissue to a range on incubation temperatures at environmentally relevant pressures in the High Pressure Thermal Gradient Block. The heat shock profiles show all three mollusks to be choosing habitats with temperatures well below their initial HSP 70 threshold induction temperature. The effect of long term environmental temperature on the heat shock response in deep-sea hydrothermal vent and cold seep mussels was also investigated. It was determined that although long term environmental temperatures impact the magnitude and temperature range in which the heat shock response in observed, the heat shock response remains intact in both cold seep and hydrothermal vent mussels examined here. Lastly the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the heat shock response in Bathymodioline mussels was investigated. It was determined that the heat shock response in mussels from depths between 600-900m is not inhibited by changes in hydrostatic pressure. However, inducible heat shock responses in hydrothermal vent mussels adapted to great depths (2500m) only observed in vitro at in situ pressures.

T1  - Primitive membranes and their role in the origins of life
AN  - 753901424
AB  - Single chain amphiphile membranes have long been proposed as precursors to modern cell membranes on the early Earth. Their availability from interstellar sources and syntheses mimicking prebiotic conditions support this claim. Previous research has shown their versatility as container molecules as they can self-assemble, encapsulate solutes, protect internal contents, harbor enzymatic reactions, grow, and divide. However, their structures can be less stable than modern ones as they are more sensitive to ions, pH, temperature, and dilution effects. Furthermore, the properties of single chain amphiphile vesicles are highly dependent on the exact identity of the amphiphiles, considering differing hydrocarbon chains and types of amphiphilic headgroups.    Historically, decanoic acid, along with other fatty acids, was considered an ideal candidate for modeling prebiotic membranes. Its simple chemical structure and behavior (rapid and spontaneous formation of membranes under appropriate conditions) support this hypothesis. These conditions however are limited by pH range and salt tolerance, as well as concentration of the amphiphile. To overcome these limitations the addition of a second amphiphile, glycerol monoacyl amphiphile was added to the fatty acids to determine the stability induced by mixed membranes. All measures of stability were improved upon the addition of this amphiphile, including temperature related stability, demonstrating the advantages of mixed amphiphile bilayers over pure systems.    Stable membranous structures do not, by themselves, present a strong case for the origin of life from a complex chemical matrix, however their interaction with metabolic (metal-ligand complex) and informational (nucleobase) complexes provides backing for such claims. Using a precursor that can be converted into decanoic acid, and therefore vesicular structures, it was demonstrated that the interaction of the metal-ligand/nucleobase components with both themselves and the protocell structures was tremendously important for the conversion of precursor into decanoic acid.    This conversion was hypothesized to lead to a growth of the structures and possibly division. Growth involved the uptake of nutrients (precursor) by the system and their conversion into more membrane forming material, which was proven qualitatively to function in this protocellular model. Division was then performed by extrusion, which led to the reduction and homogenization of the total population size, thereby completing the "life-cycle". This process is yet incomplete until the replication of the "information" becomes a reality.    For information replication to be realized, it will be necessary to incorporate a polymer of nucleic acid into the system. One of the major questions in the origin of life is the ability to form polymers by self-condensation (non template-directed) of available chemical monomers. Interestingly, it was shown that single chain amphiphile vesicles are capable of assisting this process when non-activated ribonucleotides (specifically adenosine), are exposed to cycles of dehydration rehydration at high temperatures. This process may be one of the first steps to creating information polymers from a pool of chemicals non-enzymatically.    This thesis combines fragments of what is currently believed to be key steps in the origin of life to piece together a complete view of the transition from chemical to biological systems, with emphasis on the membrane structures that are assumed to have been critical to the development of a complex biological network.

T1  - Neuroendocrine response to acute and repeated exertional heat stress in endurance trained and untrained males
AN  - 748248410
AB  - Increases in rectal temperature (Tre) augment stress hormones, however the effect of different Tre tolerated with varying fitness levels during exertional heat stress (EHS) is unclear. Heat acclimation is known to increase tolerance time and Tre tolerated, and reduce physiological strain, yet it is unknown if repeated EHS reduces the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic-adrenomedullary system (SAS) response, and indicators of central fatigue (CF) at any given level of thermal strain.  PURPOSE: To examine the HPA axis, SAS, and indicators of CF during acute EHS in trained (TR) versus untrained (UT) (study 1) and during repeated EHS in UT males (study 2). METHODS: Subjects walked to exhaustion (EXH) on a treadmill (4.5 km·h-1, 2% incline) in 40°C (dry), wearing combat clothing and a protective hooded overgarment, for acute and repeated (9 days over 11 days) sessions. Study 1 included 12 TR and 11 UT (V˙O2peak = 70±2 and 50±1 mĿkgLBM1˙min -1) and study 2 included 9 UT (V˙O2peak = 51.7±1.9 mĿkgLBM-1˙min-1) males. Venous blood samples were obtained at rest (PRE; prior to heat) and at a Tre of38, 38.5, 39, 39.5, 40.0°C and/or EXH. Hormone analyses were completed by chemiluminescence, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS:  Study 1: Cortisol (COR) responded to absolute thermal strain, increasing throughout EHS and independent of fitness. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), norepinephrine (NE), and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S) responded to relative thermal strain. Epinephrine (E), growth hormone (GH), and aldosterone (ALDO) increased initially, with a plateau above 38.5°C Tre (Manuscript I). Free tryptophan (f-TRP) exhibited a significant fall at 39.5°C for TR (II). Study 2: NE, ACTH, DHEA-S, and ALDO responded to relative thermal strain, COR and E to absolute thermal strain, and GH exhibited a plateau effect beyond 38.0°C on Day 9 (III). f-TRP was attenuated and branch chain amino acids (BCAA) elevated on Day 9 (IV). Prolactin (PRL) increased linearly with Tre.  CONCLUSION: The stress pathways responded largely to relative thermal strain, although some hormones exhibited a clamping response likely as a protective mechanism. For the TR, evidence existed for a reduced pituitary sensitivity to glucocorticoids and the amplified GH may have contributed to their greater Tre tolerated. The significant fall in f-TRP at 39.5°C for acute TR and attenuated f-TRP and elevated BCAAs on Day 9 is consistent with loss of blood-brain barrier integrity and reduced CF, respectively. PRL is a critically important marker of fatigue given its strong relationship with Tre.

T1  - Microneedle devices for intracellular neuronal recording and high throughput cellular interrogation
AN  - 622202679; 2010-99060-279
AB  - This dissertation focuses on sub-μm tip microneedle devices for neuronal recording. The first part of this work presents the design and development of an implantable high aspect ratio 350-400 μm tall silicon probe device with flexible interconnects. The probe's ability to penetrate and record from neurons in an isolated brain of the sea slug 
Tritonia diomedea was tested and it was demonstrated for the first time that an implantable device can record intracellular action potentials. The design features the separation of electronics from the region of cell penetration and hence minimal mechanical load on the cell. The fabrication of the intracellular implant allows for post processing capability after the sharpening of the needle electrode. The success of this prototype is a major step toward self-contained, implantable devices suited for intracellular neuronal recording from freely behaving animals. Enhancements to the working device, in particular needle shaft insulation, tip metallization and reduction of cell wall shear during penetration have been addressed and incorporated into the microfabrication process. Novel biomaterial coatings were evaluated for their suitability as coatings for neural probes. An inherent limitation of this design is that it is not adaptable for multi unit cellular interrogation. The last part of this work presents the technology for low substrate temperature (∼400°C) growth of high-density, defect-free, unidirectional arrays of Si needles using selective vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. The low substrate temperature allows possible integration of on-chip CMOS circuitry or biomaterials with minimal thermal damage. The needle growth was performed in a hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) chamber that featured the unique combination of a high filament temperature and a low substrate temperature. The needle growth was independent of substrate orientation, enabling possible integration with flexible substrates. The needle arrays (6-8 μm tall, sub-μm tips) are envisioned as high density electrodes of an integrated retinal implant. This work may lead to a “needles on pillars” technology for multi unit intracellular recording from cortical tissue and/or a platform for light stimulation and drug delivery to a network of neurons.

T1  - Mechanisms of heat acclimation and exercise performance
AN  - 288428483
AB  - There has been a lot of research investigating the effects of heat stress and exercise on the physiological adaptations to heat acclimation. It is well documented that heat acclimation improves heat tolerance and performance in a hot environment; however, some of the mechanisms of adaptation are not clear. Furthermore, the role of heat acclimation on exercise performance in cool environments is currently unknown. Therefore, in Chapter IV we aimed to determine the effects of heat acclimation on lactate threshold and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in cool and hot conditions. We also sought to investigate the effects of heat acclimation on leg blood flow and oxygen delivery during a single-leg knee extensor exercise. We found that heat acclimation improved lactate threshold and VO2max in cool and hot environments but did not alter the leg blood flow and oxygen delivery during the leg kicking exercise. In Chapter V we investigated the heat acclimation effects on performance during a 1-hour time trial in hot and cool environmental conditions and the potential mechanisms by which this occurs. A secondary objective was to study whether the pacing strategy was modified during the time trial post-heat acclimation. The results demonstrated that heat acclimation improved time trial performance in both thermal environments by approximately 7% but pacing strategy was not altered. The purpose of the studies in Chapter VI were twofold. First, we sought to investigate how heat acclimation affects the skin blood flow and sweating responses to pharmacological treatment with specific dosages of the muscarinic receptor agonist acetylcholine. Second, we examined the maximal skin blood flow responses to a period of heat acclimation by locally heating the forearm with a water spray device for 45 minutes and measured brachial artery blood flow via ultrasound. We found that heat acclimation increased sweat rate and skin blood flow responses to given concentrations of acetylcholine, suggesting a role for peripheral mechanisms. On the other hand, maximal skin blood flow remained unchanged after heat acclimation.

T1  - Development of a laboratory based system for selecting insect pathogenic fungi with greatest potential for success in the field
AN  - 250962934
AB  - Many insects are important agricultural pests, and active control is necessary to keep them at abeyance. The naturally occurring entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium is a promising tool to control pest insects, and its use avoids the well-known harmful side effects of chemical pesticides. Thousands of unique isolates of Metarhizium exist throughout the world. These isolates vary widely in their ability to cause infection and to tolerate stressful habitats. The research reported here tests the THESIS: A laboratory-based system can be devised that identifies, from among many Metarhizium isolates, those isolates with the greatest potential for successful biological control of pest insects in the field. The study was built on the testing of four hypotheses: (1) Laboratory bioassays using target pest insects will distinguish highly virulent strains of Metarhizium from less virulent strains, (2) Quantity and quality of mass-produced pathogenic fungi will vary among species and strains of Metarhizium, (3) The tolerance to ultraviolet radiation will vary among species and strains of Metarhizium, (4) The effect of temperature on growth rates and survival of both Metarhizium  spores and hyphae will vary among isolates and species. These hypotheses test four field-relevant traits using a panel of ten isolates of  Metarhizium isolates.   Seven sets of laboratory experiments were devised to define the range of responses within the traits covered by the hypotheses. This series of general laboratory tests was developed to assist in identifying fungal isolates with high potential for field use. These tests included evaluation of each isolate’s (a) insect pathogenicity, (b) mass-production capabilities, (c) tolerance to high temperatures, (d) tolerance to UV-B radiation, (e) rate of vegetative growth, (f) rate of spore germination, and (g) an evaluation of presence or absence of a post-stress growth inhibition. The application of this protocol to the isolates used in this study indicates that four isolates have high field potential, i.e., DWR 203, DWR 346, DWR 356 and ARSEF 324, and three of these were tested in a field trial. By following the procedures outlined in this thesis, selection of “good” isolates can be accomplished in the laboratory, and a successful isolate can be identified from the abundance of isolates present in nature.

T1  - Functional consequences of acute temperature stress in the western fence lizard, <i>Sceloporus occidentalis</i>
AN  - 250907414
AB  - Understanding the effects of natural variation in environmental temperature on organisms and how those organisms evolve to live in different thermal environments is a central tenet of evolutionary physiology. Phenotypic differences among populations are the result of local adaptation, innate genetic differences between populations, and phenotypic plasticity, differential responses to the environment. Although not mutually exclusive, distinguishing between these paradigms can help illuminate species boundaries resulting from thermal limitations in physiology. For my dissertation, I examined geographic variation in measures of thermal physiology of the western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis  to understand the relative role of adaptation and acclimation in determining the thermal biology of populations of this species living in different thermal environments.   To achieve this goal I measured three indices of physiological function; body temperature, thermal tolerance and heat shock protein (Hsp70) abundance, across geographic and seasonal variation in temperature. Furthermore, I examined variation in sprint speed performance before and after heat stress and its relationship to Hsp70 to determine if stress protein expression is a reliable indicator of whole organism physiological stress.   I found that geographic location can have a major effect on thermal physiology and performance in S. occidentalis in that thermal tolerance, Hsp70, and sprint speed varied with site and season with warmer southern sites typically more heat adapted than cooler northern sites. I also found a trade off in thermal tolerance suggesting that specialization to temperature was occurring in these lizards. Finally, lizards with increased Hsp70 were typically slower after heat stress indicating that Hsp70 is a reliable indicator of organism stress. Despite these findings, there was no difference in body temperature among sites and seasonal patterns in thermal tolerance suggest that during certain times of the year plastic responses to temperature may mask adaptive differences.   Here, I argue that temperature differences between sites has resulted in temperature adaptation at these sites, but that plastic responses to seasonal variation in temperature can become more important during certain times of the year. Although these relationships have been thoroughly studied in invertebrate organisms, further research should examine whether these patterns exist in other vertebrate ectotherm species.

T1  - Physiological Responses to Rising Temperatures in the Intertidal: A Case Study of a Goby and a Mussel
AN  - 2443656790
AB  - The intertidal is a harsh environment, existing at the interface of terrestrial and marine habitats. The rise and fall of the tides forces inhabitants to survive a constant flux of environmental stressors including desiccation, temperature extremes, intense solar radiation, and predation from terrestrial and marine predators. Ectotherms, whose body temperatures fluctuate with the temperature of their surroundings, have adapted to survival in this relentless environment. This dissertation evaluates two intertidal species that have mastered the art of intertidal living in a fluctuating thermal environment.In the goby fish, Gillichthys mirabilis, I evaluate global changes in gene expression of gill tissues following acclimation to a wide range of temperature (9°C to 28°C). I compare and contrast strategies for maintaining homeostasis in warm versus cold-acclimated fish, with a particular emphasis on assessing the costs of living at warmer temperatures. None of the acclimated fish expressed genes characteristic of a stress response, reflecting an acclimation process that has largely remedied the effects of acute thermal stress and established a new steady-state condition. However, increased expression of genes involved in protein biosynthesis and membrane-localized transport rise with acclimation temperature, implicating an overall increase in the costs of living at higher temperatures. Higher energetic costs sustained during warm acclimation imply that, despite this species' extreme eurythermy, a trade-off may exist whereby less energy is available for other processes (notably growth and reproduction).Next, I examine how acclimation affects the mechanisms by which these fish respond to acute thermal stress, as might be experienced on a 'hot day' at low tide. I also sought to identify gene expression changes that would define relative severity of sublethal thermal stress (e.g., mild versus extreme, near lethal stress). I found that for each ~10°C increase in acclimation temperature, the global threshold induction temperature for 'stress response' genes shifted upwards by ~2°C. In some cases, warm acclimation appeared to obviate the need for a specific stress gene's induction until the most extreme temperatures were reached. I identified several markers whose up-regulation in gill tissue may be useful in the context of identifying severity of thermal stress in the field (mild stress: HSP70, moderate stress: HSP60, HSP40, and HSPA9, extreme stress: CDKN1B and LONRF1). Elucidation of the effects of acclimation on induction thresholds for the different components of the cellular stress response provides important insights into the fundamental mechanisms of adaptation to highly variable thermal environments.In the California ribbed mussel, Mytilus californianus, I examined populations along a latitudinal range to assess whether all mussels had the same capacity to respond to thermal stress. This species is a dominant intertidal species that ranges from Alaska to Baja California along the west coast of North America, resulting in populations living at widely different temperatures. Interestingly, multiple studies have concluded that this species is genetically homogenous. I found that individuals acclimated to common conditions had significant differences in whole organism thermal tolerance. I investigated several physiological processes that might explain this pattern, including critical thermal maximum (Hcrit) of cardiac function, metabolic capacity (as indexed by tissue activities of two indicator enzymes involved in energy metabolism) and kinetic properties and thermal stability of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. Although significant interpopulation variation was found in these physiological characteristics, these processes did not fully explain the pattern we found in whole organism thermal tolerance. Nevertheless, we provide evidence that genetic structure or selective post-settlement mortality may occur in this species.

T1  - Physiological constraints on the ecology of activity-limited ectotherms
AN  - 193716913
AB  - Organismal exchanges of heat, water, and metabolizable energy with their environment are important influences on their behavior, physiology and, life history. Where extreme climates and resource-poor environments restrict an organism's overall activity budget, physiology—through performance, tolerance, acclimation, and tradeoffs—becomes a primary influence on that organism's ecology. Vertebrate ectotherms exemplify these physiological constraints because their body temperatures are closely tied to thermal and hydric exchanges with their environment; they are typically highly tolerant of a broad range of conditions; and they exhibit boom-and-bust cycles related to release from constraints. This dissertation examines physiological constraints on wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) at the extreme southwestern edge of their range, desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) which spend >98% of their lives in burrows, and the eggs of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) which incubate for months on a tropical beach during the dry season. The distribution of microhabitats available to each focal ectotherm delineated where and when these organisms could be surface-active, what constituted adequate refugia for intolerable surface periods, and why these activity-limited organisms behave differently from conspecifics elsewhere. Direct measurements of physiological performance (metabolic rates, locomotion) over the focal organism's tolerated range of body temperatures and hydrations assessed the consequences of thermal and hydric exchanges with suboptimal microhabitats. These exercises constitute a quantification of important influences on the physiological ecology of activity-limited vertebrate ectotherms. Comparative analysis of the allometry of physiological traits in a variety of mammals served to elucidate the functional and phylogenetic constraints on physiological adaptation. This quantitative and model-based approach is useful for quantifying risk (e.g., desiccation risk), estimating processes that are hard to measure (e.g., metabolic heating of sea turtle eggs buried 1 m deep in sand), and predicting responses to future changes (e.g., global warming). These qualities recommend this approach as a practical tool in conservation biology.

T1  - Types of regional eco-industrial network and analysis and evaluation of its stability-taking ning dong energy (coal) chemical base as the case
AN  - 1870372164
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAt present, the research of regional industrial ecosystem is more concentrated in the Eco-industrial Park (EIP). The results may be limited to the perspective of industrial parks within the region and how to build a park's ecological industry chain among all factories. Therefore, this paper proposes to extend the study to the regional level and establish regional Eco-industrial Network (EIN) combined with the current regional situation. Eco-industrial Network is a special type of industrial ecosystem. It is an important practical form of Circular Economy at the regional level, and a concept that has a much higher level and broader range than Eco-industrial Park. In the narrow sense, the EIN is a regional union in which kinds of factories or enterprises are connected to one whole and divided into producers, consumers and decomposers, which is similar to the natural ecosystems, by flow of materials and energy. Among the units, they share resources and trade by-products to make one factory's wastes or by-products another factory's raw materials or energy. The Purpose of EIN is to achieve the multi-stage recycling of materials and energy, and waste minimization. In general, the EIN is a certain collection of all factories and enterprises within the region. It does not emphasize these factories must be interconnected. In EIN, there may have eco- industrial chain, may also be composed of independent businesses. EIN is included EIPs, the traditional industrial parks and independent businesses. On this basis, this paper focuses on the structure types and stability of EIN, then analyzes on the stability of EIN qualitatively and quantitatively. Two indexes of the correlation and cycle paths ratio are selected to divide the types of EIN structure. The EIN is divided into scattered points, linear, cluster, ring and mixed as 5 types. Then the impacts of various types of structural characteristics to enterprise diversity, resource use efficiency and stability are discussed. For the factors affecting stability of EIN, this paper analyzes 18 indexes belong to six categories of political, economic, spatial layout, links, forms, supply and technology, and qualitatively analyzes the stability of EIN by using this indexes. Then select three structural complexity indexes such as the factory diversity, correlation and cycle paths ratio, and three resource use efficiency indexes such as the average path length, loop index and waste recycling rate for the eco-industrial network stability quantitative evaluation. Finally, this paper is in order to Ning Dong Energy (Coal) Chemical Base as an example for the empirical study. Ning Dong Energy Base is composed of coal, power, and coal chemical as three leading industries. Now the base is basically able to form two leading industrial chains which are based on coal and extended to the thermal power and coal chemical industry. In addition, there are several added chain industries such as building materials, machinery and so on. Then the Development of Ning Dong Energy Base is analyzed qualitatively with the stability factors of EIN described above which are combined with the actual situation of the base. Next, stability quantitative evaluation of the EIN of the base is done. The results show that factory diversity of the base is high; three leading industries have close links, but added chain industries link loosely; the waste recycling rates of some factory population is high, but that of the whole base is low. According to the results, some development proposals of the base are

T1  - Studies on characteristics of stress tolerance of early hybrid rice seeds
AN  - 1869123805
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorWith the development of early super hybrid rice,the quality of seed has been attracting more and more attention of research and application institutions. New seeds' germination started, germination rate and vigor of germination are more quickly than conventional rice. Stages in seed germination, it has stronger metabolism advantage and higher viability, but the seed dormancy, storage and stress tolerance is not very good. The stress tolerance of seeds is easy to deteriorate in the process of development and storage. It has caused tremendous economic losses on agricultural production. Revealing the seed's stress tolerance, and improving the seed's vitality and resistant storage, has great significance on promotion and application of super hybrid rice. The research takes the super hybrid rice zhuliangyou02 seed as material and conventional rice seed as contrast, and it researches how to improve seed vitality and quality in production in order to offer academic guidance. Ⅰ.A comparison of the stress tolerance of different maturity seed's on the super hybrid rice zhuliangyou02. With the development of super hybrid rice zhuliangyou02 seed, the water content of seed is reducing and the germination rate is growing. The seed is Pollinated 9d has germination capacity, pollinated 17-21d's has highest germination rate, but the germination rate of overripe seed is declined. Low Temperature Storage capacity of seed is related to maturity, water content, storage temperature and time. The higher maturity and water content within safety limits of the seed have stronger low Temperature storage capacity. In the storage conditions between 5℃ and -5℃, the germination rate of the seed with more water content is decreasing; particularly the seed with low-maturity is the most sensitive. The super hybrid rice zhuliangyou02 seed has the artificial aging of no-high temperature and humidity, and with the aging time, the germination rate of the super hybrid rice zhuliangyou02 seed is decreasing. Between the seed have different maturity; it grown by 15-17d has the strongest ability in high temperature and humidity. Ⅱ.A comparison of stress tolerance between hybrid rice seeds and conventional rice seeds. The germination rate of rice seed with different water contents in different storage temperatures has significant impact. The hybrid rice seed with more water contents have more sensitive than conventional rice seed. The rice seed has 30% water content is stored in -20℃, has the particularly low temperature harm, and all seeds haven't germination capacity was stored 30d. And the super hybrid rice zhuliangyou02 seed is more obvious than others. The 5℃temperature is the helpful temperature for stored lower water content of rice seed. The rice seed have the highest germination rate stored by drying silica gel. Research results Show: reducing the rice seed's water content and improving the storage capacity of seed are the most effective measures. With the immersion in cold water, the germination rate of the rice seed has decreased, and the margin of the super hybrid rice zhuliangyou02 seed is more than conventional rice seed'. With the immersion in cold water between 5℃ and 10℃ and 15℃, the greatest harm is the immersion in 15℃ water, and the second harm is the immersion in 5℃ water. And the seed has a bad breath in higher temperature, and has the harm in lower temperature. Being rehydrated treatment in 8h and 16h and 24h, the seed has the largest harm in 24h, the second harm in 16h, and the third harm in 8h. Rehydration capacity of resistance of the super hybrid rice zhuliangyou02 seed is worse than conventional rice seed'. The seed of Indicia PSB RC82 is from the Philippines and Japonica is from Japan both have stronger rehydration capacity of resistances. The germination capacity of the rice seed decreases when temperature decreases, and the seed have different germination capacities in different variety. Under the 25℃ and 20℃, the speed of the seed germinating is slowly, and the germination vigor has an obviously decreasing. Have an affected in 15℃, the germination rate has an obviously decreasing, and the seed haven't germinating in 10℃. And Indicia germination capacity in low temperature is higher than Japonica. There are significant differences in the harvest sprouting feature of different rice variety. Easy to harvest sprouting of seed has no dormancy and weekly ability in high temperature and humidity, and than difficult to harvest sprouting of

T1  - Relationship between physical and chemical factors in shrimp pond and growth of penaeus monodon and occurrence of white spot syndrome
AN  - 1868700130
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorIn the process of extensive development,shrimp farming industry has exposed a lot of important issues such as aquaculture water pollution, aquaculture disease outbreaks and so on. Thus quality management of aquaculture water and disease control have been thought as the keys to breeding success. The relationship between physicochemical factors in shrimp pond and growth of Penaeus monodon and occurrence of white spot syndrome have been researched and analysised in the thesis.That not only provides aquaculture production and management with practical guidance,but also helps to better understand the impact of water physical and chemical factors on shrimp growth and occurrence of disease in the process of breeding,and also has a certain value in theory.The main results of this research are as follows: 1. In the situation of the breeding density of 5000-11600 shrimps / acre and not changing the water, by breeding management and artificial control, physical and chemical factors in the detection can be maintained in the tolerance scope of Penaeus monodon.Correlation analyses show that physical and chemical factors are significantly correlated with each other. However, the relationships between the physical and chemical factors are complex and there are no simple linear relationships. Principal component analysis reveales that three factors extracted can sufficiently cover most of the information, including F1 and F2 accounted for the greatest proportion.F1 is mainly composed of the transparency, nitrite, COD, pH.F2 is mainly composed of TP, ammonia nitrogen, TN, and dissolved oxygen.F3 is mainly composed of nitrates, water temperature and salinity. Differences of shrimp pond water quality are primarily decided by transparency, nitrite, COD and pH. 2.This thesis has also analysised relationship between body length and weight of Penaeus monodon by software spss. The results of the linear regression curve fitting analyses show that relationship between Penaeus monodon's body length (L) and weight (W) is W = aLb , and R2 is generally greater than 0.900,so we think that the curve is well fitted. The relationship between the average body length and weight of the Penaeus monodon has also been analysised by spss and the curve fittings of the average body length and weight work very well and relationship between average body length and weight of Penaeus monodon can be simplified to the formula of W = 0.014L3.000. This thesis also uses software spss to analysis correlation between physical and chemical factors and body length and weight of Penaeus monodon .The analyses show that in the the different shrimp pond, the situation is different.In general, body length and weight have no significant correlation with ammonia nitrogen, some negatively significant correlation with nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen,but have positively and negatively significant correlation with COD both, and have significant correlation with TN and TP, some negatively significant correlation with transparency and salinity, negatively significant correlation with dissolved oxygen,and no significant correlation with pH and water temperature. 3.In this thesis, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) of Penaeus monodon in the No.8-1,8-2,8-3 and 10 shrimp ponds has been detected by quantitative PCR.Results of the detection show that copy number of white spot syndrome virus of Penaeus monodon in No. 8-1 ,8-2 ,8-3 and 10 shrimp pond has almost the same trend of change with time.At first and at the middle of the breeding time, copy number remains steady and waves from some rangs,but then have significant increase at last,especially in No.10 shrimp pond at this time has a sharp rise. According to the detection results and breeding records, this study suggests that threshold of viruses' copy number in an outbreak of white spot syndrome may be 2×105~2×106copies/g, and copy number of WSSV is likely to have a rapid growth in short time,and at last copy number of WSSV break the critical value and then white spot syndrome outbreaks. By software spss,correlations between physical and chemical factors and WSSV have been analysised.The results note that ammonium nitrogen and water temperature may be the critical impact factors of causing outbreak of white spot

The dominant bacteria were Aerornonas spp, Enterobacteriacea, Vibrio spp, Pseudomonas spp.12, 9 and 7 taxonomic groups were identificated from the foregut, midgut and hindgut respectively. Those bacterial strains include Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp, Misrococcus spp, Staphulococcus spp, Enterobacteriacea, Pseudomonas spp, Alcaligenes spp, Vibrio spp, Aerornonas spp, Moraxella spp, Acinetobacter spp, Flavobacterium spp. (2)121 baiteria strains isolated form intestinal tract of cultured Pelteobagrus fulvidraco were used for testing the zymogenicities of protease, lipase and amylase, the antagonistic against 5 kinds of common pathogenic bacterias and the antibiotic sensitivity. the toxicity of strain HS140 screened as potential probiotic for Pelteobagrus fulvidraco was evaluated, and HS140 was identified according to it' s morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics as well as homology analysis of 16S rRNA genes sequences. The results indicated that HS140 have high zymogenicities ability and inhibitory to Edwardsiella tarda, Aeromonas sobria and Vibrio anguillarum. HS140 was resistant to ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole, VI cefradine, but sensitive or medium sensitive to the other 13 kinds of antibiotics , such as fulgram, neomycin and so on. It was safe for Pelteobagrus fulvidraco when they were challenged by a high immersion concent ration of HS140 at 108cfu/mL. Morphology observation showed that HS140 was gram-positive, rod and motile. The results revealed that strain HS140 comprised sequences more related to B. licheniformis (99.3%) from partial 16S rRNA genes sequences. The identification showed that strain HS140 was B. licheniformis by the way of morphology, biochemistry characteristic and 16S rRNA genes sequence homology analysis. (3)A strain of B. licheniformis HS140 with high ectoenzyme-producing ability was screened from Pelteobagrus fulvidraco Intestine. The growth characters of HS140 and Tolerance of pH, bile salt and thermal were investigated. The results indicated that the optimum fermenting time of HS140 was 16 hours; HS140 had significant acid resistance, the survival counts of HS140 about 102 cfu/mL could be detected when pH value was at 2 for 2 hour; the number of HS140 reduced with the increase of bile salt concentration, less than 104 cfu/mL number of HS140 was detected when more than 0.30% bile salt was added in culture medium for 2 hours; In addition, HS140 had Obvious thermal resistance, the number of HS140 can reach 5.6×106 cfu/mL and 2.8×106 cfu/mL at 90 ℃and 100 ℃ for 10 minutes. The study showed that HS140 have great development prospect in the Pelteobagrus fulvidraco microbial preparations for it's tolerance characteristics. (4)Pelteobagrus fulvidraco was fed with diets supplemented with different amount of B. licheniformis HS140. 56 days after the inoculation, the infulence of dietary B. licheniformis on the resistance of yellow cartfish were determined by examing the variation of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial quantity and composition of the predominant bacterias. The results showed that the numbers of the interstinal microflora of yellow cartfish increase to about 1×108 cfu/g after feeding B. licheniformis with HS140, the differences was not much evident among the groups. After feeding with B. licheniformis HS140 the percentage of aeromonas and enterobacteriaceae diclined and Bacilus increased as the feeding days inceasing. (5)Pelteobagrus fulvidraco was fed with diets supplemented with appopriate amount of B. licheniformis HS140. 56 days after the inoculation, the infulence of dietary B. licheniformis on the resistance of Pelteobagrus fulvidraco were determined by examing their gained weigh, lysozyme activity, phagocytic activity, total protein, SGPT activity in serum and relative percent survival (RPS) by challenging with live A. hydrophi. The results showed the adding B. licheniformis into the diets can not only enhance the immune response and the resistance of Pelteobagrus fulvidraco to A.hydrophi, but also improve their liver function and promote their growth to some degree. The appropriate adding density of B. licheniformis was 5×108

T1  - Preliminary analysis on the microflora of the intestinal tract of ricefield eel,monopterus albus and development and application of its probiotic
AN  - 1868352290
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorOn the basis of the preliminary analysis on the microflora of the intestinal tract of healthy Ricefield eel and Ricefield eel suffering from bacteria septicemia , 118 bacteria strains isolated from heathy intestinal tract of cultured Ricefield Eel were used for testing the producing zymogenicities of protease, lipase and amylase, the antagonistic against common pathogenic bacterias and the antibiotic sensitivity, choose the strain HY-136 screened as potential probiotic, and it was identified as Bacillus subtilis. In the following time, we investigated the high temperature resistance, acid resistance, security, culture condition and perfect culture medium of strain HY-136. then we investigated the effect of HY-136 as the feed additive on the growth and nonspecific immunity indices of Ricefield eel. The results were as follows: 1. The features on the microflora of the intestinal tract of healthy Ricefield eel were dctected. The results showed that the bacteria number of the foregut and hindgut is 1.54×106cfu/g and 5.65×106cfu/g. The ratio of Enterobacteriacea and Aeromonas is 37.29% and 17.80%, they are the principal bacteria of the intestinal tract of healthy Ricefield eel. At the same time, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, staph., Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium were detected. And the features on the micro eco-sructures of the intestinal tract of Ricefield eel suffering from bacteria septicemia showed that the bacteria number of the foregut and hindgut is 9.83×105cfu/g and 8.78×105cfu/g. The ratio of Enterobacteriacea and Aeromonas is 22.50% and 38.33%, they are also the principal bacteria. The foregut and hindgut species of bacterial flora of the healthy fish is 9,5. which in the disease fish is 7,4. Above the results showed that Enterobacteriacea and Aeromonas are the principal bacteria of Ricefield eel, the total microflora in healthy fish were more than which in disease fish. Under the different status, the ratio and the species of bacterial flora in the intestinal tract may be to change. 2. The testing experiment of the producing protease, lipase, amylase and gelatine liquefication amylase showed that, the ratio of strains which were able to produce enzyme is 33.03%, 26.27%, 50.00%, 20.34%. Strain HY-136 and strain HY-157 were perspective. The results of antagonistic disease bacteria by dot inoculating showed that strain HY-1366 can inhibit Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria, Vibrio anguillarum, Edwardsiella tarda. strain HY-201 and strain HY-212 also showed some antagonistic action against partly antagonistic disease bacteria. Among them, the strain HY-201 has tolerance to 7 kinds antibiotics. Above all the test, we choose the strain HY-136 as the probiotics to develop it. According to its morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics, API 50 CHB system, and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA, strain HY-136 was identified as Bacillus subtilis. 3. The experiment of temperature resistance, acid resistance, showed that, strain HY-136 has the better tolerance to high temperature and different level of pH. Besides that, when the bacterium suspension concentration of strain HY-136 was 1.0×109cfu/mL, the immature Ricefield eel were not to dead or happened to ill. So we can see that strain HY-136 is safe. 4. The optimum condition of strain HY-136 to cultivate were as follows, time, initial pH, temperature and inoculum Sizes was 22h, 7.0, 32℃ and 4% ( v/v ) respectively. And the optimum nitrogen source, carbon source, mineral salt source was beef extract, glucose and Cacl2 respectively. With the orthogonal experiment of L9(34), the ratio of beef extract, glucose and Cacl2 in the optimum seed culture medium is 2.0 %, 2.0% and 0.5%. 5. The resaults showed that the average gain weight between supplement groups and control groups has the significant disparity, so we can say that strain HY-136 was able to prompt growth of Ricefield eel to some degree. Though the total protein in serum of each experiment groups was not changed, the fluctuation of Phagocytic activity, Lysozyme activity, SOD activity between supplement groups and control groups were significant, and those supplement groups were against Aeromonas hydrophila well when fishs challenging with live A. hydrophila. Simultaneously, we noticed that effects of the supplement group which contents 1.0×109cfu/g was the best among the supplement groups, but this conclusion should be experimental tested in the following

T1  - Comparative study on the difference of different geographic populations in tribolium castaneum
AN  - 1868211589
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), distributes in most of the tropical and temperate regions of the world and most provinces of China. Tribolium castaneum is an important storage pest and resource insect, as well as a significant model insect. In order to reduce the loss in agriculture production caused by Tribolium castaneum and further exploit and utilize it. Some morphological and biological indexes of Tribolium castaneum collected from 7 different geographical populations(including Shandong,Shanxi,Zhejiang,Hubei,Hunan,Fujian and Guangxi) had been compared.In addition, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique was used to analyze the the esterase isozyme diversity of 7 different geographical popolations. The main results are as follows: 1 Morphology Some morphological indexes of each instar(egg,larvae, pupa and adult) of 7 different geographical populations were compared.The results showed that there were significant differences among each other in each index except for the egg.According to the research of the body length and body weight of the final instar larva,we found that the population from Shanxi predominated over other 6 ones in these two factors,which the body length is 6.26mm and the body weight is 3.72mg.Both the body length and body weight of Guangxi poplation are the minimum,only 5.44mm and2.40mg.It shows the similar trend on pupal length,pupal weight,adult length and adult weight,which is that it becomes smaller as the latitude decreases. 2 Biology Parts of the biological characteristics of 7 different geographical populations were compared in this article. The results shows that all the indexes including generation effective cumulative temperature,development duration, heat tolerance,cold tolerance and hunger tolerance were significantly different among different geographical populations.We found that the generation effective cumulative temperature and development duration improved as the latitude increased.On the opposite side, heat tolerance and cold tolerance seem to be no connect with latitude.At the same time,there shows a marked relationship with the adult shape in the hunger tolerance study. 3 Esterase Isozyme Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique was used to analyze the esterase isoenzyme of 7 different geographical populations of Tribolium castaneum.The result shows that there are not genetic diversity and geographical differentiation among those geographical

T1  - The thermal macrophysiology of core and marginal populations of the aphid myzus persicae in europe
AN  - 1314578643
AB  - Insects are ectotherms and have limited ability to regulate body temperature above or below ambient and are consequently greatly affected by temperature. The aphid \(Myzus\) \(persicae\) has an extensive distribution throughout Europe from Scandinavia to Southern Spain, representing three distinct climatic regions: sub-Arctic, temperate and Mediterranean. The aphid also has genetically distinct clones within its holocyclic (sexual) and anholocyclic (asexual) life cycles. This raises the possibility that aphids are regionally-adapted to distinct climatic zones along the latitudinal cline of its European distribution. Genetically distinct clones of \(M. persicae\) were collected from Sweden, UK and Spain. Indices of temperature tolerance (upper and lower lethal temperature50, coma temperatures and mobility thresholds) were determined for each aphid clone at different rearing temperatures. Acclimation at 10°C for one generation increased cold tolerance by depressing lower lethal, chill movement and chill coma temperatures when compared to 20°C and 25°C and further enabled mobility to be maintained to lower temperatures. Acclimation at 25°C for one generation increased heat tolerance by raising upper lethal, heat movement and heat coma temperatures when compared to 10°C and 20°C. Acclimation at 10°C also acted to raise upper lethal temperatures, indicating that the physiological processes conferring heat tolerance are induced at both high and low temperatures. Data did not support intergenerational acclimation to higher or lower temperatures. Lower thermal limits were more plastic than upper limits, enabling tolerance ranges to be increased following acclimation at 10°C, but reduced on acclimation at 25°C. Rates of change varied between clones, suggesting that certain clones could be more affected by climate change. A relationship between thermal tolerance range and latitude was not supported by data on thermal traits investigated with the exception of heat coma temperature. This suggests that clonal mixing across Europe is extensive and prevents local adaptation, although long term populations could persist in the Mediterranean allowing increased heat tolerance. Clonal type, as identified by microsatellite analysis, did show a relationship with thermal tolerance, suggesting that clonal types could respond independently to climate change, affecting relative proportions of clones within populations.

T1  - Thermal biology and establishment potential of two non-native candidate biological control agents, nesidiocoris tenuis reuter (hemiptera: miridae) and lysiphlebus testaceipes (cresson) (hymenoptera: braconidae, aphidiinae), in the u.k
AN  - 1040635626
AB  - \(Nesidiocoris\) \(tenuis\) Reuter (Hemiptera: Miridae) and \(Lysiphlebus\) \(testaceipes\) (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae, Aphidiinae) are candidate biological control agents known to play an important role in the management of agricultural and horticultural pests in southern Europe. Through a series of laboratory and field assessments, this study investigates the establishment potential of these two species in cool temperate climates typical of northern Europe. Laboratory results demonstrated a low level of cold tolerance in \(N.\) \(tenuis\) with a developmental threshold of 12.9°C and no indication of ability to diapause. Field trials supported these findings with 100% mortality occurring after less than 4 weeks of winter field exposure. Collectively, these data suggest that \(N.\) \(tenuis\) is unlikely to establish outdoors in northern Europe and would therefore have little or no non-target effects on native species in such regions, thereby constituting a ‘safe’ candidate for release. Additionally, investigations into temperature-related thresholds indicated that \(N.\)\(tenuis\) would be an effective control agent against species with a similar activity profile to the two-spotted spider mite \(Tetranychus\) \(urticae\) Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). \(Lysiphlebus\) \(testaceipes\)demonstrated a greater ability to tolerate cold than \(N.\) \(tenuis\) but there was no indication of ability to diapause. With a developmental threshold of 5.8°C, parasitoid larvae and pupae continued to develop during the 70 d of winter field trials yielding reproductively viable adults. With this level of cold tolerance and a host range in excess of 100 aphid species, including some known to overwinter in the UK and other temperate regions, it seems reasonable to predict that \(L.\) \(testaceipes\) would be able to establish in northern Europe. Thermal activity threshold investigations also indicated that \(L.\) \(testaceipes\) would constitute an effective control agent for pest species with similar activity profiles to \(Aphis\) \(fabae\) Scop. (Hemiptera: Aphididae) under a range of climatic conditions. These data are discussed in relation to current debate on the environmental risk assessment and regulatory system in Europe for the release of non-native biological control agents.

T1  - Physiology and ecology of three amphipod species in uk estuaries
AN  - 899736913
AB  - The physiology and ecology of  Corophium volutator, Gammarus marinus  and  G. chevreuxi  were examined.Â  The physiological capacity was measured as the rate of oxygen consumption (MO2) in a variety of salinities with individuals of all size classes. Overall, larger individuals of all species exhibited lower MO2 by mass.Â   C. volutator  and  G. chevreuxi  exhibited lowest rates of respiration at salinities between 15 and 20ppt.Â   G. marinus  was found to have high mortality at 2 ppt, with high rates of respiration measured at 5 ppt.Â  A second set of physiology experiments examined the effect of acclimation temperature, salinity and seasonality on the temperature limits of the three amphipod species.Â  The critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and minimum (CTMin) were investigated using multiple endpoints for summer 2007 and winter 2008 using two test acclimation temperatures (10 and 20Â°C) and three test salinities (2, 20 and 35ppt).Â   C. volutator  had the highest CTMax, whereas  G. marinus  had the highest tolerance to cold temperatures with the largest temperature range.Â  The CTMin for male  G. chevreuxi  was significantly lower than for females.Â  The ecology of the three amphipod species was studied over a two year sampling period across 11 sites in three estuaries (Avon, Taw/Torridge and Plym).Â  A large amount of variation in the densities was noted with the sex ratios for all species biased towards females at all sites.Â  The density of  G. chevreuxi  fluctuated across site and date equally.Â   C. volutator  showed a strong spatial component and  G. marinus  showed a strong temporal component.Â  A model was developed to incorporate the results.Â  A Binary Logistic Regression approach was adapted and occupancy was found to be a strong predictor of presence/absence data for all 3 species.

T1  - The Impacts of Environmental Warming on the Ecology of British Dragonflies and Damselfies
AN  - 899732774
AB  - The evidence for rapid contemporary climate change is now irrefutable and regardless of whether or not this change is of anthropogenic origin the academic community has been presented with an opportunity to investigate the responses of the world's biota to changing temperature. I focus on three aspects of the ecology of Odonata: (i) historical trends from database records, (ii) geographical variation in morphology in relation to range location and (iii) the interaction between Odonata and their biotic and abiotic environment. Historical datasets - I demonstrate that the Odonata have shown a strong signal of advancing phenology through an analysis of historical records of sightings between 1960 and 2005. This is the first time such a shift in phenology has been demonstrated in an aquatic taxon and this shift is comparable to those observed in terrestrial taxa. The same database has also been used to evaluate distributional shifts in the Odonata. I show that the methods used in published studies of distributional changes that use unstructured datasets contain potential sources of error and make recommendations as to how these errors can be reduced. Finally, I investigate the extent to which distributional changes in Odonata will affect the use of this taxon as an indicator of water quality within the RIVPACS scheme. This demonstrates that artefacts can be introduced into assessments of water quality through not taking into account climate-induced range shifts as a contributing factor to changing species distributions. Variation in morphology - In the first of two pairs of studies I demonstrate that the varying rate at which three species are expanding their range in the UK is related to the degree of exaggeration in dispersal morphology at the range margin relative to the core of the range. The species expanding at the greatest rate demonstrated the greatest increase in dispersal-related traits at the expanding range margin. Using specimens of Calopteryx splendens that were collected as part of this study I give evidence for a variation in immune function between two populations in the south and north of England. In the second pair of studies I show that two sympatric damselfly species exhibit varying relationships between morphological traits and latitude. The species which is expanding its range shows classic latitude-size patterns whereas the species that is not expanding does not. Further to this I show that the wings of Coenagrion puella vary in shape towards the range margin in Scotland. I suggest that this may be the result of increased developmental instability close to the species' thermal limits. Odonata and the environment - As well as the broad historical changes in distributions that have been detected using databases of sighting, fine-scale research is required to describe the characteristics of the environment within which Odonata live. I test a number of hypotheses concerning the interactions between Odonata including the ability of different aspects of the environment to predict odonate community structure and the use of botanical communities as indicators of the nature of water bodies. Finally I examine the role of Odonata as a predator within the context of the invertebrate community in making predictions concerning the future of aquatic communities under varying hydroperiods. This demonstrates that vertebrate predators are susceptible to decreases in hydroperiod while dytiscid beetles, which exhibit the same dietary preferences, are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and are unaffected by drought.

T1  - Climatic influences on the evolution and diversity of regional species assemblages
AN  - 527854345
AB  - It has long been recognized that climate can influence the diversity and dynamics of communities and regional assemblages. Within this thesis, I ask three questions: (1) which processes are most important in mediating climate-species richness relationships; (2) are predictions of spatial climate-richness models temporally consistent, and (3) is local community structure determined primarily by regional or local processes.    Metabolic theory proposes that climate-richness relationships arise due to the temperature dependence of metabolic rate. I tested the theory's predictions for six taxa in North America. Contrary to the theory's predictions, temperature-richness relationships were curvilinear and their slopes deviated from the predicted value. This suggests that the mechanism proposed by metabolic theory does not underlie climate-richness relationships.    If climate determines species richness, then climate should predict how species richness will change over time. To test this, I compared alternative methods (regression and niche modelling) of forecasting shifts in species richness given global climate change. Models were trained on butterfly richness data from the early 20th century and their predictions were compared to observed changes throughout the 20th century. Overall, regression-based approaches that incorporated spatial autocorrelation outperformed other methods.    Broad-scale richness gradients could arise from climatic niche conservatism. I tested this hypothesis for treefrogs (Hylidae) by combining data on species' distributions and phylogeny. I found that while niches were conserved with respect to cold tolerance, species richness was determined by precipitation, not temperature. This suggests that the processes determining regional species composition and richness are controlled by fundamentally different climatic components.    I evaluated the relative importance of regional and local processes and how there were affected by climatic gradients by examining patterns of body size dispersion at local and regional scales for hylid frogs. On average, communities were over-dispersed, but there was no increased signature of competition in the tropics. Dispersion of regional assemblages decreased in cold areas, but this was not due to an elevated tropical rate of body size evolution. Overall, regional processes explained twice as much variance in body size dispersion than did local processes.    This thesis rejected several hypotheses for the link between climate and macroevolutionary patterns. In doing so, it provided new insight to the role of ecological and evolutionary processes along broad-climatic gradients.

T1  - Free-living <i>Symbiodinium</i>: Genetic diversity and availability for acquisition by asymbiotic coral larvae
AN  - 305173499
AB  - Symbiodinium, a unicellular dinoflagellate, is crucial to the survival of symbiotic invertebrate hosts like corals. In some cases, the type of Symbiodinium a host associates with can affect host thermal tolerance and physiological processes. Some species of hosts may be able to switch their symbiont type to acclimate to changing environmental conditions. New, diverse types of Symbiodinium might be available for symbiotic hosts to uptake from free-living Symbiodinium populations. Thus the diversity of free-living Symbiodinium is of particular interest in the face of increasingly frequent and widespread coral bleaching events, primarily caused by increases in sea temperature. This thesis compared the genetic diversity of free-living Symbiodinium  in the water column and sediments of coral reefs of Hawai'i, the Florida Keys, and Okinawa Japan. 41 Symbiodinium cp23S-HVR sequence variants were identified and grouped into clades A, B, C, D, F, and G; 24 of these sequence variants were novel. Results indicate that free-living  Symbiodinium communities are diverse and have complex overlaps between habitats and regions and with symbiotic communities. In addition, tank experiments were conducted to test whether asymbiotic larvae of the coral Acropora monticulosa preferentially acquired free-living Symbiodinium  from the water column or sediments to establish their symbiosis. Results from this experiment clearly showed free-living Symbiodinium  were acquired by asymbiotic larvae earlier, in greater proportion and with greater in hospite Symbiodinium densities in sediment-containing treatments when compared to seawater-only treatments. These two studies revealed that free-living Symbiodinium communities are diverse with intricate patterns of distribution and that sediments may represent an important source of free-living Symbiodinium for establishing symbiosis with invertebrate hosts. The data obtained in this thesis can be used in future studies to help determine interactions of free-living Symbiodinium  community with their symbiotic counterpart and with symbiotic hosts to help predict the response of Symbiodinium and the symbiotic hosts to climate change.

T1  - The influence of temperature on the physiology and feeding behavior of the invasive pike killifish, <i>Belonesox belizanus,</i> in south Florida
AN  - 305086292
AB  - Belonesox belizanus Kner 1860 was released into a Florida canal in Miami-Dade County in 1957; it has since spread across most of south Florida, including the Everglades National Park. In an attempt to investigate how environmental factors may limit the distribution and abundance of invasive species through the constraints they impose on organismal physiology and behavior, this study was designed to determine: (1) the influence of local environmental conditions on the density of B. belizanus; (2) the stage- and location-specific differences in thermal tolerance of B. belizanus ; and (3) the stage- and location-specific effects of temperature on the feeding behavior of B. belizanus.    Three major findings result from this study. First, among the environmental factors examined, the magnitude of inter-annual change in temperature was correlated with inter-annual change in B. belizanus density. This pattern of covariance between habitat temperature and B. belizanus  density served as the basis for designing experiments to test hypotheses on the direct and indirect effects of temperature on the behavior and physiology of the non-native B. belizanus in south Florida.    Second, life-history stages have similarities in their thermal tolerances; however, juvenile B. belizanus maintained lower thermal tolerance limits across different acclimation temperatures compared with adults and neonates. In addition, adult B. belizanus from the northern edge of their south Florida distribution stopped feeding at lower temperatures relative to their southern conspecifics. These results imply that  H. belizanus may have a thermally plastic phenotype (e.g., physiology) that gives individuals the ability to spread through thermally heterogeneous habitats, and that juveniles are the potential dispersal life-history stage of this invasive species.    Third, prey-capture behavior and kinematics across ontogeny are affected by temperature. Juveniles had similar attack velocities as adults across acclimation temperatures; however, juveniles had the quickest feeding strike across all temperatures Based on Q10 estimations, neonate prey-capture kinematics were affected by a temperature change from 30 to 25°C, whereas adults' and juveniles' feeding behaviors remained unaffected across the same temperature change. It is hypothesized that the thermally tolerant, physiologically and behaviorally plastic juvenile B. belizanus allows the spread of this invasive species across thermally heterogeneous habitats in south Florida.

T1  - <i>Drosophila</i> larvae: Thermal ecology in changing environments
AN  - 305014989
AB  - Temperature affects almost all aspects of life. Although much work has been done to assess the impact of temperature on organismal performance, relatively little is known about how organisms behaviorally regulate temperature, how these behaviors effect population fitness, or how changing climate may interact with these behaviors. I explore these questions with the model system  Drosophila larvae. Larvae are small, with a low thermal mass and limited capacity for physiological thermoregulation. Mortality is generally high in larvae, with large potential impacts on population growth rate. Thus behavioral thermoregulation in larvae should be of critical selective importance. I present a review of the current knowledge of Drosophila thermal preference. I describe quantifiable thermoregulatory behaviors ( TMV and TW) unique to larvae. I show interspecific variation of these behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster  and several close relatives, and intraspecific variation between populations collected from different environments. I also investigate these behaviors in two mutant lines, ssa and  biz, to investigate the genetic basis of these behaviors. I show that larval thermoregulatory systems are independent of those of adults. Further these thermoregulatory behaviors differ between two sister species,  D. yakuba and D. santomea. Although these two species readily hybridize in laboratory conditions, very few hybrids are observed in the field. The surprising result that hybrids of D. yakuba and D. santomea seem to inherit TMV from D. yakuba suggests a novel extrinsic isolation mechanism between the two species. I explore how fitness is the result of the interaction between genetics and the environment. I utilize Monte Carlo simulation to show how non-linear norms of reaction generate variation in populations even in the absence of behavior or epigenetic evolutionary mechanisms. Finally I investigate the global distribution of temperatures in which these organisms exist using novel frequency space techniques. These new techniques will allow us to simultaneously characterize linear trends, daily and yearly climate cycling, climate stochasticity, and the spatial distribution of these characteristics. In these investigations, I have attempted to apply an integrative approach to the problem of how molecular mechanisms, development, and behavior interact with the thermal environment to produce successful populations.

T1  - The role of coral's algal symbionts in coral reef adaptation to climate change
AN  - 304999949
AB  - Coral reef ecosystems are fundamentally supported by an intracellular symbiosis between the coral animal and a dinoflagellate alga in the genus Symbiodinium. Reef corals in turn support human economies and some of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. These ecosystems are critically threatened by climate change as temperatures and ocean acidity increase.   However, reef corals have a means of adaptation not available to most organisms–shifts in the populations of their intracellular dinoflagellate symbionts. The dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium is genetically and physiologically diverse, with different algae occurring in distinct habitats and showing distinct physiological tolerances. By changing their complement of Symbiodinium, corals may be able shift their environmental tolerances, and therefore at least partially adapt to climate change.   This thesis focuses on the role that the Symbiodinium may play in reef-building coral's adaptation to climate change. I first examine how distinct Symbiodinium types appear to associate with different thermal habitats on a small scale (∼ 200 m). I then show that many coral species accommodate heat-resistant algal lines in an area where such algae are present and environmental conditions are stressful (e.g. temperatures are elevated). Expanding to a global review, I show that both these patterns are true on a global scale: many corals host multiple Symbiodinium  clades, and heat-resistant symbionts are more commonly found in hot, acidic environments. I then use selection experiments to show that although corals hosting the more heat-resistant symbionts do appear to have elevated thermal thresholds, the degree of elevation is not enough to prevent mortality during a simulated 21-century scale heat stress event. However, corals that both host heat-resistant Symbiodinium strains and have been acclimatized to previous heat stress survive even the severe heat stress.    These results, taken together, suggest that a wide array of corals is capable of shifting their algal populations to support algae that show local and global preference for hotter and more acidic conditions–conditions we are increasingly likely to see as climate change progresses. Although these algae will play an important adaptive role, the thesis also highlights some clear limitations to this role. In describing the areas of the globe in which conditions favor the occurrence of heat-resistant algae, we show that current conditions in many coral-reef areas do not favor the long-term establishment of these algae. Also, the experimental work shows that, although heat-resistant algae can boost coral's thermal tolerances, if corals are to survive the worst heating events, multiple adaptive processes may have to occur simultaneously, including shifts in algal populations, acclimatization to harsh microhabitats, and potentially adaptive changes in the coral's physiology. In the last chapter we apply genomic techniques to study environmental adaptation in the model sea urchin system, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. With the advent of inexpensive high-throughput sequencing technologies, these techniques are rapidly becoming more relevant outside model systems, and, over the next two years, we will be using them to probe the environmental adaptation of reef corals.   We examine the imprint of environmental adaptation in the genomes of  Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Allocentrotus fragilis,  two sea urchins that live in dramatically different environments: specifically, the highly variable and turbulent intertidal zone and the cold, dark, high-pressure deep sea. By comparing genomic sequences of these two organisms and detecting local overabundances of substitutions that cause changes in protein sequence, we can identify genes that have been acted upon by natural selection to promote functional differences. We identify ∼ 3% of genes in the sea urchin genome that show such signatures of positive natural selection, and demonstrate that environmental adaptation played an important role in the functional divergence of these species.

T1  - Development of measurement and modeling techniques to quantify atmospheric deposition of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals in the Great Lakes
AN  - 304951821
AB  - Measurement and modeling techniques were developed to improve over-water gaseous air-water exchange measurements for persistent bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals (PBTs). Analytical methods were applied to atmospheric measurements of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Additionally, the sampling and analytical methods are well suited to study semivolatile organic compounds (SOCs) in air with applications related to secondary organic aerosol formation, urban, and indoor air quality.    A novel gas-phase cleanup method is described for use with thermal desorption methods for analysis of atmospheric SOCs using multicapillary denuders. The cleanup selectively removed hydrogen-bonding chemicals from samples, including much of the background matrix of oxidized organic compounds in ambient air, and thereby improved precision and method detection limits for nonpolar analytes.    A model is presented that predicts gas collection efficiency and particle collection artifact for SOCs in multicapillary denuders using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sorbent. An approach is presented to estimate the equilibrium PDMS-gas partition coefficient (Kpdms) from an Abraham solvation parameter model for any SOC.    A high flow rate (300 L min-1) multicapillary denuder was designed for measurement of trace atmospheric SOCs. Overall method precision and detection limits were determined using field duplicates and compared to the conventional high-volume sampler method. The high-flow denuder is an alternative to high-volume or passive samplers when separation of gas and particle-associated SOCs upstream of a filter and short sample collection time are advantageous.    A Lagrangian internal boundary layer transport exchange (IBLTE) Model is described. The model predicts the near-surface variation in several quantities with fetch in coastal, offshore flow: (1) modification in potential temperature and gas mixing ratio, (2) surface fluxes of sensible heat, water vapor, and trace gases using the NOAA COARE Bulk Algorithm and Gas Transfer Model, (3) vertical gradients in potential temperature and mixing ratio. The model was applied to interpret micrometeorological measurements of air-water exchange flux of HCB and several PCB congeners in Lake Superior. The IBLTE Model can be applied to any scalar, including water vapor, carbon dioxide, dimethyl sulfide, and other scalar quantities of interest with respect to hydrology, climate, and ecosystem science.

T1  - Plastic versus fixed influences on coral response to fluctuating environmental conditions: Sources of coral resilience and stress tolerance in a changing climate
AN  - 304894300
AB  - The degree to which coral reef ecosystems will be impacted by global climate change depends on regional and local differences in corals' susceptibility and resilience to environmental stressors. This dissertation attempts to investigate the physiological basis behind the unique stress tolerance of a group of back reef corals that experience daily environmental extremes thought to cause bleaching and mortality in most corals. I examined the response of a suite of stress protein biomarkers in the common reef coral Pontes lobata  from multiple back reef sites and a neighboring forereef on Ofu and Olosega Islands, American Samoa, using field reciprocal transplant experiments (RTEs) and controlled laboratory manipulations. Additionally, I examined the genetic diversity of P. lobata hosts and their algal symbionts in both back reef and forereef populations to assess the degree of gene-flow between areas and the influence of symbiont genotype on coral response. RTEs performed during the southern summer revealed a combination of both fixed and environmental influence on biomarker response. Fixed influences were strongest for ubiquitin-conjugated proteins with consistently higher levels found in back reef versus forereef source colonies both pre and post transplant; suggesting a greater amount of or capacity to process irreversible protein denaturation in back reef corals. Algal endosymbiont populations were genetically indistinguishable between the forereef and back reef sites based on nuclear ribosomal DNA, while genetic analyses of nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial loci of the coral host revealed both large scale (<100 km) and small scale (>1 km) population subdivision. Fixed and environmental influences on biomarker responses were consistent over seasonal and long-term changes, with a significant reduction in ubiquitin-conjugates during winter versus summer seasons when daily extremes in back reef characteristics were lowest. Controlled acclimation experiments demonstrated that coral thermal tolerance increased following exposure to fluctuating versus stable temperatures, although back reef corals still exhibited elevated thermal tolerance compared to forereef corals despite acclimation treatments. These experiments demonstrate that exposure to environmental variability promotes coral stress tolerance at both the level of phenotypic plasticity as well as over longer time-scales through epigenetic changes to or evolutionary adaptation of the coral stress response.

T1  - Molecular ecology of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus <i>Symbiodinium</i>) in scleractinian corals
AN  - 304863574
AB  - Mutualistic association expands the ecological niches and physiological tolerances of both hosts and their symbionts. The evolutionary process of symbiotic organisms has great creative potential, particularly in responding to selective environmental pressures, since a functionally distinct holobiont (i.e., composite "organism" that includes all symbiotic partners) arises from each combination of host and symbiont genetic types. Coral-algal symbioses are an ideal system for testing the contributions of host and symbiont diversity to holobiont niche space and metabolic tolerance, because both corals and their resident dinoflagellate algal endosymbionts (genus: Symbiodinium ) contain extensive genetic diversity, and therefore, many functionally different holobionts are possible. In total, I analyzed Symbiodinium  assemblages in ∼400 samples representing 18 scleractinian coral species from the western Atlantic (Bahamas, Belize, Bermuda, Dominican Republic, Panama, and the U.S. Florida Keys and Virgin Islands) and eastern Pacific (Panamá). The following molecular identification methods were applied to this purpose: Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of the large subunit (28S) rDNA, Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) of the internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) region of the rDNA, and molecular sequencing. Four novel clade-specific qPCR primer sets were developed and tested, and an assay was optimized, to detect the full diversity of  Symbiodinium clades (A – D) which are the typical symbionts of scleractinian corals worldwide. These primers and assay represent a 100- to 1000-fold improvement in sensitivity over conventional methods. Mixed symbiont assemblages were detected in 80% (N = 232 of 289) of the samples analyzed using qPCR, compared to only ∼25% documented by other studies using conventional methods (RFLP and DGGE). Furthermore, qPCR demonstrated that RFLP results are a poor indicator of whether individual hosts contain symbiont monocultures or communities. Therefore, the total  Symbiodinium diversity hosted by individual scleractinian coral species/colonies has likely been greatly underestimated by conventional detection methods. Results also showed that holobionts characterized by high relative abundances of Symbiodinium in clade D are correlated with relatively warm environments (suggesting increased thermo-tolerance of the holobiont) and disease resistance. Monitoring of Symbiodinium  assemblages within individual colonies over time indicated that symbiont communities are dynamic, suggesting metabolic plasticity of individual holobionts which may result in the ability to occupy more diverse niches. This has positive implications for the ability of coral-algal holobionts to adapt/acclimatize to increasing temperatures driven by anthropogenic climate change. To evaluate whether Symbiodinium ITS-2 types represent meaningful sequence variation, an alternative cluster-based approach for designating  Symbiodinium "species" based on these data was proposed and tested against the "types as species" model. This cluster-based approach dramatically reduced "species" diversity in Symbiodinium from ∼175 to 35 species, and tests generally indicated ecological differentiation exists between these cluster-based "species", but not within them. Finally, a potential (asexual) mechanism for diversification and divergence within Symbiodinium  was proposed. Taken together, this work suggests that symbiont diversity plays a key role in the increased ecological and evolutionary potential and plasticity of holobionts, and that the total symbiont diversity present within hosts should be considered when forecasting the trajectories of holobionts under selective pressure.

T1  - Physiological responses to environmental variability in <i>Mytilus</i> mussels
AN  - 304855677
AB  - This research addresses the relationship between environmental conditions, ecological patterns, and physiological stress characteristics in two eastern Pacific mussel congeners, Mytilus galloprovincialis  and Mytilus trossulus. While M. trossulus  is native to the region, M. galloprovincialis is an invasive species introduced to the eastern Pacific nearly a century ago. The two species overlap in range and compete for resources in central California, but species abundances are largely segregated across habitats and latitude. It is thought that differential environmental tolerances may play a significant role in setting the distributions of these species.   Using a combination of field surveys and molecular laboratory analyses, this research correlated environmental conditions with physiological functioning to identify how evolved tolerances map on to ecological patterns. Results support the hypothesis that M. galloprovincialis and  M. trossulus differ in their environmental tolerances. The native species exhibited more cool-adapted and euryhaline traits, while the invader suggested a more stenohaline and warm-adapted physiology. These differences were observed in stress response profiles across seasons, habitats, and laboratory acclimations. In Bodega Bay, CA, field surveys also showed the two species to segregate across littoral zones, a pattern which had not previously been reported and has significant implications for future monitoring of these species.    An analysis of field condition across latitude was also undertaken using  M. galloprovincialis, intended to measure the extent and nature of acclimatization patterns across large spatial scales. The study found  M. galloprovincialis to vary in standing stocks of stress proteins across sites, correlated with relative water temperatures in each region. The relationship between constitutive stress proteins and the inducible "heat shock" response was also explored and results suggested that constitutive proteins may provide a protective role in high-stress environments.   These studies collectively help to characterize the physiological traits that may underlie many of the distribution patterns observed between M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. By considering questions of ecology and individual functioning within the context of one another, these types of macro-physiological studies may inform our understanding of the M. galloprovincialis invasion, and perhaps also address larger ecological questions such as species ranges, competition, and responses of organisms to climate change.

T1  - The physiological response of larval marine snails to environmental stressors
AN  - 304853057
AB  - Embryonic and larval stages are thought to be more sensitive to environmental fluctuations than later life history stages. Therefore, examining how marine larval gastropods might be affected by climate change stressors, in this case, high temperatures and ocean acidification (OA), becomes important for predicting long-term outcomes such as recruitment success and population structure.   This study first examined the effects of temperature on larval survival of the intertidal dogwhelk, Nucella ostrina, over a large geographic scale. Laboratory trials concluded that veliger survival decreased abruptly within a few degrees celsius for all sites. In addition, there was a significant relationship between veliger thermal tolerance and latitude, but habitat temperature and veliger thermal tolerance were not correlated. Data further yielded that some larval populations may be living near their upper thermal limit, and as sea surface temperatures continue to rise with climate change, a couple of degrees could impact the population structure of these encapsulated developers.    A growing body of research on calcifying marine invertebrates suggests that OA can have deleterious effects on development and various physiological processes in these organisms, especially since climate change models predict oceanic pH could decrease by additional 0.2-0.3 units (from pH 8.1 to an average of 7.9-7.8) by the year 2100. In laboratory experiments designed to mimic seawater chemistry in future oceans, we examined the effects of elevated CO 2 on larvae of two marine snails, Nucella ostrina and  Haliotis rufescens. Larvae were raised in culture under control and experimental CO2 levels that span the range of current atmospheric CO2 concentrations (385 ppm) to a "worst case" scenario (∼990 ppm) predicted for the year 2100. Following development under conditions of ocean acidification, we measured larval thermal tolerance, shell integrity and shell formation. Our results showed elevated CO2 had a subtle influence on veliger thermal tolerance for both species. In addition, shell strength in Nucella ostrina veligers and gene expression patterns for genes involved in shell formation in abalone larvae were not changed. These results suggest that larval forms of these species may have the capacity to withstand environmental change.

T1  - Study on dessication tolerance and storage behavior of cinnamomum camphora (linn.) presl seed
AN  - 1869993426
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorIn this thesis, the change of biological properties of Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl seed during development, the difference of desiccation sensitivity and the relative physiological-biochemical mechanism of mature seeds under different drying conditions at room temperature were examined. The effect of stratification under at different low temperature on seed germination and the changes of correlated physiological-biochemical characteristics were also investigated. The whole growth period of Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl seed is about 210 d. During development, the biological properties of seed including the color of fruit, fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW), moisture content etc undergo remarkable changes: the size of fruit comes to the maximum with the diameter of 0.98 cm as seed developed to 150 DAA (Days after anthesis), but the seed continues to grow up until it reaches physiological maturation at 210 DAA, at that time the fruit becomes black and shining, fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW) per 1000 seeds are about 186.42 g and 138.90 g respectively, and seed moisture content is approximately 0.33 gH2O g-1 DW. Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl seeds were dehydrated by silica gel (rapid drying) and nature wind drying (slow drying). During the period of drying, the relationship between the speed of dehydration and seed desiccation tolerance or sensitivity were evaluated by investigating the changes of seed germination,vigor index,electrolytic conductivity of seed soaked solution,contents of storage materials such as soluble sugars, proteins and of the activity of some enzymes etc. The results showed that either by silica gel drying (rapid drying, RD) or by natural wind drying(slow drying, SD)at room temperature, electrolytic conductivity of seed soaked solution presented a tendency of gradually ascending. However, the extent of dehydration through different drying patterns threw different effects on seed germination, responding to the initial slight desiccation (down to about 0.25gH2O g-1 DW), seeds reached a higher germination percentage of 90.0% and 67.0% with the treatment of RD and SD respectively; As seed germination percentage increased, SOD,CAT,POD activity also rose quickly; But following the extent of desiccation exacerbated, seed vigor declined gradually; at the same time, the content of MDA of seed steeply rose, the activity of SOD,CAT,POD of seed descended, and electrolytic conductivity of seed soaked solution kept elevating. It was suggested that companied by aggravated dehydration, the system of safeguard enzymes were destroyed, free radicals in seed could not be removed in time, membrane lipid peroxidation, and membrane integrity were accelerated and finally caused seed vigor gradually declining. However, at the time seed moisture content dropped towards a steady status, the seed germination percentage was still higher than that of those prior to desiccation treatment, the reason for it might be the case that C.camphora seed has dormancy to certain extent, and dehydration can release seed dormancy; on the other hand, C. camphora (Linn.) Presl seed possesses desiccation tolerance to a certain degree, though seed became injured seriously by further dehydration after seed moisture content was less than 0.25 g H2O g-1DW, and the seeds withstanding SD suffered more serious damage comparing to those desiccated by RD to the same moisture content. Sand stratification at low temperature above 0℃ can release dormancy of C. Camphora (Linn.) Presl seeds effectively, the stratification time for seeds reaching to the maximum germination percentage shortened at higher temperature, but after that time their vigor declined more rapidly; while those seeds stratified in sand below 0℃ died quickly. It was suggested that substances which may impede seed to germinate were excluded or broke down effectively during the stratification, which initiated the physiological program of germination of C.Camphora (Linn.)

T1  - Heterochronic genes regulate the lifespan of caenorhabditis elegans and the expression in the development of mouse
AN  - 1869034498
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorHeterochronic genes control the temporal and spatial pattern of entire development process and specify the cell fate to ensure accurate position of the various organs and developmental time. In heterochronic genes mutation, stage-specific developmental events occur at earlier or later stages than they would normally. MicroRNAs and other heterochronic genes play key roles in regulating cell proliferation, cell development and apoptosis, as well as in controlling lifespan, tumor genesis and other diseases. In this paper, we used RNAi, lifespan analysis, western blot, immunoprecipitation and RT-PCR to study heterochronic genes in regulating C.elegans lifespan, and the expression pattern of the homologus genes lin-28 and lin-41 in vertebrate. First, the lifespan and temperature tolerance of different heterochronic genes mutantions were analysed and found that the lin-28 mutant lived longer than N2 wild type. The mutants of let-7 and lin-41 lived shorter than N2 wild type. There was no significant difference in the lifespan of lin-29 mutant compared with N2 wild type. The lifespan of daf-2(-) and daf-16(-) were analysed after lin-28 RNAi. The results showed that the lifespan of daf-2, lin-28 double mutant lived longer than a single mutant of daf-2, and there was no significant difference in daf-16(-), lin-28(-) double mutant compared with daf-16 single mutant, also the nuclear localization of DAF-16::GFP did not change significantly after lin-28 RNA interference. The expression of LIN-28 in short and long lifespan of worms was detected by western blot. The data showed that long lifespan of worms, including daf-2 mutant, the expression level of LIN-28 was low. In short lifespan of worms, including daf-16 mutant, expression level of LIN-28 was higher. In addition, Co-IP and RNAi were used to detect the interaction between daf-16 and lin-28. The results implied that lin-28 may perform a new function in regulating the lifespan of C.elegans by affecting daf-16. LIN-28 and DAF-16 could interact with each other. Over-expression of LIN-28 may inhibit the expression of DAF-16, and LIN-28 had abundance expression in daf-16(-) mutant. Immunoprecipitation and MALDI-TOF-MS were used to identify the proteins that interact with LIN-28. The results showed that the proteins may interact with LIN-28, including T22H9.3, a translation initiation factor 2C (eIF-2C), P granule protein PGL-2, hypothetical protein R13A1.10 and Aff_ZK484.8. The interaction between DAF-16 and LIN-14 which related to the lifespan regulation through the insulin/IGF-1 pathway was detected in the experiments.The study showed that in the background of daf-2 mutation, if lin-14 was loss of function, the expression of DAF-16 was increased; using immunoprecipitation and western blot, we found lin-14 could interact with daf-16; four proteins were identified which may interacted with LIN-14, including Y55-F3C.9, R12E2.1, C50C3.7 and mitochondrial ATP-inhibitor. In vertebrates, mouse lin-41 and lin-28 partial cDNA fragments were successfully amplified from the mouse embryonic day 9(E9.0) mRNA by RT-PCR. lin-28 and lin-41 cDNA were cloned into expression vector PET-32M for prokaryotic expression. The expression of LIN-41 and LIN-28 in mouse tissues and embryos from day 9 to 13 were detected by using RT-PCR and western blot. RT-PCR results showed that: lin-41mRNA was firstly detected in the embryo of day 9, then in day 10.5 and day 12 respectively, lin-28mRNA was firstly detected in the embryo of day 9 and day 10.5. Western blot results showed that the specific expression of LIN-41 were in the mouse heart, muscle, small intestine and day 9 to 12 embryo. LIN-28 was detected in the embryo of day 9, 10.5 and 12, also in the adult mouse heart, kidney, liver, muscle, small intestine and brain. In addition, more abundant expression of LIN-28 was detected in mouse heart and small intestine than in other tissues. Finally, Co-Immunoprecipitation combine MALDI-TOF-MASS was used to identify the potential proteins interacting with LIN-41, the results showed that several proteins may interact with LIN-41 in mouse, including leucine zipper transcription factor, epidermal growth factor receptor, hemagglutinin-4 (Galectin-4), mitochondria and Ras-related protein
