T1  - The reproductive ecology of Antarctic free-spawning molluscs. (BL: DXN050882)
AN  - 898761271
AB  - This study on the free-spawning Antarctic limpet Nacella concinna and soft-shelled clam Laternula elliptica has revealed new information about reproduction in these species.  N. concinna and L. elliptica show long-term and continuous reproductive strategies over their mature lifetime.  Gametogenic cycles last Â�18 to 24 months leading to overlapping cohorts of oocytes within the same ovary.  The initiation of gametogenesis coincides with the spring phytoplankton bloom.  Vitellogenesis and spermiogenesis take Â�12 months.  Reproductive processes continue over the austral winter fuelled by body reserves.  Spawning is annual for N. concinna coinciding with the spring bloom, a strategy expressed by related Nacella spp. inhabiting the Southern Ocean.  L. elliptica appears to have multiple spawning events in a year.  The timing of the major spawning events in geographically isolated populations of L. elliptica moves from late summer to mid-winter across a latitudinal cline (from higher to lower latitudes).  Annual reproductive effort in both species varies in response to the inter-annual variability in environmental conditions.Antarctic free-spawners require Â�100 times more sperm to achieve the same levels of fertilization success as temperate and tropical free-spawners.  Specific spawning behaviour are required to enhance success (e.g. synchronous release and spawning aggregations).  The investment in individual sperm may be balanced by the extreme longevity of the sperm.  Temperatures and salinities outside the normal tolerance range of the animals reduces fertilization success and increases abnormal development.  The highly stenothermal and stenohalinic gametes and early life stages act to delimit the geographical distribution of these species around Antarctica.  Narrow tolerance limits and showed gametogenic and developmental processes make free-spawners extremely vulnerable to environmental change (as predicted by global warming models).  The development rates of Antarctic molluscs can be 15-18 times greater than temperate and tropical molluscs.  Reproductive processes, fertilization and embryonic development in Antarctic bivalves and possibly in other Antarctic invertebrates shows no temperature compensation.

T1  - Heat shock protein expression in acute lethal Clara cell injury and the development of tolerance
AN  - 304684998
AB  - Toxic injury in the lung can come from a variety of sources. Xenobiotics can act directly in the lung, such as ozone, or may require metabolism into toxic intermediates by Clara cells, the primary metabolically active cells within the lung. Naphthalene (NA), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon abundant in tobacco smoke and the emissions of the internal combustion engine, is a prototypical bioactivated Clara cell toxicant. Much is known about the progression of acute Clara cell injury after a single exposure to NA as well as the in the development of tolerance to repeated exposures to NA. In contrast, relatively little is known about the expression pattern of potentially protective proteins during the acute injury and development of tolerance. The objective of this dissertation was to investigate the expression of one such class of proteins, heat shock proteins (Hsps), in the lung after acute NA-induced Clara cell injury and in the development of the tolerant lung. Further, their expression is related to changes in airway epithelial intracellular glutathione (GSH) pools.    Expression of Hsps in Clara cells after acute NA injury precedes the onset of organelle alterations by ultrastructure, but is closely tied to the onset of GSH depletion and protein adduction by metabolites of NA. Expression is down-regulated after cell exfoliation, during repair. Early in the development of tolerance (1–3 days exposure), there is continued up-regulation of Hsps in the target epithelium. After 4–7 days of consecutive NA exposure Hsps are down-regulated, coincident with the reported up-regulation of GSH biosynthesis. We established the importance of GSH levels to induction of Hsp synthesis in airway epithelial cells. When GSH is depleted from the airway epithelium using the non-toxic chemical depletor diethylmaleate (DEM), there is rapid up-regulation of Hsp 72 in association with intracellular GSH depletion. Lastly, we show that the actin cytoskeleton of Clara cells is altered in response to NA injury. The small Hsp, Hsp 25, co-localizes with the cytoskeletal fraction by Western blot analysis and shifts in distribution in the bronchiolar ciliated cells toward the cell periphery in response to the disrupted Clara cell actin 2hrs post-NA.

T1  - Development of expressed sequence tags (ESTS) and cDNA microarrays for analysis of differentially expressed genes in the channel catfish (<i>Ictalurus punctatus</i>) brain
AN  - 304680626
AB  - The objectives of this research were to develop expressed sequence tags from the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) brain and to develop microarray technologies for analysis of differentially expressed genes in the brain in response to cold acclimation. Expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis was conducted using a cDNA library made from the brain mRNA of channel catfish. ESTs were used to develop microarray technology to determine differentially expressed genes to reveal molecular mechanisms of cold acclimation. A total 1,201 brain cDNA clones that represented 660 unique genes were analyzed for transcriptome analysis in catfish to develop molecular reagents for cDNA microarray analysis to reveal molecular mechanisms of cold acclimation. Of the 660 unique genes, 330 clones were identified as known genes by BLAST searches and 330 clones as unknown genes.    Among 660 analyzed genes, 62 were differentially expressed at 12°C as compared to 24°C. The gene induction upon temperature shift was rapid within two hours. The major categories of differentially expressed genes include: (1) chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein, (2) transcription factors and genes involved in signal transduction pathways such as zinc finger proteins, calmodulin kinase inhibitor, the nuclear autoantigen SG2NA, interferon regulatory factor 3, and inorganic pyrophosphatase, (3) genes involved in lipid metabolism such as TB2 and acyl CoA binding protein, and (4) genes involved in the translational machinery such as ribosomal proteins. Some genes were induced transiently, whereas others were induced in a durable fashion. Several genes were down regulated among which were mainly ribosomal protein genes, indicating reduced metabolic activity with extended incubation at the low temperature. This research indicated that catfish respond to low temperature by adjusting expression of a large number of genes. The rapid induction of proteins involved in signal transductions and chaperones suggest that both  de novo synthesis of cold-induced proteins and modification of existing proteins are required in adaptation and tolerance of fish to low temperature environment.

T1  - A study of extra-cellular phytases of potential commerical interest.
AN  - 301637808
AB  - An assay for supplemental feed phytase was developed based upon radial diffusion of the enzyme-containing feed extract through an agar gel in which the phytic acid substrate had been dissolved. A linear relationship between the diameter of the zone of substrate hydrolyzed and the log of enzyme activity present was observed. A lower detection limit of 0.0008 units/ml was obtained, which surpasses the detection limit required for commercial use by 12.5 fold. The assay described should prove of use for quality control purposes in the feed industry, as no such assay has been reported to date in the peer-reviewed literature.The assay developed was used to investigate the effects of (laboratory-scale) thermal processing on in-feed phytase activity. Incubation of supplemented feed under conditions simulating the monogastric animal digestive tract resulted in a total activity loss of 58% ±9%.Six fungal strains were screened on phytase screening media and all were found to produce extracellular phytase activity. On the basis of (crude) enzyme thermal stability and pH versus activity profiles, two were chosen for further study. Extracellular phytase from Aspergillus niger ATCC 9142 and Rhizopus oligosporus ATCC 22959, was purified to homogeneity using a combination of ion exchange, gel filtration & chromatofocusing. The enzymes displayed a molecular mass of 85 and 120 KDa respectively. Both were glycoproteins, with carbohydrate contents of 27.67% and 30.55% respectively. They recorded Km values of 110ìM and 10.4 ìM respectively and RP-HPLC analysis of substrate degradation products indicated both were 3-phytases. Both were considerably more thermostable than the commercial phytase 'natuophos', retaining 22% and 35% residual activity as compared to 6% for natuophos when heated to 80°C for 3 minutes. Both also displayed activity over a broader pH range when compared to natuophos. The results presented indicate that these enzymes would be of likely commercial interest.

T1  - Low temperature storage and cryopreservation of hoverflies as biological control agents
AN  - 301600943
AB  - Larvae of the syrphids Episyrphus balteatus and Syrphus ribesii (Diptera; Syrphidae) are important natural enemies of aphids and may be useful as biological control agents.  Since these species are difficult and expensive to rear, storage protocols would make their use in biological control easier and less expensive.  Freeze tolerant Syrphus ribesii larvae can be stored for 150 days with 75% survival, and an emergence rate of adult flies, which is comparable to the control.  Feeding during storage and the warming regime after storage can affect both the numbers of flies which emerge, and the time taken to do so.  During the acclimation and storage procedure a proportion of the population lose their freeze tolerance and show the ability to supercool.  This loss of freeze tolerance can also be observed in larvae subjected to multiple cycles of freezing and thawing.  Episyrphus balteatus larvae are not freeze tolerant, but the eggs of this species may be suitable for cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen.  It is possible to dechorionate the eggs with high survival.  The eggs can also be permeabilised, although no larvae emerged from eggs which had undergone this procedure.

T1  - Sustainable urban housing in Kathmandu, Nepal: Proposals and evaluations
AN  - 275861615
AB  - Kathmandu Valley represents one of the oldest cultural hubs in the Himalayas. The historic towns in the valley consist of densely built traditional Chowk and Bahal houses with enclosed courtyards. With exposure to the outside world since 1951, the western style single-family detached house has become an image of the modern home and a status symbol. In the context of the exploding population, the prevailing trend of these free standing houses have exacerbated urban sprawl and led to inefficient use of the limited agricultural land in the valley. Devoid of shared open spaces, the new settlements lack play areas for children, places for social gathering and a sense of community.    Building materials that are not manufactured locally must be trucked from India over the mountains. So is coal for the production of brick and cement, and diesel for transportation. Minimizing the amount of imported materials and energy used by these modern houses will reduce the environmental impact and also benefit the national economy.    Kathmandu enjoys clear sky conditions during winter that makes passive solar design a potential strategy to achieve thermal comfort and eliminate kerosene heaters with their harmful effects. The abundance of rainfall during monsoon season makes rainwater collection a viable supplement to the unreliable municipal water supply.    This dissertation creates three new housing prototypes that address all these issues. These prototypes are modern interpretations of the vernacular  Chowk and Bahal, which create communal open space by grouping rowhouses around a common courtyard. Combining vernacular wisdom with the principles of sustainable design, these prototypes reduce land consumption; reduce resource consumption; create community open space; minimize imported materials; increase energy efficiency and thermal comfort; make homes and neighborhoods self sustainable for water supply and wastewater treatment; and altogether improve the quality of life.    This dissertation quantifies the embodied energy of basic building materials that are used in Nepal; proposes new types of locally-produced insulation; and develops a sustainable design evaluation system based on LEED. This integrated system of sustainable materials database, evaluation system, and vernacular-based housing prototypes developed in this dissertation lays out an example for other third world countries.

T1  - The effects of temperature and nutrient level on energy metabolism in two sympatric crayfish species
AN  - 250829362
AB  - Procambarus clarkii and Procambarus zonangulus are crayfish species with extensive ranges in the temperate climates of North America. Although similar morphologically and often found in close association in regions where their ranges overlap, they are not usually found in equal abundance. It has been proposed that physiological differences between the species may explain these differences in abundance within their common range. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of temperature and nutrient availability on metabolism and energy expenditure. Metabolic enzyme activities were similar in both species. Both species showed temperature dependent oxygen consumption rates. P. clarkii showed a greater tolerance to high temperature extremes than P. zonangulus, surviving exposure to 35°C regardless of prior temperature acclimation. Temperature also effected the binding affinity of the respiratory pigment, hemocyanin, and partially purified hemocyanins from both species acclimated to 30°C revealed the presence of a unique protein band not present in 10°C exposed crayfish of either species. During nutrient deprivation, enzyme activities responded more rapidly (within 2 months) to starvation than oxygen consumption. P. clarkii mobilized more dry material from the tail, hepatopancreas, and carcass than P. zonangulus during 5 months of starvation. Protein from the carcass was the major component mobilized in both species. The lack of significant conservation of nutrient stores in P. clarkii supports the hypothesis of Noblitt that  P. clarkii is adapted to climates where nutrient flow is continuous and the environment is seasonally stable. The slower mobilization of energy stores in P. zonangulus may provide an advantage under conditions where nutrient flow is pulsed, energy input is low, and conditions are unstable from year to year.

T1  - The Impact of Intensive Genetic Selection for Improved Performance in the Broiler Chicken on Metabolic Rate, Morphology and Body Composition
AN  - 2170575447
AB  - The intensive genetic selection for fast growth rate, improved feed conversion ratio and increased breast meat yield that broilers have undergone has resulted in an increased incidence of metabolic disorders. It has been hypothesised that this is due to an imbalance in form and function between supply and demand tissues, known as symmorphosis. Such a breakdown in symmorphosis may also have consequences in limiting future performance. The effects of genetic selection on the gross morphology (organ mass), metabolic rates and carcass composition of three genotypes of chicken, which have undergone selection on different criteria, were examined. In addition, the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was investigated as an alternative technique for assessing the chemical composition of chicken carcasses. The experimental studies described within this thesis investigated the effects of the intensive genetic selection in the modem broiler by comparing it with two other genotypes of chicken that have undergone different levels of selection. These included: a modem commercial broiler (Ross 308, FB), a broiler that has not been selected for fast growth since 1972 (Ross 1972, SB) and a layer chicken which has never been selected for fast growth rate (Euribrid HISEX, L). A thermal load was placed on the birds to evaluate the effects of genetic selection on metabolic rate. Metabolic rate was determined using open-circuit indirect calorimetry to measure oxygen consumption (VO2). Resting (RMR) and peak metabolic rate (PMR) were measured in each individual bird on the same day during the first 2 weeks of life. Resting metabolic rate was determined by measuring VO, of the birds at thermoneutrality (28-32 °C), whilst PMR was determined at the point that VO2 began to decline with decreasing temperature (0 to -7 °C). There was no significant effect of genotype on relative RMR (ml.O2/hr). However, the FB genotype had larger PMR and consequently a larger metabolic scope compared to the L genotype. This could be attributed to the greater relative muscle mass of the broiler, which is used primarily for heat production during shivering themiogenesis. The FB genotype also had a larger relative pectoral and leg muscle mass, but also a larger water content within these muscles, indicating a lack of maturity in the muscle growth. The FB genotype had larger relative intestine and caeca mass, whereas the relative gizzard and brain masses and ash content were greater in the L genotype. Relative liver mass did not vary with genotype and the variation in relative heart mass between genotypes depended on the covariate used in the analysis. This suggests that during the genetic selection process that the broiler chicken has undergone, the mass of these organs has been sacrificed to increase meat yield. The residuals of RMR correlated significantly and positively with the residuals of heart mass in those FB birds above 80 g. The broiler industry is continually trying to keep energy costs down, therefore they are likely to select birds with lower energy costs and therefore lower RMR. In turn this may potentially be selecting for modem broilers with a lower heart mass. The morphological differences observed in the first 14 days of life were further investigated. Each of the three genotypes was grown until their respective maximum growth rate was achieved, and then their organ development compared. As expected, the FB genotype had a larger body mass and grew at a faster rate than the L genotype, with the SB genotype being intemiediate. The relative pectoral and leg muscle masses were greater in the FB genotype and there was a larger water content within the muscles of the FB, which has been previously shown to indicate a lack of maturity in the muscle. The relative intestine, liver, heart and lung masses were all larger in the FB genotype compared to the other genotypes. The intestine and liver are required to absorb and metabolise nutrients and the heart and lungs are required to pump oxygenated and nutrient rich blood around the body. It is not surprising that these supply organs are larger in the FB genotype in response to the increased growth rate and breast meat yield. In contrast, the relative carcass, gizzard and brain masses were larger in the L genotype and the relative caeca mass was greater in the SB genotype compared to the FB. This suggests that the mass of these organs has been sacrificed during the selection process that the FB has undergone, with the possible consequence of metabolic disorders. A large detailed database of body composition in these three genotypes was generated. NIRS was used as an alternative technique for predicting the chemical composition of poultry carcasses. The use of NIRS provided a rapid, reliable and nonhazardous method of determining genotype, age, body mass, growth rate, and robustly predicted both crude protein and fat content of whole milled chicken carcasses. In addition, NIRS was also able to successfully discriminate between the different genotypes used within this study and also between birds from the same genotype (L) that had been fed diets with different energy and protein levels. It was concluded that the intensive genetic selection that has occurred within the broiler breeder industry to produce the modem broiler has led to a bird with an increased muscle mass but has also led to a reduction in relative mass of the brain, gizzard and carcass.

T1  - Resource Allocation During Avian Incubation
AN  - 2166846151
AB  - The ways in which birds allocate resources during the incubation phase of reproduction were investigated using empirical data gathered from populations of starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) breeding in Shetland and Spain, and modeling. The consequences of the allocations made to incubation for the resources allocated to other phases of life are discussed. Experimentally reducing the energetic demand of incubation by reducing the rate of heat loss from within a nest increased the proportion of offspring that fledged during the same breeding attempt, and the proportion of clutches that hatched completely during the subsequent attempt. Thus the energetic demand of incubation was shown to be sufficient to limit parental fitness, and was suggested to influence the way in which parents allocated resources to other reproductive phases, both within and between breeding attempts. Starlings nesting in poorly insulated cavities built larger nests and reduced the rate of heat loss from within the cavity to a greater extent than starlings nesting in well-insulated cavities. However, the rate of heat loss from within a completed nest was still related to the insulative quality of the original cavity. As experimentally reducing heat loss rate increased breeding success, the acquisition of a well insulated nest site was suggested to be an important phase of a starling's breeding attempt. Experimentally reducing the rate of heat loss from a nest also increased mean incubation-bout duration and thus the proportion of the day that female starlings spent incubating. This change is consistent with the hypothesis that parents terminate incubation bouts in response to their own condition rather than to egg temperature. The contradictory results of previous studies may be explained if, given energetic limitation during incubation, parents leave the nest when the costs of doing so are minimised. As a consequence of the time that incubating females allocated to activities away from the nest, eggs experienced mean temperatures that were below the predicted optimum for embryonic development. However, female nest attentiveness and mean egg temperature increased as the incubation period progressed, a change that may have been due to increased allocation to incubation rather than to changes in the demands of incubation or to improved foraging conditions. Experimentally enlarging a clutch for the duration of the incubation period reduced the proportion of the original clutch that hatched, and the proportion of offspring that fledged successfully. This is likely to have been because the addition of extra eggs directly affected the physical conditions experienced by the embryos, and affected a parent's ability to incubate the entire clutch equally. Clutch enlargement may also energetically constrain a parent's incubation ability. However, modeling suggested that the energetic debt accrued by an incubating parent does not necessarily increase with increasing clutch size, with the exact relationship depending on mean incubation temperature and the thermal properties of the clutch. Thus the consequences of incubation demands for optimal clutch size in birds are not necessarily clear. Male assistance with incubation was suggested to increase the proportion of offspring that hatched and fledged successfully and reduce the time that females spent incubating, and therefore to increase female fitness. However, male assistance was associated with monogamy. As male fitness may generally be maximised by polygyny, sexual conflict over male incubation was predicted. Males were suggested to incubate when they were unlikely to attract multiple females. However, primary females may liave increased the chance that a male would incubate by destroying secondary females' clutches. In conclusion, incubating a clutch of eggs can require substantial allocations of parental time and energy, affecting the resources available for and required by other life phases. Thus incubation can be costly, although costs may be state-dependent, and act through parents and/or their current offspring. Incubation demands may therefore be sufficient to influence overall resource allocation patterns and life-history strategies in birds.

T1  - Influence of season and temperature on the metabolic costs of survival in the intertidal isopod, Ligia oceanica (BL)
AN  - 900242072
AB  - The intertidal isopod, Ligia oceanica, inhabits humid micro-habitats at the high water mark of rocky shores, where it experiences elevated temperatures in the summer due to solar radiation. Temperature tolerances vary seasonally with critical maximum temperatures falling from 37.4 Â°C in the summer, to 34.9 Â°C in the winter.In general, whole-animal rates of oxygen uptake and protein synthesis of oxygen uptake were more sensitive to temperature change than rates of protein synthesis, due to a compensatory increase in RNA levels in the winter. Patterns of heat-shock protein induction varied between seasons, with acclimatised Ligia in the summer showing higher constitutive and de novo heat-shock protein synthesis levels than winter Ligia. In the summer, animals synthesised heat-shock protein 60 at two induction temperatures of 27Â°C and 31Â°C. Animals collected in the winter, however, synthesised hsp 60 at the lower induction temperature of 25Â°C, and continued to express hsp 60 at 27 and 29Â°C. Acclimated Ligia showed delayed heat-shock protein induction and an overall attenuated heat-shock response relative to acclimatised animals, regardless of season.Estimates of the metabolic costs of general protein synthesis revealed that in the winter, costs were relatively expensive and accounted for 69.97% of oxygen uptake rates at 40.86 <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/mu.gif">mol O2.mg protein-1. In the summer, metabolic costs were 4.6-times lower at 3.92 <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/mu.gif">mol O2.mg protein-1, accounting for 17.33% of oxygen uptake. Temperature acclimation had no effect on metabolic costs, but winter values, expressed as the proportion of oxygen uptake, showed remarkable similarity to those found in an Antarctic isopod. Metabolic costs of heat shock protein synthesis were 2.4-times higher in the winter than in the summer, showing that energy requirements for survival are higher at a time when energy stores may be restricted.

T1  - Simplified methodology for indoor environment design
AN  - 304655652
AB  - Current design of the building indoor environment uses averaged single parameters such as air velocity, air temperature or contaminant concentration. This approach gives only general information about thermal comfort and indoor air quality, which is limiting for the design of energy efficient and healthy buildings. The design of these buildings requires sophisticated but practical tools that are not currently available, and the objective of this thesis is to develop such a tool.    The development of the simple design tool had several phases. Each phase employed simplified models validated with measured data in order to assess model accuracy and reliability. The validation data was obtained from a state-of-the-art experimental facility at MIT.    Based on the collected data, we first developed simplified boundary conditions for the diffuser jet flow, which is the key flow element in mechanically ventilated spaces. The boundary conditions employ resultant momentum from the supply diffusers without modeling the detailed diffuser geometry. Although simple, the models can simulate airflow from complex diffusers commonly used for air-conditioning with reasonable accuracy.    Another simplification is the use of a zero-equation turbulence model to calculate indoor air distribution. The model uses the concept of eddy-viscosity and approximate turbulent viscosity with an algebraic equation. To test the turbulence model, an airflow program was developed. The program can simulate indoor airflow on a PC within several minutes, which is five to ten times faster than with the similar programs with a “standard” k-ϵ model.    Finally, the airflow program was coupled with an energy analysis program. The combined program simultaneously analyzes internal heat transfer and air movement as well as the heat transfer through the building envelope. The impacts on the thermal comfort in the occupied zone are quantified, and we found that the thermal comfort in most cases is not uniform. This has to be considered in designing radiative, convective, and hybrid heating and cooling systems for a building. The coupled program is an effective and economical design tool.

T1  - Effect of environmental temperature on troponin C variation in fish
AN  - 304644632
AB  - Ca++ sensitivity of homeotherm cardiac myofibrils is profoundly sensitive to temperature. Organisms living at low or variable temperatures must either avoid or compensate for the effects of temperature on myofibrillar function. Factors which influence myofibrillar Ca++ sensitivity (e.g. temperature, pH) have effects that are specific to troponin C (TnC) isoform. TnC structural differences between species or acclimation states may therefore contribute to thermal tolerance in both evolutionary and physiological adaptation.    I examined the role of TnC variation by comparing amino acid sequences obtained from a number of fish species with different evolutionary positions, thermal preferences and activity levels. TnC was amplified from cardiac mRNA using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction with primers from the highly conserved N- and C-termini regions of the protein. Sequences from yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares, yellow perch Perca flavescens, goldfish Carassius auratus and white sucker Catostomus commersoni were compared to published sequences from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and lamprey  Entosphenus japonicus.

T1  - Dauer formation at high temperatures in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>
AN  - 304637750
AB  - In response to unfavorable environmental conditions, the nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans arrests development and forms a dauer larva. Dauer formation is regulated by several environmental stimuli, including a pheromone and temperature. Dauer formation is moderately induced as the temperature increases from 15° to 25°. I show that dauer formation is strongly induced at 27° in wild-type animals and mutants such as unc-64, unc-31, unc-3, and egl-4 which do not form dauers at 25°. A 27° temperature stimulus is sufficient to induce dauer formation independent of pheromone. Analysis of previously described dauer mutants at 27° reveals several surprising results. Several classes of mutants ( dyf, daf-3, tax-4 and tax-2) that are defective in dauer formation at lower temperatures reverse their phenotypes at 27° and form dauers constitutively. Epistasis experiments place unc-64  and unc-31 at a different position in the dauer pathway from unc-3 and egl-4. I also uncover new branches of the dauer pathway at 27° that are not detected at 25° and show that epistatic gene interactions show both quantitative and qualitative differences depending on environmental conditions.    To isolate new genes that regulate dauer formation, I screened for mutants that form dauers constitutively at 27°. I found at least five genes that had not been isolated in screens at 25°. pdk-1 and  akt-1 encode protein kinases that appear to act as downstream components of an insulin signal transduction pathway. hid-1 encodes a novel transmembrane protein that may also act in this pathway.    To determine why dauer formation is strongly induced at 27°, I examined growth at high temperatures. I found that all available natural isolates of  C. elegans cannot reproduce at 28° and that dauer formation can protect against sterility. While there was no variation in the thermal limit among different isolates of the species, there was a lot of variation in pheromone response. There also was no variation in thermal limit among different isolates of the species C. briggsae, but the thermal limit was several degrees higher than that of C. elegans. I speculate that temperature may be a key factor distinguishing the ecological niches of these closely related species.

T1  - Exploration of spatiotemporal patterns in recruitment and community organization of Lake Erie fishes: A multiscale, mechanistic approach
AN  - 304630750
AB  - To explore factors that influence fish community organization and recruitment in Lake Erie, I used three approaches. First, I collaborated on an ecosystem modeling project that explored how anthropogenic disturbance might cause the Lake Erie ecosystem to take on several configurations (e.g., pristine, degraded) (Chapter 2). Analysis of differences among these configurations suggest that both protecting natural land from development and limiting phosphorus inputs are critical to maintaining healthy fish communities. Second, by merging bottom trawl data from western and central Lake Erie with species-specific life-history information (e.g., tolerances to environmental degradation), I demonstrate that reduced phosphorus inputs (i.e., oligotrophication) have driven fish community rehabilitation during 1969–1996, whereby intolerant species have begun to replace tolerant species (Chapter 3). In turn, species turnover has caused species richness to decline in the west basin, but increase in the central basin. Given that several recovering intolerant species are desired sport or commercial fishes, these analyses support some of the hypotheses generated from the ecosystem model. Third, using multiple regression modeling, I explored ecological mechanisms underlying yellow perch growth and recruitment in western and central Lake Erie during 1969–1998 (Chapter 4). During this time, recruitment appears to have switched from dependence on temperature to dependence on factors that influence system productivity (e.g., precipitation, river discharge, phosphorus loading), likely owing to oligotrophication. Although productivity was unrelated to growth, interspecific competition with white perch (Morone americana) appears to have negatively influenced yellow perch growth. Conversely, warm temperatures appear to enhance growth by stimulating early spawning or by increasing zooplankton availability to fish. Finally, I combined recent (1994–1998) larval yellow perch growth, diet, and hatch date data with temperature, zooplankton, and potential competitor (e.g., white perch) abundance information to test the relative importance of temperature and interspecific competition to yellow perch growth (Chapter 5). Temperature, through both hypothesized pathways, does indeed regulate larval growth, whereas interspecific competition with white perch appears unimportant. Ultimately, this work exemplifies how multi-scale, mechanistic investigations of fish population and community dynamics can enhance the ability of resource managers to understand and anticipate changes in their fisheries.

T1  - Decreasing the fission track analysis detection limit of plutonium concentrations in human excreta by utilizing two distinct neutron energy spectra
AN  - 304630702
AB  - Environmental Pu239 arises from the development, production and testing of nuclear weapons. Fallout of this weapon debris has produced an average worldwide Pu239 level of about 1 ppb. Traditional methods are available to measure Pu239 at fCi levels, but these methods are unable to detect Pu239 at environmental levels (100 aCi). Such an ultra sensitive method chemically separates Pu239  from naturally occurring uranium and other fissile isotopes. Then the technique is applied to the Pu239 burden effluent.    Fissile samples are exposed to distinct neutron spectra to achieve quantitative analysis of each fissile isotope using fission track analysis without chemical separation. The University of Utah's 100 kW TRIGA reactor was used to deliver thermal and epithermal neutron fluences. Each isotope has a unique fission cross-section for different neutron energy ranges. It was possible to differentiate between the isotopes based on the number of fission tracks produced. The proposed technique can measure the amount of Th232, U235, and Pu239 in the sample simultaneously. Samples containing known amounts of Pu239, natural uranium (U235 and U238) were deposited on the polycarbonate Lexan detectors and irradiated in different positions in the reactor core. They were chemically etched and fission tracks were counted. The concentrations were calculated using the computer code COG and the mathematical correlations for the two irradiators.[special characters omitted]   T1 and T2 are the number of tracks counted from samples when exposed to a known neutron spectra. Without chemical processing, the detection limit of ∼120 aCi/g can easily be achieved. Calculated amounts ranged within a factor of two to three from a known quantity deposited on the Lexan detectors. The uncertainties associated with this method stem from the differences in theoretical and actual neutron flux in the irradiators, the inefficiencies with etching process, and errors with the track counting activity.

T1  - Effects of abiotic and biotic stress on the energy budgets of <i>Arbacia punctulata</i> and <i>Lytechinus variegatus</i> (Echinodermata: Echinoidea)
AN  - 304618600
AB  - As arbaciid and toxopneustid sea urchins have different morphological, biological and ecological characteristics, they can be predicted to have different life-history strategies. It was hypothesised that Arbacia punctulata  would have a stress tolerant life-history strategy whereas  Lytechinus variegatus would have a competitive strategy. This prediction was tested by placing A. punctulata and L. variegatus  under selected biotic and abiotic stress. Components of the energy budget of fed and starved individuals at two different temperatures were measured in three different seasons.    Although Lytechinus variegatus had a significantly higher feeding rate than Arbacia punctulata, the amount of energy absorbed did not differ as A. punctulata had higher absorption efficiencies. Arbacia punctulata had a significantly higher excretion rate indicating higher rates of protein turnover, indicating more energy was being allocated to maintenance. When fed, L. variegatus  increased its relative energy allocation to the gonads. This is as predicted for a competitive species which, when conditions are favourable, should allocate energy to reproduction (once sexually mature) over growth and maintenance. If A. punctulata is a stress tolerant species it should allocate relatively more energy to maintenance and less to growth and reproduction. In these experiments production of fed A. punctulata  did not increase despite absorbing as much energy as L. variegatus. As respiration rates and the amount of energy absorbed did not differ, this energy must have been allocated to maintenance rather than growth. No difference in total energy changes of starved individuals for A. punctulata and L. variegatus was observed suggesting that under nutritional stress, either A. punctulata  requires a longer time to acclimate, or that stress tolerance does not extend to this biotic factor.    Food had a much larger impact on energy budgets than temperature. This may have been because the temperature differential was not large enough to cause a significant effect. Temperature had a greater range of significant effects on Arbacia punctulata compared to  Lytechinus variegatus. This may have been because of the variation in reproductive condition at the start of each experiment. The initial starting reproductive condition of the sea urchins had a major impact on their ability to change energy allocation. When reproductively very mature, A. punctulata  was unable to reduce energy costs and so suffered large decreases in production when stressed despite its supposedly stress tolerant life-history strategy.

T1  - Physiological adaptations of ectotherms to cold: Seasonal and geographic trends
AN  - 304608867
AB  - The first study provided a seasonal characterization of metabolic rate and the potential for morphological development in overwintering third-instar larvae of the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis. Metabolic rate (CO2 production) was significantly lower between October 15 and February 9 than in autumn (September 9) and spring (March 1). The induction of diapause was temporally correlated with the development of cold-hardening, maximum larval mass, and gall senescence, but my experiments did not identify the specific cues triggering diapause induction. Until December 15 the larvae were incapable of morphological development, even at permissive temperatures. Remarkably, diapause development occurred in larvae frozen at −20°C.    The next study examined the hypothesis that cold and freezing reduce metabolic rates and water loss of goldenrod gall fly larvae. Metabolic rate fell consistently as the larvae were cooled below freezing but remained measurable even at −15°C. Frozen larvae had a significantly reduced metabolic rate and rate of water loss compared to supercooled larvae at the same temperature. Thus, freezing may be advantageous by reducing energy consumption and water loss.    I also examined whether mild winter temperatures are detrimental to the survival and reproductive potential of goldenrod gall flies. Larvae held at 12°C suffered high mortality (70%) and relatively low potential fecundity as adults (mean ± SEM = 199 ± 11 eggs/female), while those held at 0°C had both low mortality (11%) and high potential fecundity (256 ± 15 eggs/female). I conclude that mild winter temperatures may be detrimental to some overwintering insects, particularly species that do not feed following winter diapause.    The final study compared the degree of freeze tolerance between gray treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis and H. versicolor) from three different geographic locations (Indiana, Minnesota, and Missouri). There were no differences in cryoprotective responses (glycerol and glucose) nor in the minimum temperature survived. The Minnesota frogs had more liver glycogen available but did not produce more cryoprotectant. I conclude that (1) there are no genetic differences to enhance freeze tolerance in northern frogs and (2) comparisons of previously published studies have led to incorrect conclusions regarding adaptations to freeze tolerance in this group.

T1  - Studies of hydrogen peroxide for the treatment of bacterial gill disease in fish
AN  - 304594403
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide and its primary decomposition products, oxygen and water, are considered environmentally compatible. The apparent lack of adverse environmental impacts of hydrogen peroxide combined with its effectiveness as an antimicrobial agent makes this compound an excellent candidate for further evaluation in aquaculture. Hydrogen peroxide is currently being evaluated for its potential as a therapeutic compound for a variety of external disease organisms of fish. Research in our laboratory focused on delineating effective hydrogen peroxide dosing regimes for treating bacterial gill disease in rainbow trout and walleye. The primary goals of these studies were to document the effects of hydrogen peroxide on the pathology, blood chemistry parameters, and indices of antioxidiant defense status of the target species.    The toxicity of hydrogen peroxide to fish seems to be dependent on factors such as species, age, dose water temperature and extent of exposure. Walleyes were more sensitive than rainbow trout to treatments with hydrogen peroxide. Older fish were more susceptible to exposure to hydrogen peroxide than younger fish. Acute toxicity was evident from histopathologic inspection of gills (e.g. extensive epithelial lifting, necrosis) of fish treated with high doses of hydrogen peroxide. A digitalized scoring method was developed to quantify the severity of the gill lesions. The index was a good indicator of the toxicity of hydrogen peroxide as well as of the degree of recovery of the gill epithelium of treated fish.    The value of hydrogen peroxide as a therapeutic compound for use in walleye culture has been questioned due to the high sensitivity of walleyes to this compound at suggested treatment levels. Studies indicated that exposure of walleye to low levels of hydrogen peroxide resulted in increased tolerance to subsequent exposure. One possible mechanism involved in the modification of tolerance of fish to treatment with hydrogen peroxide (e.g. induction of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) was investigated. This phenomenon of increased tolerance may be of value in the development of management strategies that will permit the use of hydrogen peroxide with walleyes and other sensitive species.

T1  - On the physiology of hydrogen diving and its implication for hydrogen biochemical decompression
AN  - 304589524
AB  - Biochemical decompression, a novel approach for decreasing decompression sickness (DCS) risk by increasing the tissue washout rate of the inert gas, was tested in pigs during simulated H2 dives. Since there is only limited physiological data on the use of H2 as a diving gas, direct calorimetry and respirometry were used to determine whether physiological responses to hyperbaric H2 and He are different in guinea pigs The data suggested that responses in hyperbaric heliox and hydrox cannot be explained solely by the thermal properties of the two gas mixtures. To increase the washout rate of H2, a H2-metabolizing microbe (Methanobrevibacter smithii) was tested that converts H2 to H2O and CH4. Using pigs (Sus scrofa) comparisons were made between untreated controls, saline-injected controls, and animals injected with M. smithii into the large intestine. To simulate a H2 dive, pigs were placed in a dry hyperbaric chamber and compressed to different pressures (22.3–25.7 atm) for times of 30–1440 min. Subsequently, pigs were decompressed to 11 atm at varying rates (0.45–1.80 atm • min−1), and observed for severe symptoms of DCS for 1 h. Chamber gases (O2, N2 , He, H2, CH4) were monitored using gas chromatography throughout the dive. Release of CH4 in untreated pigs indicated that H2 was being metabolized by native intestinal microbes and results indicated that native H2-metabolizing microbes may provide some protection against DCS following hyperbaric H2 exposure.  M. smithii injection further enhanced CH4 output and lowered DCS incidence. A probabilistic model estimated the effect of H2-metabolism on the probability of DCS, P(DCS), after hyperbaric H2 exposure. The data set included varying compression and decompression sequences for controls and animals with intestinal injections of H2 metabolizing microbes. The model showed that increasing total activity of M. smithii  injected into the animals reduced P(DCS). Reducing the tissue concentration of the inert gas significantly reduced the risk of DCS in pigs, further supporting the hypothesis that DCS is primarily caused by elevated tissue inert gas tension. The data provide promising support for the development of biochemical decompression as an aid to human diving.

T1  - Adaptive variation in the physiology of a widely distributed mammal and re-examination of the bases for its desert survival
AN  - 304581122
AB  - Terrestrial environments, and particularly deserts, arguably impose the greatest challenges to life with respect to extremes in temperature and potential for dehydration. Small rodents are the dominant mammals within many deserts and, because physiological adaptations are prominent in environmental extremes, these animals represent excellent models for studying the physiology of terrestrial mammals. Geographic variation in physiological parameters related to desiccation has been largely ignored in mammals, yet is important to understand limits on distribution and the evolutionary origin of adaptations.    Accordingly, this research focused on the water economy, thermal biology, and intraspecific variation in physiology in one widely distributed subspecies of nocturnal desert rodent, Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami merriami). The complex association between these animals and their environments that permits them to reside in the Sonoran Desert, as well as the covariation of physiology and geography, was examined by focusing studies on animals from xeric, intermediate, and mesic sites within this subspecies' distribution. Data show that animals from the xeric site not only are smaller, but have much lower rates of evaporative water loss than those from the intermediate and mesic sites. In fact, kangaroo rats from the intermediate and mesic sites, respectively, exhibited 33% and 64% greater average rates of evaporation than those from the xeric site. Microclimate data show that the xeric site is >5°C hotter than the mesic site throughout the year, both above the surface and to depths of 2 m in the soil, and, presumably, is a driving force behind the intraspecific variation in physiology.    The roles acclimation and developmental plasticity may have in the intraspecific variation in resistance to desiccation in D. m. merriami were investigated. This variation in water loss arises primarily from genetic/maternal effects specific to lineages from areas of contrasting temperature and humidity. However, the effects of the two labile modes (acclimation and developmental plasticity) can equal apparent genetic differences in desiccation resistance among these lineages.    Because there are contradictions in the data surrounding the physiology and ecology of these archetypical organisms, traditional views were re-evaluated with field and laboratory analyses. Thermal and hydric environments were quantified and the physiological and behavioral effects of heat and aridity were examined in intraspecific comparisons. Data demonstrate that most water loss is through the skin, not ventilatory (as has been asserted), and that the latter contributes to total evaporation, at most, only 44%. Also, these animals are much more thermally tolerant than appreciated and remain active for ≥30 min at an ambient temperature (Ta) of 40°C and for 18 min at Ta  = 42.5°C.    Finally, although nocturnally active above the surface and diurnally fossorial, these animals are much more tolerant of high temperatures and exposed to substantially greater potential desiccation and thermal stress than believed. In fact, they remain in shallow (<1m) burrows at high Ta's (>35°C) throughout summer days. Stomach content and nitrogen isotope analyses show that (rather than being strictly granivorous, as is accepted) they are omnivorous and facultatively consume significant amounts of leafy vegetation and insects to maintain water balance during harsh desert summers. This importantly changes our perception of their ability to survive in desert environments.

T1  - The biology and ecology of the sabellid Bispira volutacornis (Montagu) (Polychaeta: Sabellidae), with particular reference to feeding, reproduction development, and its associated copepod Gastrodelphys clausii (Graeffe) (Copepoda: Gastrodelphyidae) in Lettercallow Bay.
AN  - 301590811
AB  - Bispira volutacornis (Montagu) occurs in large aggregations in Lettercallow Bay (53o 17.5'N, 9o 42'W) on the west coast of Ireland.  This tubiculous sabellid is a filter feeder that creates a collecting current, through the co-ordinated action of various rows of cilia.  The rheophilic B. volutacornis seems to favour currents in the c. 1-3 cm.s-1 range with an apparent tolerance threshold of c. 8.75 cm.s-1.  Sorting of food, on a size basis, takes place on the basal folds and lateral lips.  Histological sections of the gut showed benthic diatoms to be the chief food. B. volutacornis constructs a two-layered tube, with an inner gelatinous lining, and an outer sedimentary layer.  Irrigation of the tube is apparent both during the variable withdrawal periods and while feeding.  The tubes and experimental transites in Lettercallow Bay were seen to be randomly colonised by epizoids.Bispira volutacornis is a gonochoristic and polytelic species.  Germinal epithelium was the observed site of oogonial/spermatologonial proliferation.  A twelve-month interval is seen between the initiation of successive proliferation events.  Spawning, as such, was restricted to the late-July to September period.  The proliferation of gametes, the onset of vitellogenesis and the spawning event all appear to coincide with either the raising or lowering of the temperature, B. volutacornis has an ect aquasperm and an oocyte encased in a vitelline envelope.  A spiral, holoblastic cleavage pattern is characteristic of development. An undetermined blastula followed by gastrulation results in a trochophore larva with a prototroch, apical tuft and a prominent eyespot.

T1  - Skeletal muscle characteristics of commercial and traditional strains of turkey
AN  - 2038413532
AB  - Accompanying improvements in the performance of commercial turkeys has been an increase in reports of muscle abnormalities. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of selection on skeletal muscle growth and damage. The commercial strain attained body weights over three times heavier than traditional birds (19.22±5.12 kg v. 5.54+2.24 kg) and breast muscle weights over five times greater (3.04±0.84 kg v. 0.56±0.30 kg) in 25 weeks. Muscle damage was significantly greater in commercial turkeys (mean plasma CK 22817+11525 IU/L v. 703±534 IU/L in the traditional strain at 25 weeks). Quantification of histopathology indicated a greater incidence of myopathy in the commercial strain. Commercial birds were subjected to food restriction (60-70% of ad lib. intakes) and in the fully restricted (5-20 weeks) and compensatory (5-10 weeks) treatment body weight was 40% and 10% lower, fibre diameter was 18%> and 7% less, and CK was 78% and 23% lower at 20 weeks compared to birds fed ad libitum. Regression of CK on body weight and fibre diameter fit the same exponential curve for all three treatments (inflection point corresponded to 8-10 kg body weight and 60-75 μm fibre diameter). These results suggested that muscle damage was related to body weight and fibre size irrespective of growth rate. Halothane anaesthesia did not induce muscle damage in commercial turkeys, which did not support the hypothesis that a defect of the ryanodine receptor underlies the development of muscle damage. Comparative studies of the effects of acute heat stress in commercial and traditional turkeys indicated that commercial birds had a lower thermal tolerance, possibly due to the different conformation of the two strains at similar body weights, which may reduce the effectiveness of evaporative heat loss in the commercial birds. Overall conclusions from these studies suggested that commercial selection has increased in breast meat yield and muscle fibre sizes. The improvements in body weight, muscle mass, and fibre size combined with inadequate development of other systems may underlie the myopathy observed in commercial turkeys. These data have implications for turkey breeding programs in terms of welfare, production, and meat quality .

T1  - The environmental physiology of the nonindigenous marine mussel, Perna perna (Linnaeus 1758), in the western Gulf of Mexico
AN  - 304584871
AB  - The subtropical, marine, intertidal mussel, Perna perna (Bivalvia: Mytilacea), invaded Gulf of Mexico shores in 1990 and now ranges from Veracruz, Mexico, to Freeport, Texas. Its resistance and capacity adaptations were determined to assess its eventual North American distribution. Its broad-scale North American distribution will be limited by its incipient thermal limits of 7.5°–30°C. These limits, reflected by respiratory suppression at 10°C and 30°C, suggest that it could colonize Atlantic shores north to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and Pacific shores from Baja to northern California. Within this range, its salinity, hypoxia, desiccation and freezing tolerances will determine microgeographic colonization success. P. perna had little capacity for short-term or long-term (i.e., acclimation) temperature regulation of respiration over 10°–30°C reflecting its 7.5°–30°C tolerated temperature range. Its moderate regulation of oxygen consumption rate with progressive hypoxia and hypoxic tolerance (>Po2 of 15.9–47.7 Torr over 15°–25°C) were comparable to that of estuarine bivalves as was its salinity tolerance (i.e., 15–50 ppt), Thus, P. perna is restricted to marine, rocky shores primarily as a result of its inability to tolerate high estuarine water temperatures (>30°C). Restriction of P. perna  to subtropical habitats was reflected in poor tolerance of emersion at temperatures below –2.5°C. Hemolymph supercooling in freezing conditions indicated a lack of the ice nucleating agents characteristic of freeze-tolerant boreal mytilids. Its water loss rates and emersion tolerance times were highly correlated, median emersion tolerance being 118–246 h at 15°, 72–93 h at 25°C, and 25–27 h at 35°C depending on relative humidity. A low upper thermal limit and poor emersion tolerance restricts P. perna to low intertidal habitats were temperature and desiccation stresses are minimal. Poor thermal and emersion tolerances resulted in near extirpation of P. perna from the Gulf of Mexico when ambient summer water temperatures reached its 30°C upper limit during 1997 and 1998. Low upper thermal limits, poor desiccation resistance and sensitivity to freezing could be utilized for mitigation of P. perna raw water system macrofouling. Similar temperature, salinity, hypoxia, and desiccation responses among P. perna and  Mytilus species, support the evolution of pernids from a boreal mytilid ancestor.

T1  - Effects of temperature, salinity and food on the life histories of Balanus amphitrite amphitrite Darwin and Hydroides elegans (Haswell)
AN  - 304568674
AB  - The barnacle Balanus amphitrite amphitrite and the polychaete Hydroides elegans, both dominant species in Hong Kong's fouling communities, exhibit dramatically different seasonal recruitment patterns. Previous field studies have led to some speculations on the relationship between environmental factors and recruitment seasonalities of these two invertebrates. In this study, I present a quantitative assessment of the effects of temperature, salinity, and food on the maturation, fecundity, larval survival, larval growth, and settlement of B. a. amphitrite  and H. elegans. The results show that these two species, which are both r-selected species, differ dramatically in their responses to a similar set of manipulated environmental conditions. Although the adults of both species are quite resistant to short-term starvation, the larvae of  B. a. amphitrite are more sensitive to food-deprivation than those of H. elegans. High temperature promotes survival, growth and reproduction in both species, but the reproduction and larval development of B. a. amphitrite are more vulnerable to a decline in temperature than those of H. elegans. All stages of B. a. amphitrite  have a similarly high capacity of hypo-osmoregulation and this capacity was altered very little by large fluctuations in salinities [special characters omitted]15‰. The tolerance of H. elegans differs with developmental stage: adults and older juveniles survived well at [special characters omitted]20‰ whereas blastulae could survive only at [special characters omitted]30‰. These results indicate that the sensitivity of these two species to fluctuations of temperature, salinity and food could account for the dominance of H. elegans in the winter and spring and that of B. a. amphitrite in the summer.    In this study I have also examined the plasticity of some developmental traits and acclimation in B. a. amphitrite. The data shows that food concentration, temporary starvation, culture method or larval source do not affect the larval size or settlement ability of B. a. amphitrite  cyprid. However, hypo-osmotic stress experienced by one developmental stage has detrimental effects on the survival or development time of the next stage. These results should be taken into account in bioassays involving the use of barnacle larvae and in explaining the growth variability among different batches of juveniles.

T1  - Physical variability and fluctuating asymmetry in Rivulus marmoratus: Geographic differences and developmental stability in homozygous and heterozygous populations
AN  - 304554061
AB  - Rivulus marmoratus (Pisces: Aplocheilidae) is a small cyprinodontid fish indigenous to mangroves of the western tropical Atlantic. This species is well known as the only self-fertilizing, hermaphroditic vertebrate animal, and populations normally consist of genetically diverse groups of homozygous clones. However, male fish are known from a few populations, and outcrossing has been documented from one area (Belize, C.A.), where fish are heterozygous. Rivulus marmoratus also exhibits a number of behaviors and environmental tolerances unusual in fishes, and since the species is secretive, rare in some habitats and difficult to collect, knowledge of its natural history has been limited until recently.    This study provides a general review of the biology and ecology of  R. marmoratus and then addresses three questions about wild populations: (1) Are there meristic and morphometric differences between widespread populations? (2) Are there differences in fluctuating asymmetry and physical variability between naturally occurring homozygous and heterozygous populations? (3) Is heterozygosity still found in Belize, and can it be found in other populations were males have recently been documented?    Thirty-two meristic and morphometric characters in 180 fish from 11 populations (ranging from Brazil to Florida) were examined with univariate and multivariate statistics for determination of overall differences among populations. In addition, fluctuating asymmetry (FA: left/right differences in bi-lateral characters within individual fish), presence of physical anomalies and variability of characters were compared between Belize (heterozygous) and eight other (homozygous) populations. To control for possible environmental effects, offspring of two populations (Belize and Florida) were reared at 25°C and similarly analyzed. Finally, offspring of wild fish from Belize, Honduras and Bahamas were reared and DNA fingerprinted (by others) to determine heterozygosity/homozygosity.    All characters with the exception of pectoral fin rays were significantly different among populations. In addition, Belizean male fish differed from hermaphrodites in several morphometric characters. Fish reared at constant temperature also displayed significant differences, indicating a probable genetic component to differences in wild fish. The multivariate analyses also confirmed considerable heterogeneity among R. marmoratus. Overall, fish from two Brazilian sites, the Florida Everglades, Belize and Honduras appear to be distinct from the other groups. The characters which contributed most to group delineations were precaudal vertebrae, distance from pelvic fin origin to anal fin origin, pectoral fin length and number of branched caudal rays. Discriminant function analysis was able to classify the fish reared at 25°C to individual clonal heritage, although with a different set of characters than in wild fish.    The FA analyses and variability comparisons revealed no differences between heterozygous and homozygous populations, and the same was true for fish reared at a constant temperature. However, some populations (e.g. Brazil) were more variable than others. These results may indicate that coadapted gene complexes are more important than heterozygosity in canalizing developmental stability in this animal.    The DNA fingerprinting revealed a new heterozygous population from the Bay Islands, Honduras, where even a very low (2%) proportion of males can apparently lead to outcrossing. However, a population from the Bahamas with a similarly low proportion of males (1%) was uniformly homozygous. The only other known heterozygous population (Belize) was shown to have remained heterozygous since it was last studied in 1991.

T1  - Hollow carbon tubes as a sampling trap for thermal desorption/tandem mass spectral analysis of organic analytes
AN  - 304544678
AB  - Technological developments have enabled for the detection of extremely low levels of organic compounds. As detection limits decrease, background levels of trace organics become apparent. This dissertation describes how carbon-coated hollow quartz tubes may be used for the sampling of trace organic compounds in air. An interface was designed to allow for analytes to be thermally desorbed from hollow carbon coated tubes and detected using a PE-Sciex API  IIIPlus triple stage mass spectrometer (MS/MS). In this research, picogram-level detection limits were possible. Air samples of clean room environments were analyzed using this technique to evaluate the efficacy of various air purification methods. Conventional methods for the sampling and analysis of trace organics in air generally utilize packed traps such as Tenax/silica gel. The traps are thermally desorbed onto a gas chromatographic column and detected using various GC detectors. This method requires a considerable amount of time for the compounds to elute from the column. The method that will be discussed had analysis times of less than one minute for phenyl-amine compounds, and was specific for gas-phase analytes. Analytes were not chromatographically resolved; rather they were resolved within the quadrupoles of the instrument based on their mass and characteristic product ion. The selectivity gained through the MS/MS technique allowed for accurate quantitation to the picogram level. The interface of the hollow carbon tubes to the MS/MS as well as experimental design will be discussed.

T1  - The effect of antifreeze proteins on the cold tolerance of goldfish (Carassium auratus L.)
AN  - 304539940
AB  - The antifreeze proteins (AFP) and glycoproteins (AFGP) of high latitude marine teleosts are an adaptation to extreme low temperature in the presence of ice. Through their affinity to ice crystals, antifreeze proteins are able to adsorb to the surface of ice crystals and prevent their growth. In this way, fish producing them are able to live at temperatures one or more degrees below their plasma freezing point without freezing.    Recent studies point to the possibility that antifreeze proteins may play a role in the nonfreezing cold adaptation of the fish producing them. To test the ability of antifreeze proteins to increase the cold tolerance of fish, warm-acclimated goldfish were injected with antifreeze proteins and exposed to various nonfreezing low temperatures. All three antifreeze types tested (Type I AFP from winter flounder, Type III AFP from ocean pout, and AFGP from Atlantic cod) increased the cold tolerance of goldfish as evidenced by the proportion of antifreeze-injected fish recovering from cold narcosis or cold coma. The AF(G)Ps did not increase the amount of time goldfish could remain exposed to a test temperature before the onset of cold coma, nor did they decrease the temperature at which narcosis occurred when temperature was lowered gradually. These results suggest that antifreeze proteins prevent or reduce cell damage arising from cold shock at rapidly reduced temperatures. The results of this study, along with those of previous studies, suggest a role for antifreeze proteins in nonfreezing cold tolerance and have implications for cold water aquaculture.

T1  - Biotic factors and temperature tolerances via critical thermal methodology in goldfish
AN  - 304535083
AB  - CTMinimum and CTMaximum were measured in 620 goldfish to determine if biotic factors, in particular starvation, condition factor and size, affect temperature tolerance.    Twenty-eight days of starvation adversely affected both upper and lower temperature tolerance. Condition factor was related to upper but not lower temperature tolerance.    Goldfish of three different sizes (25-50 mm, 50-100 mm and 100-150 mm) had similar lower and upper temperature tolerances.    Over a 5 to 35$\sp\circ$C range of acclimation temperatures, ultimate CTMinimum and CTMaximum were 0.3 and 43.6$\sp\circ$C with a dynamic temperature tolerance polygon of 1429$\sp\circ$C$\sp2$.

T1  - Development and application of a genetic algorithm-informational modeling approach to exploratory statistical modeling of lizard-habitat relationships
AN  - 304527565
AB  - Exploratory statistical modeling was conducted on associations between 18 habitat features and the occurrence of Anolis carolinensis, an arboreal lizard, in plots at its northern distributional limits in Tennessee. A genetic algorithm-informational modeling (GAIM) approach was developed to reduce certain limitations imposed by the commonly used stepwise algorithms and hypothesis-testing procedures and allow a wider exploration of multivariate data. The GAIM approach utilizes a genetic algorithm and an informational model-selection criterion to find a set of well-fitting models and a frequency distribution of variables in this set of models can help analysts find useful combinations of variables or factors.    Plots were surveyed for the presence of A. carolinensis in summer and winter and habitat variables were measured. Logistic regression modeling using GAIM methods was conducted separately on summer and winter data. Most frequent variables in the set of well-fitting summer models were: distance to overwintering rock, summer canopy categorization, distance to habitat edge, herb/shrub cover, summer sunlight index, ambient temperature, and standardized distance along the habitat edge from the habitat's western boundary.    Most frequent variables in the final set of winter models were: ambient temperature, presence of live overstory evergreen tree trunks, presence of overwintering rock, standardized distance along the habitat edge from the west boundary of habitat, distance to overwintering rock, and canopy cover categorization.    Summer models suggest that further research on A. carolinensis  focus on sunlight and thermal factors and habitat features related to spatial scales beyond the summer home range scale. Winter results suggest future research might examine responses of this species to shelter and potential basking sites, sunlight availability and temperature, and spatial features beyond the typical winter home range size. Methods using experimental control, or at least partial control, over field variables are needed to determine the specific responses of this species to key habitat features and the causal mechanisms underlying those responses. In addition, more studies are needed which take approaches based on biophysical and physiological ecology, especially if they can be linked to reproductive output, population ecology, and habitat use on local and regional scales.

T1  - Thermoregulatory and endocrine adaptations of small body size in primates
AN  - 304520291
AB  - Contrary to the widely held assumption that tropical regions are environmentally benign, there is a surprising degree of seasonality in food supply and ambient temperature (Ta) which can have a significant impact on energy use in small-bodied endotherms. The Callitrichid primates, pygmy and common marmoset, share many life history traits (e.g. twinning, gummivory) but differ in size (164 [special characters omitted] 10g and 334 [special characters omitted] 22g, respectively). Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and minimal thermal conductance (C), estimated via oxygen consumption, and serum thyroid hormone concentrations were obtained for male subjects housed under constant T a of 27°C. Core body temperature (Tb) was monitored continuously using implanted radiotransmitters. Subjects (n = 6 each) were exposed to 8 hours of natural nighttime temperatures (18°C) for six weeks to examine the extent of acclimation. Under constant Ta, the pygmy marmoset had a higher RMR compared to the larger marmoset (0.67 [special characters omitted] 0.02ml O2/(g*hr), and 0.50 [special characters omitted] .03ml O2/(g*hr), p < 0.001) higher C (0.065 [special characters omitted] 0.003ml O2/(g*hr*°C) and 0.042 [special characters omitted] 0.002ml O2/(g*hr*°C), p < 0.001) and higher lower critical temperature (29.0 [special characters omitted] 0.6°C and 26.4 [special characters omitted] 0.7°C, p < 0.02) Cold exposure resulted in an increase in pygmy marmoset RMR (0.97 [special characters omitted] 0.02ml O2/(g*hr), p < 0.02) with no effect observed in common marmosets (p > 0.05), nor was there an effect on C in either species (p > 0.05). Following cold treatment, inactive phase minimal Tb decreased in pygmy (34.9 [special characters omitted] 0.2°C to 33.9 [special characters omitted] .1°C, p < 0.0.05) and common marmosets (35.5 [special characters omitted] 0.08°C to 33.3 [special characters omitted] 0.4°C, p < 0.05). Pygmy marmosets increased energy assimilation (0.504 [special characters omitted] 0.055kJ/g to 0.800 [special characters omitted] 0.037kJ/g, p < 0.001) while common marmosets showed no significant change (0.629 [special characters omitted] 0.98kJ/g to 0.536 [special characters omitted] 0.031kJ/g, (p > 0.05). Pygmy marmosets devoted 60% of their assimilated energy to RMR, versus 40% in the larger species. Compared to pygmy marmosets, common marmosets had significantly higher total thyroxine (3.4 [special characters omitted] 0.3μg/dl and 8.7 [special characters omitted] 1.1μg/dl, respectively; p < 0.001) and free thyroxine (0.98 [special characters omitted] 0.1ng/dl and 4.2 [special characters omitted] 0.5ng/dl, p < 0.001) with no difference in free triiodothyronine (3.2 [special characters omitted] 0.2pg/ml and 4.0 [special characters omitted] 0.7pg/ml, (p > 0.05). There was no effect of cold treatment on thyroid hormones in either species. Taken together, the pygmy marmoset may represent a limit to further body size reductions in New World primates due to thermoregulatory, metabolic and ecological constraints imposed by small body size.

T1  - Aspects of the low-temperature biology of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis
AN  - 304517904
AB  - Although it has been known for over 20 years that some insects are able to acclimate to low temperature within minutes (i.e., rapidly cold harden), little is known about the physiological basis or the ecological relevance of this capacity. In the first two studies presented herein, I demonstrate that Drosophila melanogaster rapidly cold harden during ecologically relevant cooling and that the protection thus afforded benefits the organism at ecologically relevant temperatures. The first chapter demonstrates how decreasing cooling rate from 1.0°C min–1 to 0.05°C min–1 increased the capacity D. melanogaster  to survive exposure to subzero temperature. Furthermore, flies cooled at 0.1°C min–1 entered cold torpor at significantly lower temperature (2.6°C) than did flies cooled at 0.1°C min –1, indicating that rapid cold hardening benefited the organism at temperatures encountered in nature.    The second chapter, demonstrates that during the cooling phase of a single ecologically-based thermoperiod, the capacity of D. melanogaster to survive 1 h of exposure to –7°C increased significantly from 5 ± 5% to 62.5 ± 7.3%, while their CTmin significantly decreased by 1.9°C. Much of the cold hardiness accrued during the cooling phase of one thermoperiod was retained during warming and contributed to significantly higher levels of cold tolerance acquired during subsequent thermoperiods.    In the third chapter, I examined the resistance of diapausing (overwintering) and non-diapausing (summer) Sarcophaga crassipalpis (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) pupae to inoculative freezing. Diapausing pupae were significantly more resistant than non-diapausing. Exposing the thin pupal cuticle by removing the ends of the puparial case eliminated the capacity of both pupal types to resist inoculative freezing, indicating that resistance to inoculative freezing resides with the puparium. Relative to pupae submerged in water, those submerged in surfactant solution were significantly less resistant to inoculative freezing and had significantly greater puparial water contents. Extracting puparial surface lipids with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v:v) decreased the resistance of non-diapausing pupae to inoculative freezing but did not significantly affect that of diapausing pupae.

T1  - The heat shock response and its regulation in congeneric marine snails (genus Tegula) from different thermal habitats: Implications for the limits of thermotolerance and biogeographic patterning
AN  - 304517492
AB  - Thermal stress sufficient to cause cellular damage activates the heat shock response, the enhanced expression of a group of molecular chaperones called heat shock proteins (hsp's). I compared phenotypic variation and its adaptive importance in the heat shock responses of several congeneric gastropod species (genus Tegula) that occupy thermal habitats differing in absolute temperature and change of temperature. Temperatures of onset (T on), maximal level (Tpeak) and inactivation (Toff) of new synthesis of hsp70 (and protein synthesis per se) were lowest during short-term heat stress in the temperate low-intertidal to subtidal T. brunnea and T. montereyi, intermediate in the temperate mid- to low-intertidal T. funebralis  and highest in the subtropical intertidal T. rugosa. Toff's correlated closely with thermotolerance limits. Toff 's of T. brunnea and T. montereyi were within the range of temperatures that are commonly experienced in the mid-intertidal by T. funebralis. Toff of the temperate  T. funebralis was lower than the highest temperatures experienced by the subtropical T. rugosa. For T. funebralis and T. rugosa, Toff's were only slightly above their highest body temperatures. Thus, Toff is likely to play an important role in setting limits to thermotolerance and distribution. Acclimation to various temperatures changed Ton and Tpeak, but not Toff. Field-acclimatized snails showed an attenuated heat shock response in comparison to laboratory-acclimated specimens, suggesting that factors other than also regulate hsp synthesis. Onset, duration and intensity of the time course of the heat shock response following exposure to 30°C, a frequently experienced temperature for T. funebralis but not for T. brunnea, indicated that the mid-intertidal species, but not the subtidal species, can repair thermal damage and prepare for a subsequent exposure within a high-tide period. Genetically fixed interspecific and acclimation-induced intraspecific differences in Ton are likely to be in part regulated by an hsp70 isoform, hsp72. These results indicate that parts of the model of the cellular thermometer apply to laboratory acclimation. In summary, interspecific variation of features of the heat shock response appear to be of great importance in setting limits to thermotolerance and vertical distribution ranges along the subtidal to intertidal transition.

T1  - A comparative analysis of morphological, physiological, and biochemical adaptation to abiotic stress in intertidal porcelain crabs, genus Petrolisthes
AN  - 304516902
AB  - Organismal tolerance to abiotic environmental stresses contributes significantly to setting the distribution limits of organisms, as demonstrated by vertical zonation patterns in the marine intertidal zone. In this thesis, the ultimate (evolutionary) and proximate (mechanistic) causes of tolerance to temperature and emersion stresses associated with the intertidal zone were examined using porcelain crabs, genus Petrolisthes. Species of  Petrolisthes from intertidal and subtidal microhabitats of four biogeographic regions of the Eastern Pacific were used in phylogenetically-based comparative analyses of morphological, physiological, and biochemical adaptation to environmental stress. A phylogenetic tree based on the sequence of the 16sRNA gene was developed to facilitate these analyses. Organismal thermal tolerance limits are adapted to match maximal microhabitat temperatures. Acclimation of thermal tolerance limits suggests that temperate intertidal zone species are living close to their thermal maximum in nature. Respiratory responses to emersion vary among species from different vertical zones. Experimental examination of oxygen consumption rates and lactate accumulation during emersion suggests that intertidal species are able to respire in air using thin membranous regions on the ventral meral segments of their legs (leg membranes). Leg membrane size is positively correlated with body size across species, but not within a single species. Evolutionary analyses indicate that leg membranes may not have evolved for purposes of aerial respiration, but their presence may have allowed intertidal and subtidal species to achieve larger body sizes and higher metabolic rates. The thermal stabilities of an enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), from 22 species of Petrolisthes varied widely, but were not correlated with maximal habitat temperatures. Comparative analyses did not indicate any evolutionary relationship between LDH thermal stability and microhabitat conditions. Experimental evidence suggests that interspecific differences in LDH stability are genetically based, and are due both to intrinsic properties of the LDH molecules and extrinsic protein stabilizers. Elucidation of the mechanism(s) of LDH stabilization in Petrolisthes may provide novel insight to the field of protein stabilization. These results studies suggest that individual traits may be subjected to differing levels of selection, and thus the analysis of environmental adaptation requires careful consideration of the biological significance of the traits being examined.

T1  - The role of symbiotic dinoflagellates in the temperature-induced bleaching response of Aiptasia pallida
AN  - 304515317
AB  - Bleaching of reef corals and other cnidarians symbiotic with zooxanthellae can be attributed to the stress response of the host, algae or both. To determine if zooxanthellae are involved in the bleaching process, I infected a single strain of sea anemone, Aiptasia pallida with zooxanthellae from different hosts. I measured expulsion of the algae from the host during 24-hour incubations at 25, 32 and 34$\sp\circ$C, as well as photosynthetic rates at these temperatures. Photosynthesis and expulsion of zooxanthellae were inversely and directly proportional to elevated temperatures, respectively. Photosynthesis and expulsion of zooxanthellae isolated from Condylactis gigantea showed the greatest sensitivity to elevated temperature when compared to other zooxanthellae tested. These results suggest that zooxanthellae have a function in the bleaching process and that this function may be related to their photosynthetic response. Thus, the differential tolerance of zooxanthellae to stress could partly explain the spatial variability characteristic of coral-bleaching episodes.

T1  - Oral contraceptive use, physical conditioning, and heat exposure in college women
AN  - 304501615
AB  - The present study examined the cardiovascular and thermoregulatory responses of college women who ingested oral contraceptives (ORAL, n = 10) and those who were eumenorrheic and ovulatory (EU-OV, n = 9). Subjects performed maximum volume of oxygen uptake (VO2max) tests and exercise heat tolerance (EHT) tests during the early follicular phase, before and after an eight-week exercise training-heat acclimation (ET-HA) program. Prior to the EHT tests subjects were dehydrated to –2.69 ± 0.58% (ORAL, EHT test one), –2.94 ± 0.50% (EU-OV, EHT test one), –2.88 ± 0.57% (ORAL, EHT test two), and –2.94 ± 0.46 (EU-OV, EHT test two) via supervised exercise and water restriction. Each week, the ETHA program involved three days of exercise-heat exposure in an environmental chamber and three days of outdoor group running, sit-ups, and push-ups. Results from this research showed that the ORAL group had a significantly higher mean VO 2max value (p < .05) following ET-HA when compared to the ORAL mean pre-training value. When ORAL and EU-OV VO2max values were compared, there were no between-group differences in VO2max, maximum heart rate (HRmax), total exercise time, or rating of perceived exertion (RPE) before or after ET-HA. During the EHT test there were no between-group differences in fluid responses (i.e. dehydration percent weight loss, EHT test arrival weight, urine specific gravity, and EHT test body sweat loss) HR, rectal temperature (Tre), mean weight skin temperature (Tsk), thermal sensation (TS), or RPE before or after ET-HA. The ORAL group exhibited between-test differences (p < .01) in HR at the time period corresponding to the end of exercise during EHT test 1 (END 1).   Between-test differences in Tsk were seen in the EU-OV group (p < .05) five minutes following the end of the EHT tests. Between-test differences in TS were seen in the ORAL group (p < .05) at the 30 minute EHT test stage. The ORAL group showed between-test differences in RPE (p < .05) at the END 1 EHT test stage. Results from this research suggested that ORAL and EU-OV groups were not different when cardiovascular fitness and heat tolerance status were examined before and after ET-HA. In addition, these groups responded similarly to the processes of ET-HA during menstruation.

T1  - The bioenergetics and dehydration tolerance of diapausing embryos from an annual killifish, Austrofundulus limnaeus
AN  - 304499294
AB  - Adult specimens of the annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus  were collected in the Maracaibo basin of Venezuela and transported to the University of Colorado to establish a laboratory stock. Husbandry techniques were developed to provide large quantities of viable embryos for biochemical and physiological studies of embryonic diapause in annual killifish. Studies of the bioenergetics of embryonic diapause reveal a substantial depression in metabolic rate during diapause II and III. Depression of metabolism and arrest of morphological development are temporally offset in diapause II embryos; metabolic rate begins to decline 12 d prior to the onset of diapause II. Diapause II embryos maintain a highly charged adenylate pool during diapause, consistent with a coordinated depression of energy use and demand. High values for AMP/ATP ratios in diapause II embryos are correlated with decreased rates of oxygen consumption and heat dissipation, which suggests a role for AMP in the depression of metabolism in diapause II embryos. Whole embryo rates of protein synthesis are depressed by 90% during diapause II. This substantial depression of protein synthesis can explain a large proportion of the metabolic depression in diapause II embryos. Embryos of A. limnaeus resist loss of cellular water when faced with environmental dehydration. Diapause II embryos are the most resistant to water loss of any developmental stage and can survive for over 100 days in relative humidities higher than 75.5%, while retaining over 50% of their initial water content. Diapause III embryos are poorly resistant to dehydration stress while early embryos (pre-diapause II) have an intermediate resistance. Studies of the structural properties of the egg envelope reveal that the proteinaceous framework is a covalently crosslinked protein aggregate with a high percentage of intramolecular and intermolecular β-sheet secondary structure. The secondary structure of the egg envelope does not change appreciably during the development of resistance to water loss, and thus can not explain the increased resistance of diapause II embryos to environmental dehydration.

T1  - The invasion of the shimofuri goby (Tridentiger bifasciatus) into California: Establishment, potential for spread, and likely effects
AN  - 304496627
AB  - The San Francisco Bay/Delta estuary is dominated by nonindigenous species at nearly every taxonomic level. One of the most recent fish invaders is the shimofuri goby (Tridentiger bifasciatus), native to Asian estuaries. To predict the success and impact of the goby's continuing invasion, I examined its physiology, feeding ecology, and behavioral interactions with potential competitors.    Shimofuri gobies have higher temperature tolerances than most fishes in the estuary (critical thermal maximum = 37°C when acclimated to 20°C). Although they cannot survive in undiluted seawater, shimofuri gobies tolerate wide fluctuations in salinity and can reproduce in fresh water. Thus, while they are capable of inland range expansion, a marine route of expansion is not possible.    Shimofuri gobies are non-selective predators on benthic invertebrates, mainly amphipods, hydroids, and barnacle cirri. Hydroids are rare, and barnacle cirri are absent from the stomachs of other resident fishes. The goby's ability to specialize on seasonally abundant prey and to exploit two novel food sources makes it well-suited to the estuary and partially explains its impressive success relative to many resident species.    In behavioral experiments with three ecologically similar resident fishes, shimofuri gobies were rarely submissive. Prickly sculpins (Cottus asper) and yellowfin gobies (Acanthogobius flavimanus) were rarely aggressive toward shimofuri gobies despite considerable size advantages. Sculpins and tidewater gobies (Eucyclogobius newberryi) were more submissive toward shimofuri gobies than toward conspecifics. Shimofuri gobies were more aggressive toward other gobies than toward sculpins. The invasion of the shimofuri goby is unlikely to be curbed by behavioral interactions with these species. However, if the shimofuri goby becomes sympatric with the endangered tidewater goby, populations of tidewater gobies may be eliminated through competition or predation.    In laboratory experiments shimofuri gobies outcompeted a resident nonindigenous crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) for shelters. This was most pronounced during the day, when predators are active, and during the spawning season, when shelters are in short supply. The goby's invasion is unlikely to be affected by shelter competition with the crab, but the crab may suffer increased predation due to competitive exclusion from shelters.

T1  - Thermal biology of underyearling Lake Inari Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus
AN  - 304493008
AB  - The thermal biology of underyearling Lake Inari Arctic Charr can be described by point-estimators of temperatures where minima or maxima of a certain phenomena occur, and by rate-temperature relationships. Thermal effects may be divided into chronic effects, acute effects modulated by acclimation, and the effects of diel temperature fluctuations.    The ultimate upper incipient lethal temperature of underyearling Arctic charr was found to be $\rm23{-}24\sp\circ C.$ Acclimation to steadily increasing temperatures improved the upper thermal tolerance of fish slightly but the scope of tolerance became narrower with increasing acclimation temperature. Maximum feed intake occurred at a temperature below these survival limits $\rm(14.4\sp\circ C)$ and the optimum for growth of underyearling Arctic charr was within the range of $\rm13.8{-}15.1\sp\circ C.$ Growth efficiency in energy and nitrogen reached its maximum at a lower temperature $\rm(12.4{-}13.2\sp\circ C)$ than growth.    An acute temperature increase of $\rm3.4{-}6.7\sp\circ C$ produced an oxygen consumption peak that declined within 3-4 days. Therefore, the energy metabolism of Arctic charr appeared to be adjusted rapidly (within 3-4 days). Similarly, diel thermal fluctuation $({\pm}1\sp\circ\rm C)$ increased metabolic rate while ammonia excretion, feed intake, growth and faecal losses were not observed to be influenced by this temperature manipulation. Thermal fluctuation resulted in poorer growth efficiencies than the exposure of fish to a constant temperature.

T1  - The thermophysiology of uncompensable heat stress: Influence of hydration status, fluid replacement, aerobic training, physical fitness, and heat acclimation
AN  - 304476378
AB  - The present research was developed to investigate the separate and interactive influences of hydration status, fluid replacement, short-term aerobic training, heat acclimation, and aerobic fitness during exercise in the heat. The research focused on an uncompensable heat stress environment, where the capacity for evaporative heat loss is less than the amount required to maintain thermal steady state. This was produced by either light (3.5 km . h −1, 0% grade, no wind; Studies 1–3) or heavy (4.8 km  . h−1, 4% grade, no wind; Study 1) exercise in the heat (40°C, 30% relative humidity) while wearing a multilayered clothing ensemble with a high insulative capacity and a low water vapour permeability. Study 1 investigated the influences of hydration status (euhydration versus hypohydration of 2.5% body mass), fluid replacement, and exercise intensity. Study 2 investigated the influences of short-term aerobic training and hydration status on unfit (LF) individuals. Study 3 investigated the influences of heat acclimation and hydration status on individuals of both LF and high fitness (HF). Hypohydration resulted in significant increases in cardiovascular and thermal strain and a decrease in exercise tolerance regardless of other factors. Fluid replacement decreased heart rate (fc) and increased tolerance time (TT) during fight exercise. In LF, two weeks of aerobic training or heat acclimation increased sweat rate (SR), but did not influence  fc, rectal temperature (Tre), or TT. In HF, two weeks of heat acclimation increased SR, decreased [special characters omitted] and Tre, but did not influence f c or TT. Neither training nor heat acclimation in LF was able to increase TT to a level similar to that in HF before undergoing heat acclimation. A greater ΔTre over the course of the exercise was present in HF, through a combination of both a lower initial, and a higher endpoint, Tre. The higher endpoint Tre in HF was consistent regardless of hydration, training, or acclimation status. It is concluded that even mild hypohydration can significantly impair physiological responses and tolerance to exercise in an uncompensable heat stress environment, and that high aerobic fitness and habitual activity imparts a degree of protection that cannot be replicated by either short-term training or heat acclimation.

T1  - The ChemChar gasification process: Theory, experiment, and design developments
AN  - 304474719
AB  - This dissertation is the culmination of research on the ChemChar Gasification Process. Equilibrium models have been created that allow predictions of off gas compositions to be made based on minimal in put parameters. In the process of modeling the gasification process several modes of gasifier operations have been studied to compare efficiencies.    Nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds have been successfully gasified without the production of the oxides of nitrogen or sulfur. These two categories of waste has limited the effectiveness of other thermal waste treatment options. The nitrogen is converted to mainly nitrogen gas, with some production of ammonia from ammonium salts and HCN from cyanide salts. The sulfur is converted to either elemental sulfur or a reduced sulfide specie.    Scale-up of the ChemChar process has been accomplished. The process has been taken from the bench top version into a 4 inch continuous feed system that can be used to study surrogate waste mixtures from the Department of Energy. Modifications have been made to the pilot scale reactor for safety and operation concerns.    Scanning electron microscopes have been employed to visual estimate new char products and encapsulation processes. The SEM is used as a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the gasification process.

T1  - The role of cold acclimatization on the biogeography of the mountain chickadee (Parus gambeli) and the juniper titmouse (Parus ridgwayi)
AN  - 304455843
AB  - Biogeographic patterns of animals are shaped by biotic interactions, such as competition, and by abiotic factors, such as climate. Mountain Chickadees (Parus gambeli) and Juniper Titmice (Parus ridgwayi) are permanent residents of regions of western North America and are ecologically similar, but have different northern range limits. I measured several physiological variables, including basal metabolic rate (BMR), peak metabolic rate (PMR = maximal thermogenic capacity), metabolic response to varying environmental temperature (MRT), evaporative water loss (EWL), and daily energy expenditure (DEE) for summer- and winter-acclimatized Mountain Chickadees and Juniper Titmice to determine if seasonal and interspecific variation in cold tolerance and thermogenic ability shape the northern range distribution of these two species. In addition, I examined the ecological consequences of nocturnal hypothermia and cavity roosting in seasonally acclimatized Mountain Chickadees and Juniper Titmice.    Winter birds tolerated colder test temperatures than summer birds for both species. This improved cold tolerance was associated with a significant increase in PMR in winter chickadees (27.1%) and titmice (11.4%) compared to summer. BMR was significantly higher in winter birds (16.0%) compared to summer birds for both species. BMR and PMR were significantly higher for chickadees compared to titmice in both summer and winter. Winter chickadees were able to withstand colder test temperatures than winter titmice. The Mountain Chickadee's lower critical temperature is lower than the Juniper Titmouse's in summer and in winter. The Mountain Chickadee's upper critical temperature is also lower than the Juniper Titmouse's and chickadees also had significantly higher evaporative water loss rates compared to titmice. Seasonal acclimatization in Mountain Chickadees involves insulatory as well as metabolic changes. For Juniper Titmice winter acclimatization appears to be primarily a metabolic process. The laboratory metabolism data for activity costs associated with DEE revealed that foraging energy requirements were not significantly higher than alert perching energy requirements. DEE was significantly higher $(P < 0.05)$ in winter-acclimatized chickadees and titmice compared to their summer counterparts. The marked increase in calculated DEE in winter birds compared to summer contrasts a pattern of increased DEE in the breeding season for several avian species. The data from this study indicate that the northern range limit of small birds can be limited by energetic and water balance demands.

T1  - Water uptake by overstory and understory trees on shallow soils
AN  - 304448094
AB  - Many forest soils are shallow, with soil development limited by a dense layer close to the soil surface. Do these layers limit water uptake to the shallow surface soil or can tree roots take up water in these layers? Does soil water uptake in shallow soil differ with forest vegetation and can this be attributed to root distribution and timing of tree physiological activity? Do trees in these soils respond similarly to drought? Are understory trees subject to more intense competition for water? The goal of this study was to address these questions to better predict water dynamics under different forest vegetation on shallow soils.    A soil water budget approach was used to determine water uptake by a sugar maple plantation, and red pine plantations with understory and with understory removed. Soil water content to a depth of 0.45 m was measured with TDR continuously from June 1992 to November 1995 in a shallow soil in central New York. Simulations were used to estimate water uptake from deeper in the soil profile. Sap-flow of understory trees was measured using a heat-balance method.    Predicted water uptake below 0.45 m averaged about 1 mm per day in all stands even during prolonged drought, though roots were present below this depth. The root density distribution impacted water uptake at depth. There were small differences in soil water uptake patterns that could be attributed to differences in rooting patterns and canopy duration. Osmotic adjustment may occur in both overstory trees in response to prolonged drought. Post-stress recovery to full transpiration occurred rapidly in both over and understory trees. Other responses to severe drought differed among species: reduced leaf area in sugar maple; reduced transpiration in red pine; earlier and more gradual reduction in leaf area, higher sap-flow and tolerance for lower leaf water potentials in black cherry saplings; later and more abrupt leaf senescence and maintenance of higher leaf water potentials at the expense of sap-flow in red maple saplings. The overstory pine responded to removal of understory through increasing root density and water uptake in the surface soil.

T1  - Fundamental cryobiology of mammalian oocytes
AN  - 304446960
AB  - The cryopreservation of mammalian oocytes from various species is becoming an integral part of assisted reproductive technologies in the area of animal reproduction, human reproductive medicine, research, and conservation of rare genetic stocks. Maintenance of the integrity of the oocyte during cryopreservaton procedure is crucial for the normal fertilization and further development following thawing. The limited cryosurvival of mammalian oocytes is mainly due to insufficient information on the biophysical, physiological and ultrastructural properties of the oocytes, which are cryobiologically important. Fundamental changes take place during oocyte development from germinal vesicle (GV) to metaphase II (MII) stage at both cytoplasmic and plasma membrane level. These changes may also affect plasma membrane permeability characteristics that are cryobiologically important. The hypothesis is that the osmotic behavior of oocytes to water and cryoprotective agents (CPAs) may be stage and species specific and thus may require species and stage specific protocols. In order to test the hypothesis, osmotic behavior of GV and MII stage mouse, rat and bovine oocytes was studied in the presence of CPA. These were the determination of: (1) oolemma temperature-dependent hydraulic conductivity (L$\rm\sb{p}),$ cryoprotectant permeability (P$\rm\sb{CPA})$ and their reflection coefficients $(\sigma)$ as well as activation energies for such permeability parameters, and (2) osmotic tolerance limits. These values were then incorporated in the calculation of: (1) optimal procedures for the addition and removal of CPA and its intracellular concentration, (2) cooling rates necessary to minimize intracellular ice formation as well as so-called "solution effects" by estimating water loss kinetics of oocytes during freezing.    The data obtained from this dissertation support the initial hypothesis that osmotic behavior of oocytes from different mammalian species and developmental stages are fundamentally different. Cryopreservation protocol designed for a specific species and developmental stage may not be as successful when it is applied to the others. Therefore, species and developmental stage specific protocols may be necessary to improve cryosurvival of oocytes. In conclusion, it can be suggested that there is a great deal to be learned from a comparative study of the fundamental cryobiology of oocytes from various mammalian species, and understanding the characteristics that are unique to each.

T1  - Isolation of diapause-associated clones from the flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis
AN  - 304441640
AB  - Insects overwinter in periods of arrested developmental called diapause. To further define diapause at the cellular level, an elimination hybridization protocol was used to isolate diapause-associated clones from a cDNA library constructed against diapausing pupal brains. From this primary screening 96 clones were labeled as putative diapause-specific clones, and these clones were then used as probes against diapause and nondiapause poly (A)+ RNA blots for diapause status verification. Three clones were identified as diapause-upregulated and seven clones were diapause-downregulated. Each diapause-upregulated and diapause-downregulated clone was partially sequenced to search for possible identity with other known genes, resulting in similarities to genes linked to cell cycle progression, stress response and DNA repair.    Flow cytometric analysis performed on brains from diapausing and nondiapausing flesh flies confirmed that a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest occurs throughout diapause. This arrest is broken at diapause termination when cells begin to proliferate leading to adult development.    One diapause-downregulated clone (pScD56) was found to have high identity (85%) to the Drosophila melanogaster cell cycle gene, Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) at the amino acid level. Northern blot and in situ hybridization using diapausing pupae and flesh flies that had broken diapause revealed that ScPCNA is expressed at very low levels during diapause, but at diapause termination increase rapidly. Northern blots were also performed using three other G1-associated cell cycle regulatory genes cyclin E, p21 and p53. None of these showed differential expression, suggesting that PCNA alone may be regulating the proliferation arrest observed during diapause.    Heat shock and cold shock are known to inhibit cell cycle progression, so it was of interest to elucidate the possible role of ScPCNA following exposure to temperature extremes. Expression of ScPCNA decreased in response to cold shock (${-}10\sp\circ$C) but not heat shock (45$\sp\circ$C), which is concordant with the current model proposing that the response strategy against high temperature stress is different from the strategy for cold temperature survival.    Finally, the expression of two heat shock transcripts (hsp23 and hsp 70) was tested in response to desiccation stress in the flesh fly. Although both hsps were highly upregulated following desiccation, their expression by desiccation pretreatment was found incapable of inducing cross tolerance against heat and cold stress.

T1  - Ecological and physiological constraints on avian incubation behavior and nest-site selection
AN  - 304439141
AB  - Incubation behavior is one component of reproductive effort and hence influences the evolution of life history strategies. Ambient temperature is commonly thought to influence avian incubation behavior, but results are equivocal. I propose that equivocal results can be partly explained by an incubation model which considers embryonic development and adult metabolism. As this general model predicts, on- and off-bout duration of Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivora celata) were positively correlated with ambient temperature at low temperatures, but were unrelated at very low and more moderate temperatures. Although I found support for the general shape of this incubation model, temperature still explained only a small portion of the overall variation in on- and off-bout duration. Ecological factors other than temperature may help explain additional variation in incubation behavior.    I examined the importance of food, nest predation, and climate in explaining interspecific variation in incubation behavior (nest attentiveness, on- and off-bout durations, and nest trips/hr) for North American passerines. I controlled for body mass and frequency of mate feeding, but neither explained variation in incubation behavior. Nest predation and the ambient temperature typically encountered during incubation explained much of the variation in incubation behavior. Food appears to be less important; diet and foraging strategy explained little variation in incubation behavior. Regardless of the energy cost of incubation, incubating birds face an ecological cost (predation of entire brood) that must be considered in future attempts to explain avian life history evolution.    Avian nest site selection may be influenced by embryo tolerance to temperature or nest humidity if individuals are constrained to place nests within microclimates to which embryos have evolved tolerance. I examined whether embryo thermal tolerance and eggshell permeability differ among sympatric Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis), Orange-crowned Warblers, and Virginia's Warblers (Vermivora virginiae). Thermal tolerance was narrow (37.5-38.0$\sp\circ$C) and did not differ among species. However, Junco eggs were more permeable than warbler eggs. Eggs in nests under moist substrates (maple, fir) contained eggs with higher permeability than eggs in nests under dry substrates (oak, open). If the association between microclimate and eggshell permeability is the result of individual birds seeking nest sites to match the properties of their eggshell, constraints on eggshell permeability may limit nest placement and ultimately breeding distribution.

T1  - Temperature, genetic, and ration effects on juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) bioenergetics
AN  - 304433782
AB  - Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have evolved into an number of distinct strains and subspecies in California where environmental conditions occur. I evaluated effects of temperature, ration level, and genetics on several bioenergetic variables in juvenile California hatchery rainbow trout to test differential responses to temperature hypotheses among four strains: Eagle Lake rainbow trout (O. m. aquilarum), Mt. Shasta strain rainbow trout, little Kern River golden trout (O. m. whitei), and Central Valley steelhead (O. m. irideus).    Golden trout food consumption (SCR) and mortality were temperature-independent from 10–22°C but increased at 25°C; growth (SGR) at 10°C was lower than at 14 to 22°C and growth was minimal at 25°C; resting routine oxygen consumption (MO2) was temperature-independent from 10–19°C, but increased at 22°C and subsequently decreased at 25°C; thermal tolerance (CTM) showed a significant thermal acclimation effect, and; swimming performance (Ucrit) was lower at 19°C than at 10 or 14°C. Eagle Lake and Mt. Shasta strain rainbow trout SCR were temperature-independent at 10 to 19°C and increased with temperature from 19 to 25°C; SGR and MO2 increased with temperature to maximum values between 19 and 22°C and declined from 22 to 25°C; CTM was directly correlated with acclimation temperature, and Ucrit, was temperature-independent. Temperature generally affected steelhead SCR, SGR, and CTM but had no effect on resting MO2, Ucrit, or thermal preference (Tp). Ration level (80% ad lib.) affected steelhead MO2 and SCR, but had no effect on either SGR, CTM, or Tp. The California rainbow trout used in this study have thermal responses reflecting their adaptations to their diverse environments. Similarities among strains were apparent but significant ecophysiological differences among both California and non-California rainbow trout strains and subspecies (from the literature) were also noted.

T1  - Osmoregulation in American shad, Alosa sapidissima, and the role of teleost chloride cells in ion movement
AN  - 304429482
AB  - The osmoregulatory physiology of American shad, Alosa sapidissima, was investigated. Tolerance to full strength seawater developed at the larval-juvenile transition (45 d post-hatch) three months prior to seaward migration. Increased seawater tolerance was associated with gill development, proliferation of chloride cells and increased gill Na$\sp+$,K$\sp+$-ATPase activity. Shad lose the ability to osmoregulate in fresh water during autumnal migration (a possible cue) evidenced by declines in plasma chloride (20%) observed in wild juveniles. Gill Na$\sp+$,K$\sp+$-ATPase activity increases during this period. These changes were observed in the laboratory under natural conditions. Plasma chloride dropped 68% and gill Na$\sp+$,K$\sp+$-ATPase activity increased three-fold. Decreased plasma chloride was associated with increased mortality. Chloride cells (on both the primary filament and secondary lamellae in fresh water) increased during autumn as temperature declined. Changes in physiology and chloride cells are delayed and of a lower magnitude when shad in fresh water were held at constant (24$\sp\circ$C) temperature. In seawater, chloride cells on the secondary lamellae (likely ion uptake cells) declined to less than 2% of fresh water levels. Chloride cells (in both fresh and seawater acclimated shad) were shown to be rich in mitochondria and Na$\sp+$,K$\sp+$-ATPase by developing a technique for using specific fluorescent dyes in fixed tissue. In order to differentiate between the mechanisms of branchial ion uptake and excretion, radioligand binding methods were used to quantify Na$\sp+$,K$\sp+$,2Cl$\sp-$ cotransporters in the gill tissue of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). However, no high affinity binding was measured. The Na$\sp+$,K$\sp+$,2Cl$\sp-$ cotransporter was immuno-histochemically colocalized with Na$\sp+$,K$\sp+$-ATPase to chloride cells in fresh water and seawater acclimated shad. Western blot analysis was used to characterize a 170-190 kDa protein (Na$\sp+$,K$\sp+$,2Cl$\sp-$ cotransporter) present in greater quantities in seawater acclimated shad and Atlantic salmon than in fresh water acclimated fish. The presence of the cotransporter in the chloride cells of seawater acclimated shad supports the accepted model of ion excretion but the immunolocalization of the cotransporter in chloride cells of fresh water acclimated American shad is unexpected and remains poorly understood.

T1  - Ultraviolet radiation, amphibian decline and local population adaptation
AN  - 304427641
AB  - Amphibian population declines have been noted on both local and global scales. Causes for these declines are unknown though many hypotheses have been offered. In areas near human development loss of habitat is a fairly well accepted cause. However in isolated, seemingly pristine, often high elevation, locations the causes are less certain. Suggested causes include pesticide drift from agricultural areas, globally cycled metals which can collect at high elevation locations, other anthropogenic contaminants (such as polychlorinated biphenyls), global warming, increased ultraviolet B radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion, and introduced species competition and predation. The potential role of environmental contaminants or an anthropogenically altered habitat (i.e. ozone depletion, global warming) points to the need to integrate conservation biology and ecotoxicology in assessing causes of amphibian decline. In order to explore the role of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation on native amphibian species a series laboratory and field experiments were undertaken. The first examined the differences between high and low elevation populations of the Pacific treefrog (Hyla regilla) to various intensities of UVB radiation in a solar simulator. Examination of hatching success, survival to limb bud formation, growth and development endpoints, at a single temperature, indicated that the low elevation population was the more sensitive of the two, as would be predicted if high elevation populations have adapted to increased UVB. These experiments further demonstrated that hatching success is not the most sensitive indicator of effect in H. regilla, and that post-hatching growth and development effects are more influenced by UVB. Based on this observed lack of embryonic mortality in the first experiment, the second experiment examined the role of egg mass jelly in protecting two species of anurans ( H. regilla and Bufo canorus) from UVB radiation. This determined that jelly does not protect their developing embryos from UVB radiation and is not a factor in the adaptation of H. regilla  to UVB. The third experiment examined the tolerance of  B. canorus, a high elevation species believed to be declining, to UVB radiation and found this species to be extremely tolerant to all experimental doses including those almost twice current natural exposures. Finally a series of reciprocal transplant field experiments, using H. regilla as a model species, led to the development of a field enclosure suitable for studying developing embryos through premetamorphosis, characterization of a number of sites for metal and pesticide residues, and allowed for observation of high elevation H. regilla breeding habits.

T1  - Differential gene expression in two cold hardy insects in response to low temperatures
AN  - 304419233
AB  - The two cold hardy gall insects, Epiblema scudderiana  and Eurosta solidaginis, employ freeze avoidance and freeze tolerance, respectively, in coping with low seasonal temperatures. Biochemical and metabolic changes in these animals in response to low temperatures have been well documented, but the possibility that cold and subzero temperatures could upregulate genes in these animals has not been investigated. In this study, cDNA library screening and differential display PCR were used to address this question. Animals were sampled over a successive cold (2 weeks at 4°C) and subzero temperature (one week at −20°C) time course. Differential screening/PCR against RNA from control (15°C) animals and Northern analyses revealed a number of upregulated transcripts. All clones were sequenced, and an but two were unidentifiable through GenBank database comparisons, due to the novel and incomplete nature of their sequences. The two identifiable sequences had strong homologies to Drosophila genes mlp60A  and rpA1, encoding respectively, a factor crucial for myogenesis and an acidic ribosomal protein. Implicated in embryonic and adult development, the upregulation of these genes suggests a unique developmental regime in E. scudderiana and E. solidaginis, both of which overwinter as final instar larvae. These animals may be preparing in advance for impending morphogenic changes, allowing for a head-start with the onset of spring.

T1  - Ecophysiological constraints on the distributional limits of nettle-feeding nymphalid butterflies.
AN  - 301627073
AB  - The nymphalid butterflies Aglais urticae, Inachis io, Polygonia c-album and Vanessa atalanta have different U.K. and European distributions, despite their degree of mobility, unspecialised habitat requirements, and the ubiquity of their primary larval hostplant, Urtica dioica. Climate was considered to be the major determinant of distribution in these species, and thus their ecophysiological responses to climatic factors, in particular temperature, were investigated, with a view to identifying mechanisms of range limitation.Developmental responses to a series of constant temperature were measured. Degree-day requirements were found to broadly explain the relative distributions and differences in voltinism of A. urticae, I. io and P. c-album. Vanessa atalanta may be more limited by its ability to overwinter. Paradoxically, the most northerly distributed species, A. urticae, had (a) the highest developmental threshold, and (b) showed higher growth rates, stable pupal weight and lower mortality at 'high' rearing temperatures, compared to the other species.The gregarious, mainly black larvae of A. urticae and I. io were found to regulate body temperature, when exposed to direct solar radiation, at around 32.5 and 31.5 °C respectively. The body temperature of the solitary larvae of P. c-album and V. atalanta, which remained concealed under foliage most of the time, largely conformed to ambient.Thermal and rate summation techniques were compared by modelling development in an artificially shaded field situation. Rate summation models for A. urticae and I. io, and a thermal summation model for P. c-album performed best; reasons for this were discussed. Development by each species in an open, more natural field site was faster than predicted by the respective models. Integration of development, thermoregulation and climate data improved the performance of each model.The distributions of the nettle-feeding nymphalids were found to be predominantly determined by temperature, and it is suggested that the gregarious nature and associated thermoregulatory ability of A. urticae and I. io larvae may be directly responsible for northern range extensions of hundreds of kilometres. The effect of climate change on the distribution and voltinism patterns of each species was briefly discussed.

T1  - Life at its limits: the ecophysiology of the high shore rockpool inhabitant (BL)
AN  - 301584846
AB  - The orange harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus brevicornis is the dominant member of the fauna of high shore rockpools from the Bay of Biscay to Arctic Norway. Its high shore habitat means that the species has to endure physiochemical extremes in salinity, temperature and oxygen. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying these tolerances were unknown prior to the present study.An environmental monitoring programme began in five supralittoral rockpools containing T. brevicornis to record extremes in salinity, temperature and oxygen content over a two year period. The ranges of physiochemical extremes encountered by live (though often dormant) T. brevicornis were 5 to 150 psu, -1 to +32°C and 0 to >20 mg O21-1. A population study was carried out during this period to determine the influence of environmental extremes on population dynamics. Other aspects of high shore ecology studied included the effects of microbiota and seaweed on the ecology of T. brevicornis. This was coupled with a study monitoring other fauna present in the high shore pools to asses the survival of other species in this extreme environment.The osmotic physiology of T. brevicornis was investigated by means of sodium flame photometry and Wescor vapour pressure osmometry combined with a novel squash technique. These studies showed T. brevicornis to be an extremely euryhaline osmoconformer over the range of 10-100 psu. Further studies on body length and density changes under hyper-hypoosmotic stress confirmed its osmoconforming nature.Aspects of the cryobiology of T. brevicornis investigated the effects of acclimation salinity, temperature, starvation and reproductive state on cold temperature tolerance by means of differential scanning calorimetry. Individuals acclimated to higher salinities (70 psu) had a significantly lower mean supercooling point (SCP) (-27.5°C) compared with those acclimated to a lower salinity (5 psu) (-17.7°C).These features of the ecology and physiology of T. brevicornis combine to confer considerable survival potential in high shore rockpools susceptible to extreme physiochemical conditions.

T1  - Biochemical and physiological adaptations of haemoglobin-i genotypes of atlantic cod, gadus morhua l
AN  - 301565546
AB  - The two alleles encoding Haemoglobin-1 in Gadus morhua have a heterogeneous distribution across the north Atlantic: HbI-2 reaches up to 99% frequency in the coldest regions whereas HbI-1 becomes more common in warmer areas. Construction of oxygen binding curves found blood from homozygotes had a similar affinity after the animals were acclimated at 10°C and 16°C but HbI-2/2 had a higher affinity after 4°C acclimation. Both genotypes increased affinity by 40-60% after 16°C acclimation relative to acute 16°C exposure and this was associated with a 50% reduction in red cell organic phosphates. When blood from 10°C-acclimated fish was measured at 4°C and 16°C, HbI-2/2 blood again demonstrated a higher affinity than HbI-1/1.Resting metabolic rate increased with temperature but HbI-1/1 fish showed a higher rate after cold acclimation compared to HbI-2/2. However, HbI-2/2 animals had a 25/30% lower critical oxygen partial pressure (Pcrit) than HbI-1/1 after cold acclimation and acute cold exposure, in contrast to acute warm exposure when HbI-1/1 animals had a 20% lower Pcrit. Cannulation of the afferent branchial artery showed that resting HbI-2/2 cod had a higher red cell pH than HbI-1/1 during acute 4°C exposure although significant differences in in vivo blood parameters between the genotypes were minimal during moderate exercise.The higher affinity of HbI-2/2 blood during acute cold exposure and cold acclimation will improve its oxygen uptake compared to HbI-1/1 animals, especially considering the higher red cell pH of HbI-2/2 blood after acute 4°C exposure. This is evident in the greater hypoxia tolerance of HbI-2/2 animals under these conditions. Consequently, HbI-2/2 cod are better adapted to cold conditions than HbI-1/1 and this is reflected in the prevalence of HbI-2 in cold regions of the Atlantic. The frequency of HbI-2 is particularly high in Greenland and the Baltic where sea ice and a halocline, respectively, may make the water hypoxic.

T1  - Blubber as Insulation--A study of heat balance in harp seals (Phoca groenlandica) and minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorastrata)
AN  - 1521391865; 5472384
AB  - This study has led to the development of a new and suitable device for studies of the thermal conductivity of blubber. The thermal conductivity of the blubber layer of minke whales varies significantly between different regions on the body and has an average value of 0.25/Wm/K, with a range of 0.18-0.35/Wm/K. The thermal conductivity of the blubber layer of harp seals varies from 0.16/Wm/K to 0.20/Wm/K. Baleen whales have a blubber layer of poorer insulating quality than seals. Blubber conductivity is negatively correlated to its lipid content and positively correlated to its water content. To minimize heat loss in cold water harp seals are able to reduce blood perfusion of the blubber and skin to a level where the insulating properties of the blubber is similar to that of dead blubber. To further minimize heat loss in cold water harp seals are able to reduce heat loss from, the flippers to only 5% of metabolic rate by use of vascular countercurrent heat exchangers in the flippers and/or by decreased blood perfusion of the flippers. When harp seals need to increase heat loss, the insulation offered by the blubber layer can be almost totally bypassed by increased blood perfusion of blubber and skin. In addition, the almost uninsulated flippers become important sites for heat dissipation.

T1  - The role of incubation temperature and food intake on phenotype of terrestrial theraphosid spiders (Araneae, Mygaomorphae)
AN  - 304409287
AB  - Temperature variation within the burrows of Brachypelma vagans and Crassicrus lamanai was tested for sensitivity to overlying boulders and burrow entrance plugging. Temperature at 1530 h was significantly warmer in burrows located under boulders than in burrows located away from such features. No trend in the effect of entrance plugging on burrow temperature was evident. The results indicate that burrow-dwelling allows B. vagans and C. lamanai to live within a very narrow temperature range, and suggests that one characteristic of burrow site, the presence or absence of surface rocks, influences the microenvironment within the burrow. Six species of Brachypelma were tested in the laboratory to determine temperature preferenda. Mean temperature preference was 26.9 C. No difference in temperature preference between species was discernible, suggesting that Brachypelma live in similar thermomicroenvironments regardless of their elevational distribution. Two broods of Hysterocrates crassipes were reared colonially with the maternal or a nonmaternal female, or individually contained. Spiderlings raised in solitary were offered prey at high or low regimens. Spiderlings readily fed from large prey subdued by tolerant dams and such spiderlings attained greater mass than siblings reared under other treatments. Cannibalism did not occur in any group. The results indicate that female Hysterocrates and their juvenile offspring exhibit tolerance and interattraction, and are considered periodic-subsocial spiders. Eighteen oothecae of Pterinochilus murinus were incubated at 22.5, 27.0, or 31.5. A total of 1,940 neonates were reared under high or low feeding regimens. Previous literature reporting temperature-dependent sex ratio skewing in Pterinochilus was not supported by this study. High food-treated males were larger and heavier when incubated at 27.0 C than at other temperatures. The most massive high food-treated females were produced under the 31.5 C incubation temperature. Males incubated at 22.5 and 31.5 C were less massive than females incubated at those temperatures, but the 27.0 C incubation temperature yielded sexes of equivalent mass. The results are discussed in light of evolutionary considerations and the implications for captive-management of endangered taxa are addressed.

T1  - The sero-prevalence of Ehrlichia spp. antibodies among canines in Texas and biological factors associated with Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Acari: Ixodidae), the primary vector of E. canis
AN  - 304402846
AB  - Three populations of canines (owned dogs brought to veterinary clinics, dogs from a dog pound, and coyotes) were tested for the prevalence of Ehrlichia spp. antibodies. Sero-prevalence to Ehrlichia ranged from 20.8% among clinic dogs to 84.6% and 62.3% among pound dogs and coyotes, respectively. Ehrlichia sero-prevalence among clinic dogs was positively associated with increased age, occupation as guard dogs or hunting dogs, being kept outside the majority of the time, and a history of travel.    Unfed, adult Rhipicephalus sanguineus males and females were found to have a mean exchangeable water mass of almost 40% of their total body water, which approached 70% among hydrated specimens. Comparisons to Amblyomma americanum ticks revealed that R. sanguineus is significantly more tolerant of dry environments. Unfed R. sanguineus adults were able to survive over a period of 7-8 months when released into a lawn environment in late fall in central Texas. Examination of several ticks during the winter revealed that the brown dog tick appears to overwinter by either becoming quiescent or going into a facultative diapause. Host-seeking among the fall cohort of R. sanguineus adults was found to be primarily dependent on temperature and daylength. Host seeking among ticks released in May appeared to be dependent primarily on just temperature. Daily host-seeking does not appear to be overly affected by age.    Seasonal host-seeking behavior and development appear to be timed so that the following stage will have the greatest chance of surviving to find a host. The development of R. sanguineus eggs, larvae, nymphs and adults in a lawn environment appears to be dependent on temperature. Development and molting appear to slow during times of cold weather and increase as temperatures increase.    The ability of the brown dog tick to overwinter in lawn environments coupled with its tolerance of the relatively xeric conditions found around residential premises, and capacity to complete its life cycle in a short period of time provide a rationale for the rapid establishment of large populations of this tick. Large populations can, in turn, increase the risk of transmission of pathogens.

T1  - The roles of shivering and nonshivering thermogenesis in cold acclimation in the kowari, Dasyuroides byrnei
AN  - 304395597
AB  - The kowari, Dasyuroides byrnei, is a dasyurid marsupial that reportedly undergoes cold acclimation by increasing its basal metabolic rate and cold tolerance. Small placental mammals acclimate to cold by increased capacity for noradrenaline-mediated nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) in brown adipose tissue (BAT). Cold acclimated marsupials lack BAT and do not exhibit a thermogenic response to noradrenaline. This study was designed to measure shivering in kowaris, and determine whether NST plays a role in marsupial thermogenesis. Kowaris were warm acclimated (WA) at 25$\sp\circ$C or cold acclimated (CA) at 10$\sp\circ$C (minimum 4 weeks). Food consumption was measured during acclimation periods: CA kowaris increased daily mass-specific food consumption by 39%. Electromyography could not be used to measure shivering in kowaris, due to their adverse reaction to restraint and electrode attachment. A technique using piezoelectric film was developed to measure shivering tremor in unrestrained, alert kowaris. Shivering tremor, O$\sb2$ consumption, CO$\sb2$ production, evaporative heat loss, body posture and animal activity, and telemetered body temperature (T$\sb{\rm b}$) were measured. Mean T$\sb{\rm b}$ ranges were 33.0 to 38.9$\sp\circ$C (WA) and 32.4 to 38.8$\sp\circ$C (CA), over an ambient temperature (T$\sb{\rm a}$) range of 25 to 0$\sp\circ$C. Mean minimum and maximum body temperatures of WA and CA kowaris were not significantly different (except at T$\sb{\rm a}$ 15$\sp\circ$C), although all values were lower for CA kowaris. Mean T$\sb{\rm b}$ range was narrower for WA kowaris, but not CA kowaris, at low T$\sb{\rm a}$ compared to high T$\sb{\rm a}.$ Body temperature is actively regulated by periodic shivering. Heat production of CA and WA kowaris was not significantly different, yet shivering tremor was significantly lower in CA compared to WA kowaris, under several conditions: in air, at T$\sb{\rm a}$ 20 to 0$\sp\circ$C; during extreme cold stress in a helium-oxygen (helox) atmosphere (T$\sb{\rm a}$ 10 and 0$\sp\circ$C); and during rewarming from lowered body temperatures. Shivering tremor in helox was similar at 10 and 0$\sp\circ$C within both groups, yet heat production was higher at 0 than at 10$\sp\circ$C. The results suggest that NST contributes to thermogenesis in the kowari and is potentiated by cold acclimation.

T1  - Coral reef monitoring: Heat shock proteins as biomarkers of thermal stress in the scleractinian coral Madracis mirabilis
AN  - 304381054
AB  - Coral reefs are being degraded worldwide. To measure and monitor their health, a wide suite of indicators from different levels of biological organization must be used. Biomarkers, and stress proteins/heat shock proteins (HSPs) in particular, may be one tool capable of diagnosing coral health at the individual level that is sensitive to non-lethal exposures. A protein, estimated to have a molecular mass of 26 kDa, was detected in cell free extracts of the scleractinian coral Madracis mirabilis using an antibody to p-26, a small heat shock/$\alpha$-crystallin protein from Artemia. This protein was induced in corals upon exposure to thermal stress. In addition to examining stress proteins in M. mirabilis, coral growth rates and bleaching were monitored to examine the correlation between HSP synthesis and other indicators of stress. Although no clear dose-response relationship was found between the amount of p-26 in corals and the magnitude or duration of heat shocks, acclimation to seasonally elevated temperatures affected HSP synthesis, coral growth rates and visible coral bleaching. Increased tolerance to heat shock after an extended acclimation to elevated temperatures may be the result of enhanced cellular tolerance conferred by the cellular stress response.

T1  - Influence of age on the hemodynamic adjustments to physiological stresses
AN  - 304370983
AB  - The purpose of this series of experiments was to examine the mechanisms which underlie the control of blood pressure in young and older men during exposure to different cardiovascular stresses. Of particular interest was how advanced age may alter the interaction between central cardiac and peripheral hemodynamic responses when maintenance of blood pressure is challenged.    In the first study, young and older subjects (23 $\pm$ 1 vs. 70 $\pm$ 3 years old; p $<$ 0.05). were passively heated to their limit of thermal tolerance with water perfused suits. At the limit of thermal tolerance, a significantly lower forearm blood flow (FBF) in the older men (32 $\pm$ 3 vs. 19 $\pm$ 2 ml$\cdot$100 ml$\rm\sp{-1}\cdot min\sp{-1}$; p $<$ 0.05) was associated with a significantly lower cardiac output $\rm(\dot Q\sb{c})\ (10.9 \pm$ 0.6 vs. 7.4 $\pm$ 0.6 L$\rm\cdot min\sp{-1};\ p<0.05).$ The older men also redistributed less blood flow from their splanchnic and renal circulations (960 $\pm$ 80 vs. 720 $\pm$ 100 ml$\rm\cdot min\sp{-1};\ p<0.05).$ The lower and less redistributed flow from the visceral circulation contributed to the significantly lower increase in skin blood flow (SkBF) in the older compared to the young men (5.8 $\pm$ 0.7 vs. 2.7 $\pm$ 0.3 L$\rm\cdot min\sp{-1};\ p<0.05).$ In addition, the cardiac responses to passive heat stress were altered as an effect of chronological age, with the older men relying on a greater proportion of their chronotropic reserve (62 $\pm$ 3% vs. 75 $\pm$ 4% of maximal heart rate (HR$\rm\sb{max});\ p<0.05)$ to compensate for a reduced inotropic response.    In the second study, the hemodynamic responses to upright tilt were compared in young and older men (23 $\pm$ 1 vs. 70 $\pm$ 3 years old; p $<$ 0.05) in thermoneutral and passively heated conditions. The older men relied on a greater increase in splanchnic vascular resistance (SVR) $(\Delta32\pm10$ vs. $\Delta52\pm8$ units during the heated tilt; p $<$ 0.05) to compensate for a reduced ability to increase muscle and skin vascular resistance, as determined by FBF ($\Delta12\pm4$ vs. $\Delta3\pm3$ units during the heated tilt; p $<$ 0.05). The added stress of a high mean skin temperature $\rm(\bar T\sb{sk})$ during tilting caused a higher incidence of orthostatic intolerance in the young men.    The third study was designed to measure $\rm\dot Q\sb{c},$ stroke volume (SV), and heart rate (HR) in endurance trained older, and more sedentary young men (26 $\pm$ 1 vs. 65$\pm$ years old; p $<$ 0.05) matched for peak oxygen consumption $\rm(\dot VO\sb{2peak})$ and anthropometric variables during submaximal cycle exercise in thermoneutral and warm environments. The older men had a lower relative to younger men at intensities greater than 60% (23.3 $\pm$ 0.6 vs. 20.4 $\pm$ 0.4 $\rm L\cdot min\sp{-1}$ at 85% $\rm\dot VO\sb{2peak};\ p<0.05).$ The older men relied on a greater SV (138 $\pm$ 8 vs. 121 $\pm$ 6 $\rm ml\cdot bt\sp{-1}p<0.05)$ to increase $\rm\dot Q\sb{c}.$ It appears that endurance trained older men can enhance left-ventricular performance to augment SV, but not sufficiently to maintain $\rm\dot Q\sb{c}$ in light of an attenuated HR response during exercise at intensities above 60% $\rm\dot VO\sb{2peak}.$    Based on the results from these experiments, control of blood pressure is well maintained in healthy older men; however, the mechanisms by which blood pressure is maintained is altered. In addition, central cardiovascular changes that occur with advanced age may limit the cardiac responses to stress.

T1  - Evaluation of the use of the bivalves Ischadium recurvum Rafinesque, 1820 and Corbicula fluminea Muller, 1774 as biological indicators of relative water quality in terms of growth and upper temperature tolerance
AN  - 304361218
AB  - Growth of mussels under laboratory conditions was examined under various food regimes in different water types and temperatures. Growth was less than would be useful as an indicator and comparisons with field exposures were of minimal value. The effects of organophosphates on bivalves were examined via toxicity tests, tissue concentration, and by controlling exposure through the use of physical constraints. Upper temperature tolerance of both bivalve species was examined with respect to different acclimation temperatures and organophosphate exposures. Deviations from control exposures occurred at some temperatures. Copper effectively lowered the mean heat coma temperatures of C. fluminea at some concentrations, however, chlorine exposures did not alter heat coma temperature.

T1  - The effects of high temperature and high levels of dissolved solids on the growth and survival of Lahontan cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi
AN  - 304356765
AB  - This research examined the physiological tolerances of Lahontan cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus henshawi clarki, to present and anticipated conditions in Walker Lake, and the Truckee River, Nevada. Laboratory experiments indicate that large fish are more tolerant of high levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) than small fish. Current TDS levels in Walker Lake adversely affected both survival and growth of Lahontan cutthroat trout, and any increase in TDS is likely to decrease survival. Acclimation experiments indicate that acclimation for 3 days to levels of TDS between 3669 and 10300 mg/L should improve stocking success in Walker Lake.    Tests of chronic temperature tolerance indicate that the upper limit for growth and survival of Lahontan cutthroat trout is between 22$\sp\circ$C and 24$\sp\circ$C. Although when exposed to diel cycling conditions ranging from 20-26$\sp\circ$C daily fish increased in mass. Exposure to diel temperature fluctuations did not increase tolerance to subsequent chronic temperature stress conditions.

T1  - The effect of temperature on the biology of two cladocerans
AN  - 304356359
AB  - Temperature dependent growth, respiration, and energy budgets were measured for two temperate and arctic zone zooplanktors. A mechanistic formulation for enzyme kinetics was applied to predict the effects of temperature on whole organisms.    Embryo development rates as a function of temperature, the thermal cues for hatching of dormant or resting eggs, and respiration rates as a function of temperatures and animal size, were measured for Bythotrephes cederstroemi. The complete life cycle of Bythotrephes was observed to have two distinct morphological series. Post embryonic development was documented for parthenogenically produced and sexually produced offspring. A useful temperature dependent model for birth rate calculations in field work was developed based on observable morphological traits of embryos. Temperature and photoperiod are environmental cues that are known to affect the time and success in hatching of diapausing eggs in many species. An increase in temperature above the storage temperature (4$\sp\circ$C) was found to increase the success of hatching Bythotrephes diapausing eggs; however, all temperature treatments had an equivalent effect on success, implying that the cue is discrete and occurs close to 4$\sp\circ$C. Respiration rates for Bythotrephes cederstroemi were measured over a broad range of temperatures. The data was fit to the model f($\sp\circ$K) W$\rm\sp{b}$ where f($\sp\circ$K) is a mechanistic relationship for enzyme activity as a function of temperature. The enzyme kinetic model better described the biological observations of respiration as a function of temperature than standard empirical models.    Energy flow in the arctic Daphnia middendorffiana as a function of temperature was investigated by measuring the processes of ingestion, assimilation, respiration, and growth. The scope for growth and reproduction was determined and compared with the temperate zone species Daphnia pulex. A difference was observed in the arctic species compared to the temperate zone species in both temperature tolerance and energy availability for growth and reproduction at each temperature. Lower energy available for growth and reproduction indicated that physiological mechanisms are less important than life history patterns in allowing D. middendorffiana to exist successfully at the lower temperatures in arctic environments.

T1  - Low temperature biology and overwintering of the Western Flower Thrips, (Franklivella occidentalis).
AN  - 301544931
AB  - In order to establish a new geographical area, non-indigenous insects must be able to tolerate the thermal environment into which they are introduced. The Western Flower Thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) was first detected in the UK in 1986 and has since become an ubiquitous pest of glasshouse crops. The response of F. occidentalis to temperature has been assessed with a view to understanding the role of temperature in determining the potential of the species of establish in the UK. Linear modelling of development rate, as a function of temperature, estimated a threshold of 7.9°C, and a requirement of 268 degree-days for complete development, allowing between three and five generations to be completed annually in the Midlands region of the UK. Thus, inadequate thermal input is unlikely to limit the ability of this species to complete its life cycle and establish in the UK. The cold tolerance of larval and adult F. occidentalis was also assessed in the laboratory. Both age groups died at temperatures above their whole body freezing temperature, in acute and chronic cold exposure, though adults were more cold hardy.Larvae and adults were able to increase their cold tolerance over several days in response to low temperature (with a short photoperiod). Field experimentation confirmed that F. occidentalis is unlikely to survive in an open field situation, for the duration of a harsh UK winter, but a level of cold tolerance that would be adequate for survival of mild winters or short exposures to sub zero temperatures was observed. However, chill treatment reduced the developmental capacity, reproductive rate, reproductive lifespan and realised fecundity of surviving insects. Acute exposure to lower temperatures also resulted in a reduction of the same parameters. Such a decrease in generative capacity may be important in determining the capacity of overwintered (and subsequent) generations to persist in the UK. In addition to a protracted acclimation, F. occidentalis was capable of rapid cold hardening in response to sudden, and certain more gradual, changes in temperature.

T1  - Overwintering and developmental biology of the hoverflies Episyrphus balteatus (Degeer) and Syrphus ribesii (L.) (Diptera, syrphidae).
AN  - 301537466
AB  - Episyrphus balteatus and Syrphus ribesii are important syrphid predators of aphids in the UK. Previously, very little was known about the overwintering biology of these species. Efficient rearing methods are described for the culture of the two species of hoverfly. The effect of temperature on the developmental rate of E. balteatus is studied. The developmental threshold is estimated as 6.8°C with a day-degree requirement of 261 day-degrees above the threshold using weighted linear regression. It is suggested that for E. balteatus one to three generations are possible each year. E. balteatus is thought to overwinter in the UK as adults, this now seems unlikely as adult E. balteatus have limited cold hardiness and die after 10 weeks exposure to winter field conditions. Under laboratory conditions, 50% of acclimated adults die after only approximately 7 days in constant exposures at 0 and -5°C. As spring migrants are the likely source of the UK population of E. balteatus in this country, only one and at the moment two generations would occur in the "summer" season. In contrast to the overwintering morph of E. balteatus, third instar larvae of S. ribesii are strongly freeze tolerant, surviving short exposures to temperatures as low as -35°C. Length of acclimation, external moisture and presence of gut content all affect the level of freeze tolerance in laboratory reared S. ribesii larvae. The overwintering biology of hoverflies is discussed together with the significance of the discovery of a freeze tolerant insect in the UK, particularly in relation to its ecology and potential economic importance.

T1  - Ecology of the crane-fly tipula montana in an upland environment
AN  - 301497628
AB  - This study investigated the ecology of a boreo-alpine crane-fly, Tipula montana Curtis (Diptera: Tipulidae), on a Scottish mountain summit.  It explored adaptation to the upland environment, placing emphasis on sources of variation in growth, abundance, and low temperature tolerance.The development stages of larvae were reliably identified from measurements of the spiracular disc diameter.  The sex of larvae were distinguished by the bimodal frequency distribution of weights in the 4th instar.  Larvae were sampled by hand searching and collecting off snow patches, between 1994 and 1996.  The timing and size of development stages indicated that the population possessed a 2-year life cycle, supported by evidence from adult emergence. However, by rearing larvae of known developmental stage at the field site, it was shown experimentally that microhabitat could affect growth, and that it was likely to be related to temperature.  In the laboratory, pre-pupal development was shown to be temperature dependent.2nd instar larvae were reared on single bryophyte diets, from a range of genera.  They were all capable of growth and moulting, although final weights differed by a factor of 2.  A pair-wise preference experiment, using 4th instars, showed the individuals broadly chose bryophyte foods as expected from their quality, although the sedge Carex bigelowii was preferred over all mosses.  No intersexual difference was detected.  The observational method of assessing preference, compared to faecal pellet analysis, showed a bias towards some species, perhaps because they acted as a refuge.  The pellet contents of a small number of larvae from the field were largely unidentifiable.Larval cold tolerance was investigated in the laboratory.  The supercooling points of 3 different species (T. montana, T. varipennis & T. confusa), from upland and montane habitats, were very similar in autumn and spring, ranging from means of -4.5 to -6.0oC.

T1  - Physiological and evolutionary consequences of protein metabolism in <i>Mytilus edulis</i> l.
AN  - 1777857503
AB  - Rates of whole body protein turnover (WBPT) vary greatly in individual mussels (Mytilus edulis). These differences correlate with the heterozygosity of polymorphic enzyme loci and with aspects of individual physiological performance. Using a technique for the identification of individual proteins which account for the documented differences in rates of WBPT, this study has demonstrated a heterogeneity of turnover rates between individual proteins in mantle tissue. For some of these proteins, relative rates of turnover correlated with genotype and with aspects of physiological performance. The cellular stress response plays an important role in protection of organisms against the accumulation of abnormal proteins. Thermotolerance induced by elevated levels of endogenous cellular stress proteins seems to be especially significant in the seasonal adaptation of ectotherms. Endogenous levels of stress-70 proteins in mussels vary seasonally and correlate with seasonal changes in environmental temperature and with thermotolerance. These results indicate that environmental stress is sufficient to cause protein denaturation during a significant part of the year, and that high natural concentrations of stress-70 proteins promote thermotolerance. The exposure of M edulis to copper did not lead to significantly elevated levels of stress proteins, and copper tolerance was not effected by seasonal changes in temperature. The development of a gene probe for the measurement of hsp70 mRNA allowed differences in the accumulation of hsp70 mRNA to be observed between intertidal and subtidal M. edulis. These findings are relevant to the ways in which molecular changes in protein metabolism contribute to environmental adaptation in marine invertebrates, and hence have consequences for the ecological dynamics of these organisms.

T1  - Nest-site selection, energetics of reproduction and comparative behaviour of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and blue-winged teal (Anas discors)
AN  - 304336787
AB  - An organism's reproductive success may be affected by choice of breeding habitats and subsequent investment in offspring. Nest microclimate may profoundly influence energetic costs of incubation or embryonic survival, but few studies have evaluated whether birds select nest-sites based on microclimate. Likewise, increased investment of nutrients in eggs may have costs in terms of future survival and reproduction. These ideas have received only limited testing, particularly behavioural and physiological responses to clutch size variation of precocial birds. Therefore, I evaluated whether: (1) ducks select nest-sites for thermal features; and, (2) incubation behaviours, incubation periods, or energetic costs of incubation are related to clutch size.    Blue-winged teal (A. discors; hereafter teal) nested most often in grass or short shrub habitats, while mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) nested in all habitats. Within nesting habitats, microclimate followed a gradient from hot and sunny in grass-dominated sites to cool and shaded sites in aspen (Populus spp.) groves.    I measured microclimatic conditions at mallard and teal nests and randomly located nonnest sites, to evaluate thermal consequences of nest-site selection. Duck nests received on average less solar insolation than nonnest sites, producing more moderate thermal conditions than at nonnest sites. When mallard and teal nests were concurrently monitored, teal selected warmer nest-sites than mallards. Thus, teal may choose warmer nests to offset costs of incubation, a hypothesis which has not been tested.    Apart from egg formation costs, processes occurring during incubation may also limit clutch size of precocial birds. I tested if incubation periods were positively correlated with clutch size and found that incubation periods of captive mallards and wild teal, but not wild mallards, were longer for females incubating clutches enlarged by 50%. Incubating females may respond to increased energetic costs of incubation by: (1) losing more mass, (2) decreasing nest attendance, or (3) some combination of both. Mass loss and mass at hatch were unrelated to clutch enlargement, however, mass loss was positively correlated with mass at the start of incubation. While controlling for effects of weather, I found no change in incubation behaviours of mallards incubating enlarged clutches, but, teal increased overall recess frequency. Finally, I evaluated effects of clutch enlargement on incubation strategies, representing an integration of behaviour and body mass dynamics. When controlling for weather and body mass dynamics, clutch enlargement produced significant, yet subtle changes in incubation behaviours. Mallards took slightly shorter recesses, but maintained constancy, whereas teal increased recess frequency and decreased nest attendance.    Energetic costs of incubation are controversial. I tested if incubation metabolic rates (IMR) were greater than resting metabolic rate (RMR). Incubation caused an increase in metabolic rate by mallard and red junglefowl (Gallus gallus spadiceus). I tested the assumption that IMR is positively correlated with clutch size and found that IMR of junglefowl within thermoneutrality was unrelated to clutch mass. Further work is needed to evaluate metabolic responses of precocial birds to clutch size variation. Overall, clutch size of precocial birds (particularly small species) may be limited by costs in terms of extended laying and incubation periods, as well as by subtle changes in incubation behaviours. Further integration of incubation costs with those associated with egg formation and brood-rearing, would provide a comprehensive and powerful analysis of factors limiting clutch size in precocial birds.

T1  - Endurance training, heat acclimation, and protective clothing: The thermophysiology of exercising in a hot climate
AN  - 304323564
AB  - Protective clothing imposes significant physiological and psychological stresses on the human body, especially in hot environments. Perhaps the most important constraint is the limited vapor permeability of the clothing. Endurance training and heat acclimation are both commonly adopted tactics to improve tolerance times when individuals must work in the heat. However, it is unclear whether training and acclimation are helpful where personnel must wear protective clothing. The main purpose of this research was thus to examine how the benefits of training and acclimation are modified by wearing protective clothing.    Experiment 1 studied effects of training in subjects who all received heat acclimation. Seven young men underwent 8 weeks of physical training (60-80% of maximal aerobic power $\rm(\dot VO\sb{2\max})$ for 30-45 $\rm min{\cdot}day\sp{-1},$ 3-4 $\rm days{\cdot}week\sp{-1}$ at 20-$22\sp\circ\rm C\rbrack$ followed by 6 days of heat acclimation (45-55% $\rm\dot VO\sb{2\max}$ for 60 $\rm min{\cdot}day\sp{-1}$ at $40\sp\circ\rm C,$ 30% relative humidity). Nine other young men underwent corresponding periods of control observation and heat acclimation. Experiment 2 examined heat acclimation without training; eight young men were heat-acclimated for 6 days, and eight other young men for 12 days. Before and after each treatment, subjects completed bouts of treadmill exercise at $40\sp\circ\rm C,$ 30% relative humidity, wearing in turn normal clothing (continuous exercise at 30-45% $\rm\dot VO\sb{2\max})$ or protective clothing (continuous exercise at 40-50% $\rm\dot VO\sb{2\max}$ in Experiment 1; intermittent exercise at 20-25% $\rm\dot VO\sb{2\max}$ in Experiment 2).    When wearing normal clothing, training or acclimation decreased physiological (rectal temperature $\rm(T\sb{re}),$ mean skin temperature $\rm(\bar T\sb{sk}),$ and/or heart rate (HR)) and psychological variables (ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and/or thermal discomfort (RTD)) during the test exercise; acclimation responses were about twice as large after 12 than after 6 days. When wearing protective clothing, training did not change physiological or psychological responses. Acclimation reduced $\rm T\sb{re}$ and/or $\rm\bar T\sb{sk}$ when wearing protective clothing, irrespective of the duration of acclimation or the intensity of exercise, but HR and RPE and/or RTD were reduced only at the lower intensity of exercise. After training or acclimation, tolerance times were unchanged when exercising at the moderate intensity, but were increased by 10-15% when exercising at the low intensity. It thus appears that the physiological and psychological strains imposed by wearing protective clothing are reduced after acclimation only if a person is working at a low rate.

T1  - The development of urban heat islands in the southeast region of the United States in the winter season
AN  - 304317654
AB  - The study of the urban heat island has gained increased importance due to its relation to global warming. The effect of urbanization and land use changes in general on thermometer readings can bias long-term records resulting in a false global warming signal. Therefore, understanding the urban heat island phenomenon is important for an assessment of the global warming magnitude.    A modeling approach has been chosen since it can overcome some restrictions of "conventional" methods (in situ and satellite observations), such as limited spatial and temporal resolution and topography effects. Models can provide better resolution and extend our understanding of the underlying physics of urban heat island development.    In order to demonstrate this concept, the city of Atlanta was selected for numerical simulation under clear sky conditions on 6-7 and 25-26 February 1988. A mesoscale model developed by Pielke (1974) was employed in the numerical simulation. The first step was determination of the soil thermal inertia and moisture availability using AVHRR satellite-derived skin surface temperatures in a technique developed by Carlson et al. (1981). The thermal inertia exhibited elevated values over the city in both cases. The moisture availability field showed a larger degree of variability. The case of 25-26 February 1988 exhibited lower values of moisture availability in the city as compared to the rural surroundings, which is considered to be a typical situation. However, the case of 6-7 February 1988 showed extremely high moisture availability in the city. A possible explanation can be found in the cumulative rainfall, which shows a positive correlation between 14-day cumulative rainfall amount and the moisture availability.    A technique proposed by Hjelmfelt (1982) was used to simulate the urban effect. The urban heat island itself was investigated in terms of the skin surface and 2-m height temperatures. The horizontal and temporal evolution of these variables was modeled. In both cases the maximum magnitude occurred at night; the daytime urban heat islands were varied, sometimes even negative, i.e., "cool" islands. The maximum urban heat island magnitude of 25-26 February case was about $\rm 0.8\sp\circ C$ for both 2-m height and skin surface temperatures. The second case of 6-7 February exhibited lower magnitude of the urban heat island of $\rm 0.5\sp\circ C$ for 2-m height temperatures and $\rm 1.0\sp\circ C$ for skin surface temperature.    An analysis of the surface energy balance components shows the main factors leading to the urban heat island development. During the night the ground and sensible heat flux are the dominant components. The latent heat flux is important during the day when the surface moisture availability is high, which was the case on 6-7 February.    Thus, it can be concluded that although the urban heat island is predominately a nocturnal phenomenon, during the day it may actually be negative. The temperature minima and diurnal range is affected by the urbanization more than the temperature maxima. Under "ideal" conditions the effect of an urban area on the minima or the diurnal range can be about 0.8$\sp\circ\ -$1.0$\sp\circ$C; the effect on the maxima can be about $-$0.5 to $\rm 0\sp\circ C.$

T1  - Genetic variation in diapause, cold hardiness and circadian eclosion rhythm in Chymomyza costata
AN  - 304304801
AB  - Chymomyza costata Zetterstedt is a holarctic drosophilid, the diapause and overwintering stage of which is the third instar larva. Diapause and eclosion rhythmicity were studied in strains of different geographical origin, from Japan (43$\sp\circ$N) and Finland (62-68$\sp\circ$N), and cold-hardiness in Japanese strains. The material also included a non-diapause mutant strain originating from Japan which had lost the photoperiodic diapause response.    Both diapausing and non-diapausing third instar larvae were freezing tolerant, provided that the freezing was started by inoculation at near-zero temperatures and the cooling rate after the initial freezing was slow. Cold acclimation greatly increased cold tolerance and the capacity to withstand higher cooling rates.    The critical photoperiod and the critical temperature of diapause induction were found to increase clinally from south to north. The form and position of the two clines could be explained when data on the estimated number of generations per year were combined with data on weather and light conditions at each locality. Results of crossing and selection experiments showed that there are at least two loci controlling the critical photoperiod in C. costata, one located on the X chromosome and the other autosomal. The non-photoperiodic diapause trait is controlled by one recessive autosomal gene.    The amplitude of pupal eclosion rhythm in diel photoperiods and thermoperiods was low in wild type strains at and above 19$\sp\circ$C and practically non-existent in the mutant non-photoperiodic diapause strain. The amplitude of eclosion rhythm decreased towards the north, repeating the trend observed in other drosophilidae from the same region. The amplitude increased at lower temperatures, and all strains showed rhythmic eclosion at the lowest temperatures (around 11$\sp\circ$C). The free-running rhythm of eclosion damped rapidly, the rate of damping not being dependent on temperature.    Genetic dissection experiments were conducted with the Japanese mutant non-photoperiodic diapause strain and a wild type strain to assess the connection between diapause and eclosion rhythm. The results suggested that the arrhythmicity of eclosion and lack of photoperiodic diapause in the mutant strain are caused by the same gene or are controlled by separate but closely linked loci.

T1  - Thermal ecology of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) in south-central Florida
AN  - 304303668
AB  - During 1994 and 1995, I studied several aspects of the thermal ecology of the gopher tortoise in south-central Florida. My findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Body temperatures of hatchings in laboratory thermal gradients were influenced by hydration and nutritional status. Individuals selected lower body temperatures when dehydrated than when hydrated, presumably to reduce further evaporative and respiratory water loss. Individuals also selected higher body temperatures when fed than when fasted, which may enhance digestion when fed and reduce energy expenditure when fasted. (2) Laboratory studies revealed no effect of ontogeny on heat tolerance or thermal preference. However, radiotelemetry of free-ranging individuals during summer revealed that juveniles apparently thermoregulated less effectively than adults. When preferred body temperatures were physically attainable, such body temperatures were maintained 88% of the time by adults but only 56% of the time by juveniles. Juveniles allowed their body temperatures to stray from preferred primarily during the morning as a result of delayed emergence and at night. Rather than occupy the warmest parts of burrows near the entrance, all juveniles were observed to spend the night at a depth of approximately one meter where they were cooler than preferred but safer from nocturnal predators such as racoons. (3) Gopher tortoises acclimatized to seasonal changes in their thermal environment by modifying their tolerance of high body temperatures. Heat tolerance increased from spring to summer, decreased in fall, and declined further in winter. Lab experiments suggested that proximate stimuli for these changes were temperature acclimation and photoperiod acclimation. Interestingly, tortoises did not exhibit seasonal changes in selected body temperatures when placed in laboratory thermal gradients. In the field, radiotelemetered adults maintained body temperatures within the preferred range $>$80% of the time that it was physically possible throughout the year. This seasonal consistency of thermoregulation was accomplished primarily by modification of basking behavior, with tortoises basking during spring and fall but not during summer. At all times of the year, adults restricted foraging activity to the hottest part of the day. In doing so, they elevated body temperatures to maximal preferred levels by sunset and thereafter maximized nighttime body temperatures.

T1  - Patterns and processes of enzyme evolution in the Fundulus clade
AN  - 304279150
AB  - One of the central questions in physiology is the control of metabolism. The type and number of enzymes that must be altered to produce changes in flux through a pathway has been intensely debated. Some theories state that only rate-limiting non-equilibrium enzymes control flux while others argue that equilibrium enzymes can also modulate flux. In order to test the predictions of the various metabolic control models, all the enzymes in a single metabolic pathway must be examined. Maximal initial activity of all the glycolytic enzymes is quantified in this work as a measure of enzyme concentration.    Evolutionary alterations in concentration can be used to identify important enzymes. If an enzyme's concentration appears to show adaptive variation, then this variation should have functional consequences that affect the fitness of the organism. Since temperature is an important environmental factor, temperature adaptation is examined in species in the teleost fish genus Fundulus. This genus has species distributed along the steep thermal cline of the North American Atlantic Coast. Environmental adaptation can be achieved by both physiological acclimation and evolutionary adaptation.    Physiological acclimation of enzyme concentration is evolutionarily labile and has arisen at least three times in the genus Fundulus. Two of the three events have occurred recently in equilibrium enzymes in different Atlantic species while the third, in a non-equilibrium enzyme, is more ancient and conserved within one subgenus. No one enzyme shows an acclimation response in all the Atlantic species, so Fundulus acclimation responses do not support any one metabolic control model.    Evolutionary adaptation of enzyme concentration appears to have occurred in three enzymes, GAPDH, PYK and LDH. Variation in the concentrations of these enzymes correlate significantly with mean annual temperature, even after taking into account phylogenetic effects. Several enzymes show significant positive coevolution with each other. PGI covaries with ALD and GAPDH covaries with LDH. Thus variation in the concentrations of four equilibrium enzymes and one non-equilibrium enzyme appears to be adaptive and thus has functional consequences. These data support metabolic control theories which argue that many enzymes, regardless of type, can affect flux.

T1  - Histomorphological responses of red shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis) to atrazine, terbufos, and their mixture
AN  - 304274142
AB  - Alterations of normal histomorphology of fish tissues, behavior, and thermal tolerance are recognized by environmental toxicologists and fish biologists as powerful tools indicating diverse biochemical and physiological changes. Toxicity of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine), terbufos (S-(((1,1-dimethyl-ethyl)thio)methyl)O,O-diethyl phosphorodithioate), and their mixture to red shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis) at 23$\sp\circ$C and 30$\sp\circ$C was investigated in 14-d bioassays after 14-d acclimation. During the bioassays, fish behavior, indications of toxicosis, and external anomalies were observed. After the bioassays, the critical thermal maximum (CTM) was determined. Fish also were preserved for examinations of gill, liver, and kidney tissues using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy (LM). SEM and LM revealed exacerbated gill lesions in pesticide-exposed fish, distinguishable from the pre-existing mild lesions in the controls. Gill abnormalities included curling, clubbing, fusion, hyperplasia causing fusion, shortening of lamellae, epithelial swelling, hemorrhagic globes, respiratory epithelial uplifting, alteration of mucous cells, coagulation of mucus, and reduction or loss of pavement cell microridges. Gill lesions in fish exposed to the pesticide mixture were similar to those from exposure to each chemical alone, however some effects were more severe, suggesting additive or synergistic effects. Liver cytopathology were more prominent at 100 $\mu$g terbufos/L and 1000 $\mu$g atrazine/L + 100 $\mu$g terbufos/L than at 1000 $\mu$g atrazine/L. Kidneys of fish exposed to terbufos and the mixture exhibited flower-like appearance of Bowman capsules and proliferation in number and size, while atrazine had no effect. Overall survival was lowest for the pesticide mixture (92% at 23$\sp\circ$C or 48% at 30$\sp\circ$C), in comparison to atrazine only at 30$\sp\circ$C (54%), terbufos (97% at 23$\sp\circ$C and 91% at 30$\sp\circ$C), or the controls (100% survival) at both temperatures. Altered fish behavior (e.g., hyperactivity, loss of schooling, over-schooling, hypoactivity, inhibition of feeding, loss of equilibrium) and anomalies (e.g., light coloration, softness of muscle tissues, scoliosis) were evident after exposure. CTM decreased significantly after exposure to the pesticides at both temperatures. This combination of histomorphological, behavioral, and thermal tolerance changes demonstrated how atrazine and terbufos can affect C. lutrensis in nature, rendering them more susceptible to predation, competition, or disease.

T1  - Hyperhydration: Thermoregulatory effects during compensable and uncompensable exercise-heat stress
AN  - 304243155
AB  - This study examined the efficacy of hyperhydration approaches during compensable and uncompensable exercise-heat stress and the impact of hyperhydration on physiologic response and tolerance to heat strain. The general approach was to determine if 1-h pre-exercise hyperhydration (29.1 ml$\cdot$kg LBM$\sp{-1}$ with or without glycerol 1.2 g$\cdot$kg LBM$\sp{-1}$) provided a physiologic advantage. During compensable heat stress (CHS) the evaporative heat loss required (E$\rm\sb{req}$ = 293 W$\rm\cdot m\sp{-2}$) to maintain steady-state core temperature was less than the maximal capacity (E$\rm\sb{max}$ = 462 W$\rm\cdot m\sp{-2}$) of the climate for evaporative heat loss (E$\rm\sb{req}$/E$\rm\sb{max}$ = 63%). During uncompensable heat stress (UCHS) the E$\rm\sb{req}$(366 W$\rm\cdot m\sp{-2}$) was greater than E$\rm\sb{max}$(88 W$\rm\cdot m\sp{-2}$; E$\rm\sb{req}$/E$\rm\sb{max}$ = 416%) and core temperature continued to rise until exhaustion from the heat strain occurred. Eight heat-acclimated men completed 5 trials (euhydration, glycerol hyperhydration, and water hyperhydration both with and without rehydration (replace fluid lost during exercise) in CHS and 3 trials (control, glycerol hyperhydration and water hyperhydration) in UCHS. During exercise in the heat (35$\sp\circ$C, 45% rh) there was no difference between hyperhydration methods for increasing total body water. During CHS, hyperhydration did not alter core temperature, skin temperature, whole body sweating rate, local sweating rate, sweating threshold temperature, sweating sensitivity, or heart rate responses compared to euhydration trial. Likewise, no difference was found between water and glycerol hyperhydration for these physiologic responses. During UCHS, hyperhydration did not alter thermal or cardiovascular (stroke volume, cardiac output, blood pressure, total peripheral resistance) responses or heat strain tolerance compared to the control trial. In addition, it was observed that glycerol solution ingestion often results in nausea and headaches. It is concluded that hyperhydration provides no meaningful advantages over the maintenance of euhydration during exercise-heat stress.

T1  - Studies on the biology and ecology of the free swimming larval stages of lepeophtheirus salmonis (kroyer, 1838) and caligus elongatus nordmann, 1832 (copepoda: caligidae)
AN  - 301593481
AB  - The study investigated biological and ecological parameters controlling and influencing the production and distribution of the free-swimming larval stages of Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer, 1838), and to a lesser extent Caligus elongatus Nordmann 1832, in the natural environment The reproductive output of L. salmonis was influenced by seasonal effects. The number of eggs produced per brood showed an inverse relationship with increasing temperature. The number of eggs per brood was also influenced by adult female body size (cephalothorax length), which in itself exhibited an inverse relationship with increasing temperature. Photoperiod had no significant effect upon the number of eggs produced or on adult female size. Mean egg size of L. salmonis varied significantly over the year; larger eggs were produced during the summer months and smaller eggs over the winter. However, factors controlling the size of the eggs were not elucidated. The proportion of viable eggs per L. salmonis ovisac remained constant throughout the year. Large variations in egg number per egg string were found in both L. salmonis and C elongatus populations sampled at one point in time. These were attributed in part to phenotypic variation in adult female size and also the number of broods individual females had produced. Egg viability was not correlated with brood size, but mean egg size was related to the number of eggs per brood. Experimental studies indicated that hatching and development of L. salmonis was highly variable. The percentage of eggs hatched and the time period over which hatching occurred varied markedly, even when held under constant and optimal environmental conditions. Temperature did not affect hatching success or viability of the nauplius I stage, although at higher temperatures the period over which hatching occurred was reduced. Low and medium salinities caused a significant decrease in both hatching success and nauplius viability. Photoperiod had no effect on initiation of hatching. Hatching occurred in a manner similar to that observed in free-living copepods. The nauplii were enclosed by two egg membranes, the outer one bursting within the ovisac, the inner one after the ovisac membrane has split. Swelling of the egg and its subsequent hatching was attributed to osmotic effects, with water being taken up from the external environment. Development was also highly dependent upon both temperature and salinity. At 5'C, nauplius 11 stages failed to enter the moult to the copepodid stage. At 7.5'C, although moulting was initiated, in a large proportion of cases it was not successfully completed. At I O'C, development to the copepodid stage was successful. Nauplii only developed successfully to the copepodid stage at salinities of 25%o or greater. Copepodids raised under optimal conditions then exposed to a range of salinities had a greater salinity tolerance than nauplii. Biochemical analysis of the eggs of L. salmonis revealed that lipids constituted a large proportion of their dry weight. Naupliar stages contained a discrete area containing lipid which decreased in size over time, suggesting that the free-swimming larval stages utilised this as an energy reserve. Rate of depletion was faster in nauplii held at higher temperatures. Longevity, activity and infectivity of the infective stage decreased with age. However, both spontaneous and stimulus dependent activity ceased many hours before death and both activity and longevity were affected by temperature. Infectivity of I day old L. salmonis copepodids was higher than 7 day old larvae, and was considered to be related to the size of the energy reserves. The settlement and distribution pattern of copepodids did not change with age of copepodid, the majority being recorded from the fins. All three L. salmonis free-swimming larval stages demonstrated a "hop and sink" swimming pattern. The velocity and duration of both passive sinking and active swimming was recorded for both nauplii and copepodids. Although greater periods of time were spent passively sinking, the speeds obtained during both upward spontaneous and stimulated swimming meant that a net upward movement of larvae in the water column occurred. At higher temperatures spontaneous swimming activity increased, whilst low salinities caused a cessation of such ability. L. salmonis larvae were positively phototactic and negatively geotactic. As well as their positive responses to light intensity, the nauplius 11 and copepodid stages reacted positively to blue-green spectral wavelengths. Moulting times were relatively short, although the larvae were not able to swim during such periods. No relationship was found between the level of lipid reserves and the overall buoyancy of the larvae. Naupliar stages of both L. salmonis and C. elongalus were obtained from the water column as a result of a plankton sampling programme at a commercial Atlantic salmon farm. No copepodid stages of either species were found. There was no difference in the vertical distribution of the two L. salmonis naupliar stages. Live larvae tended to aggregate between 0 and 5m in depth, with no diurnal vertical migration. Dead nauplii, and those with low lipid reserves, were found deeper in the water column. Naupliar stages, and in particular the first larval stage, were concentrated in number within cages indicating that the cages have a retentive characteristic. A novel control method in the form of a commercially available light lure was tested. Though increasing the numbers of free-living copepods captured, it had no effect on the numbers of L. salmonis naupliar or copepodid stages obtained in plankton samples. The present study has therefore provided valuable data concerning the biology and ecology of the free-swimming larval stages of sea lice, in what was a comparatively poorly understood area.

T1  - Acclimatory responses to environmental temperature in two species of marine crab: the stenothermal Cancer pagurus and the eurythermal Carcinus maenas.
AN  - 301529506
AB  - Temperature acclimation effects on leg muscle plasma membrane composition and biophysical state, neuromuscular function and whole organism thermal tolerance, and their dependence on the background seasonal acclimatization were investigated in the eurythermal Carcinus maenas and the stenothermal Cancer pagurus.  Correlations between the changes observed at each of these levels are discussed.The average winter (5°C), annual (8°C), and summer (15°C) sea-water temperatures and a warmer summer temperature (22°C) were chosen as acclimation temperatures for their ecological significance.Warm-acclimation (22°C) increased the thermal tolerance (CTMax) of both species and induced partial compensation of the neuromuscular function (assessed from leg nerve axonal conduction velocity and the amplitudes of excitatory junction potentials in dactylopodite closer muscle fibres).  The time-course of acclimation showed it was complete after two weeks, but a longer exposure to 22°C reduced neuromuscular performance, an effect that may not be acclimation related.At plasma membrane level, the response to warm-acclimation depended on acclimation temperature.  Acclimation to 15°C induced a significant increase in the S/U fatty acids ratio of PC and PE, but no increase in plasma membrane order.  Acclimation to 22°C induced a significant increase in the Ch/PL molar ratio and in plasma membrane order, but no major changes in overall fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids, compared to cold-acclimated crabs.A seasonal background, determined by complex factors, underlied these responses to temperature-acclimation.  At all acclimation temperatures, crabs acclimated in autumn and winter had lower S/U fatty acid ratios and Ch/PL molar ratios than in spring, and the temperature dependence of plasma membrane fluidity was reduced in summer, compared to spring and autumn.  The response to 15°C-acclimation was greater in winter than in other seasons.  (DX190374)

T1  - The antinociceptive effect of neuropeptide FF in golden-mantled ground squirrels (Citellus lateralis)
AN  - 304299624
AB  - Although the administration of morphine is a frequent treatment for the alleviation of pain, chronic high exposure to morphine may lead to tolerance to the analgesic effect and physical dependence on the narcotic. Neuropeptide FF (NPFF), an endogenous mammalian neuropeptide, has been implicated in the development of tolerance and dependence due to its reported anti-opioid properties.    To explore the role of NPFF within the central nervous system, five doses of NPFF were infused over a 5-day period, into the right lateral ventricle of Citellus lateralis. Nociception was tested by recording the skin-twitch response of each animal to a radiant heat source each day of infusion.    All doses of NPFF resulted in significant antinociception. During experimentation, NPFF-infused animals also showed abstinence-like signs.    Chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of NPFF may cause a compensatory response, leading to an increase in the activity and release of the endogenous opioids.

T1  - Cold tolerance and thermal acclimation of juvenile blue tilapia, Tilapia aurea
AN  - 304281717
AB  - Cold resistance of blue tilapia (Tilapia aurea) was measured as the first step in development of a simulation model to predict acclimation state and mortality of tilapia exposed to varying low temperature. The model is based on F.E.J. Fry's "lethal dose" concept: Total lethal dose is the sum of accumulated incremental doses defined by the ratio $\Delta$t/t$\sb{\rm r}$, where $\Delta$t and t$\sb{\rm r}$ are, respectively, exposure time and expected resistance time at a given lethal temperature. Fifty percent mortality is predicted if and when total dose equals one.    Cold-resistance times were determined for tilapia acclimated to 16, 20 or 24$\sp\circ$C and exposed to lethally low temperatures ranging from 6 to 12$\sp\circ$C. The data then were used to parameterize a linear regression equation describing resistance time as a function of ambient and acclimation temperatures.    In the next stage of the study, acclimation rate was determined for blue tilapia transferred between 16$\sp\circ$C and 24$\sp\circ$C and between 24$\sp\circ$C and 32$\sp\circ$C. Resistance time at criterion temperatures of 6$\sp\circ$C and 10$\sp\circ$C was used to measure the progress of acclimation. These data were incorporated in a predictive equation for acclimation temperature. Resistance time was calculated from the regression equation and was used to predict accumulated lethal dose. The model gave accurate predictions for step-changes in temperature below the LILT (lower incipient lethal temperature) and reasonable predictions when cooling started above LILT. However, the model consistently underestimated resistance time when temperature fluctuated above and below LILT. The addition of a component to allow recovery from cold damage could improve model predictions. At this time, no data exist on which to base such a component.    Muscle lipids of blue tilapia also were measured at three acclimation temperatures and during changes in acclimation to determine if this subtropical species displays the same thermal characteristics as temperate species. The ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine (PC:PE) was lower at low acclimation temperatures, which is consistent with observations on temperate species. PC:PE ratio during thermal acclimation was variable, and no clear pattern was observed. Blue tilapia also displayed, in muscle polar lipids, the ability to reduce saturated fatty acids and increase polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially 22:5n-3, at low temperatures, also consistent with temperate species.

T1  - Adaptations to temperature in fish: Salmonids, centrarchids and percids
AN  - 304254601
AB  - Temperature behaves as a lethal, controlling, limiting, masking or directive factor at the organismal level of fish as ectotherms. The literature contains broad notions of patterns of fish adaptation to temperature based on the informed judgement of experts; these together with two new concepts are taken here as hypotheses to be tested with reliable data sets from a number of species within each of three families: Salmonidae, Percidae and Centrarchidae.    Two versions of the Arrhenius model are applied to describe various steady state rate processes to temperature of fish as ectotherms. The rationale for the selection is based on their: theoretical background in thermodynamics; widespread use in biochemical, developmental and physiological studies; and the statistical significance of the fit to data as evaluated in a comparative study within a group of available models.    Based on rate-type data sets processed with the Arrhenius models and data sets of temperature preferences and resistances, the patterns of adaptation of physiological rates, behavioral activities, and survival thresholds with respect to temperature are inferred at the level of species and families employing graphical and statistical tools.    Thermodynamic principles are exploited conceptually to generate a paradigm for fish species in analogy with an open, self-organizing system. This paradigm is based on a modified maximum power principle and characterized by an optimum operating point and a dissipative auto-catalytic reaction.    To recapitulate, both the special details and broad generalities of various quantitative features in the patterns of adaptation by fish to temperature are explored further in this work than in any previous work. To do so, considerations that are often left implicit in the literature have been made explicit. Also more emphasis has been placed on statistical rigour. Various partial generalizations have been tested and assembled with a more general synthesis which demonstrates that extant inferences and generalizations are broadly complementary and coherent. Some previously published and some new tentative explanations are presented and assessed.

T1  - Behavior, patterns of seasonal field activity and cold tolerance in Bracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)
AN  - 304254154
AB  - Bracon hebetor Say is a cosmopolitanly distributed larval ectoparasitoid of phycitid moths (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Although, many laboratory studies have been conducted on the wasp relatively little is known about its foraging behavior or field biology. Here I report that post-emergence experience influences the response of B. hebetor females to volatiles emanating from the host habitat complex. My results suggest that naive and experienced females differ qualitatively and quantitatively in their behavioral responses to host-associated volatiles. I also found that a host-specific stimulus (silk) is a key factor, in mediating long range foraging by B. hebetor. Finally, the kairomone(s) present on silk was composed of secretions from the mandibular glands.    The seasonal activity and relative abundance of B. hebetor and P. interpunctella was studied in flat storages of shelled corn near Madison, WI. Together B. hebetor and P. interpunctella represented less than 10% of the total insect community at the study site. However, the changes in relative abundance of the parasitoid paralleled the changes in the host population throughout the season. Both parasitoid and host were more abundant during the mid-summer and fall. Trap catches varied among sampling weeks, life stages and trap types. Flight traps (FTs) were more effective for monitoring adult populations of P. interpunctella, whereas Cardboard traps (CBTs) were more effective for monitoring larval populations. In the case of B. hebetor, CBTs consistently captured more females than any other sampling method, whereas FTs captured most of the males. Results from CBTs also suggested that B. hebetor females track the increase of the host through the season. Temperature and host availability are the main factors affecting B. hebetor populations in grain storages.    A laboratory study was made of the survival of B. hebetor life stages and the effect of low temperatures on life history traits. It was determined that immature stages of B. hebetor do not survive exposure to cold temperatures. Developmental time and adult longevity increased significantly with decreasing temperature. Pupae and adults of B. hebetor are the most cold tolerant life stages, thus, the most likely to survive winter conditions in Wisconsin.

T1  - Ontogeny of bombesin-like and histamine-like innervation in the bullfrog central nervous system and the influence of bombesin on behavioral thermoregulation
AN  - 304243000
AB  - Amphibians rely exclusively on behavioral thermoregulation to maintain body temperature within critical limits which are species and developmental stage-specific. Bombesin (BN) and histamine (HA) are members of a class of neurochemicals that have potent thermoregulatory effects in ectothermic and endothermic vertebrate species and may be involved in behavioral thermoregulation in amphibians. To investigate this possibility we determined, using immunocytochemistry, the ontogeny of BN and HA innervation in the bullfrog brain and spinal cord. In addition, the central effects of intraventricular BN injections on thermoregulatory behaviour was investigated at different stages of bullfrog development.    BN-immunoreactive and HA-immunoreactive neurons and fibers were present in the earliest stage tadpoles examined (Gosner stage 29) and their distribution varied throughout larval development and metamorphosis. BN-immunoreactive perikarya were found only in the preoptic area, posterior thalamic nucleus and in the rostroventral tegmentum of the mesencephalon. HA-immunoreactive perikarya were localized in the dorsal infundibular nucleus of the hypothalamus. It was also demonstrated that BN has potent hypothermic effects in both tadpole and adult bullfrogs. Antagonism of the gastrin releasing peptide-preferring (GRP-P) receptor subtype showed that BN acted centrally at the GRP-P receptor in a dose dependent manner to influence behavioral thermoregulation.    These results show that BN- and HA-immunoreactivities are established early in larval development. This pattern is not consistent with reported changes in thermoregulation and suggests that Bn-like peptides and HA may not be involved in the reported developmental changes in amphibian thermoregulation that occur during metamorphosis. Alternatively, developmental adjustments in thermal habitat selection may be mediated by subtle changes in the receptors for these neurochemicals. However, the finding that BN produced hypothermia in both tadpole and adult bullfrogs, suggested that the receptors are present and fully functional early in the ontogeny of the species.

T1  - Upper and lower temperature tolerances of three freshwater game-fish species exposed to cycling temperatures
AN  - 304234806
AB  - A total of 670 critical thermal maxima (CTMax) and minima (CTMin) were determined for three freshwater fishes acclimated to three constant temperatures and a diel regimen cycling between the lowest and highest acclimation temperatures. In all species temperature tolerance was directly related to acclimation temperature and slopes relating these variables indicate that acclimation temperature has a greater influence on tolerance of low rather than high temperatures. CTMax and CTMin values generated following exposure to 32 days of oscillating temperatures indicate that in general, fishes had temperature tolerance acclimation states consistent with the average temperature and not either the highest or lowest temperature of the diel cycle.

T1  - Genetic and molecular basis of heavy metal tolerance and the heat shock response in the Mediterranean fruit fly: Ceratitis capitata
AN  - 304197574
AB  - The Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), Ceratitis capitata, is a major pest of agricultural commodities world wide. Genetic and molecular studies of heavy metal tolerance and the heat shock response in the Medfly can provide a better understanding of how eukaryotes respond to environmental stresses. Potential uses of heavy metal tolerance and a heat shock gene in biological control programs have also been evaluated.    Three heavy metal tolerant strains were established. Genetic analyses of test crosses between these strains and a nonselected strain suggested different modes of inheritance underlying the heavy metal tolerance trait. An attempt to generate a Y-autosome translocation involving this trait appeared to not be feasible.    PCR products were amplified from the Medfly genome based on conserved domains of a metallothionein gene. Genomic DNA sequences homologous to these PCR products demonstrated coding potential metallothionein proteins, although transcripts homologous to these sequences were not detected in poly(A) selected RNA. This coding potential included a long open reading frame with a potentially cysteine rich region and alignment to mammalian metallothionein proteins.    A heat shock like gene (Cerhsc1) was cloned from the Medfly using PCR. This PCR used heavy metal induced cDNA as a template and a PCR primer designed from a conserved domain of metallothionein proteins. The Cerhsc1 gene shows some structural characteristics of a heat inducible gene including the presence of several heat shock elements and the absence of an intron. The Cerhsc1 gene also exhibits a heat shock response resulting in a 10 to 20% increase in the level of transcription.    Developmentally, expression of the Cerhsc1 gene is very abundant in the adult stage, less so in the pupal stage and not detectable in the embryo stages. Overall, the Cerhsc1 gene exhibits structural and functional similarities to both heat inducible and non-heat inducible genes from a wide range of organisms.

T1  - Bioenergetic studies of hyperthermophilic and extremely thermoacidophilic Archea as related to coal desulfurization
AN  - 304196792
AB  - The metabolic variety among organisms belonging to the recently identified, third kingdom of life, the Archaea offers a large genetic pool from which new and improved biocatalytic options are arising. The objective of this thesis was to obtain and apply knowledge of hyperthermophile and thermoacidophile physiology to develop and optimize bioprocesses for coal desulfurization. Evaluations of cellular energetics and environmental factors such as temperature, pH and nutrients which affect biotransformations were performed. Efforts in understanding the biological limitations of these and other thermophile-based biotransformations systems may stand as precedents for the characterization of whole-cell biocatalytic systems for numerous applications.    Evaluation of sulfur metabolism in Pyrococcus furiosus led to the development of a cola bioprocess which removes elemental sulfur from refuse coal. Rates of sulfur removal (1% reduction in coal sulfur in 4 hours at 98$\sp\circ {\rm C}$) were faster than reported mesophile based desulfurizations. However, the biological specificity for polysulfide limited the utility of the system to waste coals. That same specificity for polysulfide made P. furiosus a suitable coal-sulfur speciation tool. Sulfide, detected at nanomolar levels in a P. furiosus bioassay, showed that elemental sulfur is formed as an intermediate of mild oxidations of inorganic sulfur in coal. Further, the bioassay illuminated the need for distinction between polysulfidic and carbon-bound organic sulfur in coal.    To address the issue of removing inorganic sulfur from coal, the extremely thermoacidophilic archaeum Metallosphaera sedula was studied. Careful evaluation of M. sedula's pyrite leaching rates, with consideration of iron/sulfur chemistries, physiology and bioenergerics was performed. Operation of a dual limited continuous culture (at a dilution rate of 0.05 hr$\sp{-1}$) enabled the characterization of mixotrophic growth patterns in M. Sedula. In addition, the proton motive force was measured, testing the chemiosmotic framework as a method of following energetic driving forces to understand cellular survival and to possibly improve upon metals turnover. The proton motive force for M. sedula energizes with casamino acids (0.02 g/l) and ferrous sulfate (0.05 g/l) was -175 to -190 mV with a positive inside potential of 25 mV and an internal pH of 5.0 to 5.2. These measurements varied less than 10% within 4 hours of incubation.    The responses of M. sedula to nutritional and thermal stresses (i.e., the expression of stress response proteins, and changes in proton motive force) were identified. Through Western Blot analysis, several heat shock proteins and one protein expressed during starvation were found to be immunologically related to a molecular chaperone of Sulfolobus shibatae. In addition, during extended incubation at elevated temperatures (80 $\sp\circ {\rm C}$ and 85$\sp\circ {\rm C}$) the intracellular pH declined accompanied by the cessation of leaching activity. Cells incubated at 80$\sp\circ {\rm C}$ and returned to 70$\sp \circ {\it C}$ resumed iron turnover and returned the intracellular pH to near normal levels. Finally, the heat shock of M. sedula under the short term temperature shift was found to increase pyrite dissolution through the synergistic affects of elevated abiotic Fe$\sp{2+}$ release and enhanced biological Fe$\sp{2+}$ oxidation.

T1  - Factors limiting the distribution of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, in Ontario, Canada
AN  - 304191874
AB  - The impact of habitat type, microclimatological parameters and density of host populations on the density of I. scapularis populations was evaluated within four habitats on Long Point from 1990-1992. Based on drag sampling and examination of hosts, I. scapularis was most abundant within the maple forest $>$ oak savannah $>$ white pine $>$ cottonwood dune habitat. Seasonal variation in vapour pressure deficits and habitat utilization by white-tailed deer were responsible for differences in abundance of I. scapularis among habitats.    Under laboratory conditions, the rate of development of all instars of I. scapularis was dependent on temperature. The duration of the pre-oviposition and pre-eclosion periods were significantly correlated with incubation temperature of females $\rm (r\sp2=0.93)$ and eggs $\rm (r\sp2=0.98),$ respectively. Thermal thresholds for oviposition and larval emergence were $2.3\sp\circ$ and $9.2\sp\circ\rm C,$ respectively. Fed larvae moulted when held at ${>}12\sp\circ\rm C,$ whereas nymphs required temperatures ${>}16\sp\circ\rm C$ to moult.    From November 1989 to April 1993, the various instars of I. scapularis were maintained in containers within the four habitats on Long Point to evaluate the effects of habitat on tick development and survival. Based on observations on captive I. scapularis, the life cycle of this tick on Long Point is completed in three or four years.    To test the hypothesis that distribution of I. scapularis is limited by cold climatic extremes, I. scapularis were held in containers within four habitats on Long Point and at three more northern localities from December 1991 until May 1993. Low seasonal degree-day accumulations and poor overwintering survival of eggs, combined with incremental mortality at each instar, difficulty in finding a mate, and low density of hosts, may mitigate against establishment of I. scapularis by introduction of individual ticks into certain northern regions of Ontario.    Borrelia burgdorferi infectivity in experimentally and naturally infected white-footed mice was of short duration suggesting that overwintered I. scapularis larvae and nymphs may have to feed upon infected hosts at the same time of year, in order for a cycle of B. burgdorferi infection to be maintained on Long Point. Likewise, infected I. scapularis nymphs, rather than persistently infected vertebrate hosts, likely serve as the overwintering reservoir for B. burgdorferi.

T1  - Coexistence strategies and hybridization of Galerucella calmarienses and Galerucella pusilla (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), biological control agents of purple loosestrife, Lythrum salicaria
AN  - 304191822
AB  - Comparative studies on the biology and behavior of Galerucella calmariensis L. and G. pusilla Duftschmidt were conducted to elucidate their strategies for coexistence on purple loosestrife, Lythrum salicaria L. Under constant temperatures, developmental time decreased three-fold from 15 to 30$\sp\circ$C for both species, and G. calmariensis (thermal constant, K = 334 degree days; lower thermal threshold, t = 9.8$\sp\circ$C) developed significantly faster than G. pusilla (K = 364; t = 9.4). Survivorship of the developmental stages was also significantly higher in G. calmariensis at lower temperatures (15-25$\sp\circ$C) but no significant difference was observed at high temperatures (27.5-30$\sp\circ$C). Fecundity was highest at 25$\sp\circ$C with a mean of 1,894 $\pm$ 531.2 eggs per female G. calmariensis and 1,619 $\pm$ 463.6 eggs per female G. pusilla. Total eggs and eggs laid per day for G. calmariensis were significantly higher at all temperatures tested, but female longevity and duration of the oviposition period were significantly shorter compared to G. pusilla. Galerucella calmariensis may be more successful at higher latitudes because of its better tolerance to low temperatures compared to G. pusilla.    Resource partitioning between the two species of Galerucella was observed in terms of larval feeding sites and oviposition sites of adults. The preferred feeding site of larval G. calmariensis was on leaves while G. pusilla preferred the leaf buds. Feeding preferences of the two species became more pronounced as the larvae matured. Galerucella calmariensis preferred to oviposit on stems while G. pusilla laid more eggs on buds and leaves. Niche overlap of larval feeding was 79 to 80 percent while oviposition overlap was 59 to 61 percent. Segregation in the feeding and oviposition of G. calmariensis and G. pusilla are behaviors which may favor their coexistence on purple loosestrife without competitive exclusion.    Hybridization between G. calmariensis and G. pusilla was possible under laboratory conditions, but fitness of the F1 hybrids was reduced considerably in terms of the number of females producing viable eggs, egg hatchability and survival of larval progeny to the adult. Production of hybrids in nature is not ruled out, but is unlikely because hybrid breakdown would prevent gene flow. Sexual isolation between the two species occurs as well; males mated only with conspecific females when given a choice.

T1  - Thermal and photoacclimation of photosynthesis in brown algae
AN  - 304187663
AB  - Aspects of thermal and photoacclimation of photosynthesis were investigated in brown macroalgae. The species studied were: Laminaria digitata, which inhabits the upper sublittoral fringe, low-shore rock pools and shallow subtidal areas; Laminaria saccharina, which occurs subtidally in moderately wave-exposed habitats; Fucus evanescens, which occupies the lowest region of the fucoid zone; and Fucus distichus, which typically inhabits shallow rock pools on the upper shore in the Northwest Atlantic. L. saccharina, F. evanescens and F. distichus were used in laboratory culture experiments under controlled conditions, while a population of L. digitata was observed in the field. All species exhibited thermal acclimation of photosynthetic metabolism.    Laboratory culture studies using L. saccharina indicate that a general similarity exists between thermal acclimation to high temperature and photoacclimation to low light, but important differences do occur. Aspects of light-limited photosynthesis (e.g., P$\sb{\rm sub-sat},$ quantum yield, concentrations of major light-harvesting pigments and PSII reaction center densities) increased in algae grown at high temperature or in low light. Hence, they may be regulated by the same physiological mechanism (i.e., the redox state of the plastoquinone pool). However, rates of light-saturated photosynthesis (P$\sb{\rm max})$ and Rubisco content were only affected by temperature, while PSI reaction center densities only varied with light intensity.    Growth of fucoid embryos was light-independent during the first 7-10 d after fertilization and embryos grown at high temperature were significantly larger than those grown at low temperature. Growth and photosynthetic performance were uncoupled during the early development of Fucus and acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus occurred independently of growth. Embryos grown under different temperature/light regimes exhibited similar rates of light-limited photosynthesis, when measured at growth temperatures, that were attributed to changes in quantum yield and dark respiration. Respiratory metabolism exhibited a "classic" photoacclimation response, increasing at high light intensity. However, other aspects of photosynthetic metabolism did not respond to growth conditions as expected from previous studies of acclimation in adult forms. For example, low-temperature grown embryos contained high amounts of Rubisco, but exhibited low rates of P$\sb{\rm max}$ relative to high-temperature grown embryos. Fluorescence induction kinetics suggest that Rubisco may not limit photosynthesis and that embryos grown under low-temperature/high-light conditions may have suffered photodamage.    Seasonal changes in photosynthetic metabolism in a natural population of L. digitata suggest that although thermal acclimation occurred, in contrast to laboratory studies with L. saccharina, it did not confer perfect compensation. Photosynthetic rates were highest in early spring and lowest in summer. This was attributed to the effect of nutrient availability, which appeared to mediate photosynthetic responses to temperature and light. Relative growth rate exhibited maxima in April and December, 1991 and again in March, 1992. Minimal growth occurred in summer and mid-winter, when algae were nitrogen-limited and light-limited respectively. Both growth and photosynthesis changed in phase with ambient and cellular nitrogen levels, except in January and February, 1992. Presumably, photosynthesis, and hence, growth were light-limited during winter months, because L. digitata clearly displays the ability to achieve high rates of metabolism at low temperatures. These data suggest that nitrogen is the most important factor regulating algal productivity in the field. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Sorption, diffusion, and immobilization of volatile organic compounds in soil
AN  - 304174889
AB  - Part I of this dissertation focuses on the testing and development of volatile organic compound (VOC) immobilization technologies for VOC-contaminated soils. VOC immobilization technologies involve the use of sorbents, such as activated carbon or rice hull ash, to improve VOC sorption strength to the waste matrix and encapsulation materials, such as cement or sodium silicate, to prevent VOC leaching and emissions. We found that the cement-based immobilization process, actually in use by several environmental companies, immobilizes volatile organics to a very limited extent. Aside from testing VOC immobilization in existing technologies, the development of a potential new technology to immobilize VOCs is a by-product of our research. This involves the utilization of shredded tire particles as the sorbent material and sodium silicate as the encapsulation agent.    Part II addresses fundamental questions on sorption and diffusion mechanisms of VOCs in soil agglomerates. We emphasize the VOC kinetics of both sorption and desorption rates in dry soil agglomerates under isothermal conditions. Unlike reports of fast VOC sorption rates in soils, we found very slow sorption and desorption rates with experiments lasting days to weeks. The main contributions of this part of the dissertation are to show: (i) slow sorption and desorption rates due to slow diffusion in micropores, (ii) the contribution of mineral surfaces and soil organic matter on the sorption mechanism, (iii) the effect of nonlinear isotherms and the factors leading to asymmetry of sorption and desorption curves, (iv) the necessity of achieving sorption equilibrium to describe the VOC sorption and desorption kinetic behavior in soil and to accurately measure diffusivities, and (v) the need for two- and three-equation diffusion models to describe the sorption and desorption history curves for VOCs in soil and clay minerals. The findings in this section of the investigation are relevant to the development of soil remediation technologies, such as vacuum extraction, passive volatilization, soil aeration, and thermal desorption.

T1  - Interspecific Competition, Predation, and the Coexistence of Three Closely Related Neotropical Armoured Catfishes (Siluriformes - Callichthyidae)
AN  - 2479803663
AB  - Tropical ecosystems are renowned for their high biodiversity with many closely related species living together. Alpha diversity of tropical freshwater fishes is also extremely high, as exemplified by the cichlid fauna of the Great African lakes and the neotropical characins. Since Hutchinson in 1959 posed his often quoted question: "Why are there so many animals?", factors affecting species diversity have been important subject of study and discussion in ecology. Given the limits of the physical environment, two different biological processes are probably responsible for most of the organization of equilibrial communities: competition and predation.Critics of the view that competition and predation play a major role in structuring communities argued that several factors keep populations below a level where competition or predation could be strong. Reviews of the literature on field experiments designed to demonstrate the influence of competition and predation revealed that only 9% of the studies were conducted in the tropics.The tropical rainforest is one of the most stable environments in the world. Temperature and humidity are almost constant, but important fluctuations in the water level of streams and swamps occur. Extreme conditions limiting population densities and leading to the extinction of populations are often hard to imagine. The high number of species will lead to complex biological interactions. More studies on competition and predation in the stable environment of the tropical rainforest are necessary to evaluate the importance of both processes in structuring communities.A case study is presented concerning three medium-sized armoured catfishes of the family Callichthyidae: Callichthys callichthys, Hoplosternum littorale and Hoplosternum thoracatum. In order to evaluate the influence of competition and predation on the catfish communities, four factors were investigated in detail: 1) geographical distribution, 2) diet overlap, 3) reproductive seasonality and nest-site differentiation, and 4) predation.In Suriname (South America), both C. callichthys and H. thoracatum occur all over the country. Both catfishes are abundant in both coastal plain swamps with standing water and rainforest creeks in the interior with running water. Hoplosternum littorale, on the other hand, is restricted in its distribution to coastal plain swamps. Salinity tolerance experiments demonstrated that one-week old larvae of H. littorale could not survive in electrolyte-poor water (e.g. rain water). The 'clear water' of rainforest creeks in the interior may be compared to slightly contaminated distilled water with very low electric conductivity. Larvae of both C. callichthys and H. thoracatum survived and developed further in rain water. The pattern of distribution in Suriname can be considered as a model of the distribution of the three catfishes in South America. In South America, H. littorale is not only conspicuously absent from clear water streams draining the weathered Precambrium Guyana and Brazilian Shields, but also from 'black water' streams with humic acids and also a low conductivity (e.g. the Rio Negro). Within the Amazon drainage system H. littorale seems restricted to 'white water' streams loaded with Andean sediments and with a higher conductivity than both clear water and black water. In Suriname, actual syntopy of the three species occurs in coastal plain swamps. In rainforest creeks of the interior C. callichthys and H. thoracatum occur syntopically. Consequently interspecific competition among the three callichthyids is possible.Analysis of the stomach contents of larvae, juveniles and adults of the three armoured catfishes revealed no significant interspecific differences in the diet of larvae, juveniles and adults. However, ontogenetic differences in diet composition among larvae, juveniles and adults where significant for all three catfishes. Larvae of C . callichthys, H. littorale and H. thoracatum fed almost exclusively on Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda. The stomach contents of juveniles were more diverse and included micro-crustacea, insect larvae, aquatic insects and some detritus. Adults ingested large quantities of detritus which probably reflected the inability of large fish to seperate effectively benthic invertebrates from substrate. Chironomid larvae where found in large numbers in the stomach of adult specimens. The short alimentary tract of the three catfishes and the structure of its wall make it improbable that these fishes are able to assimilate detrital nonprotein amino acids. The posterior part of the intestine is thin-walIed and has a respiratory function. The anterior digestive portion is relatively short. Morphologically the three callichthyids are adapted to a benthic way of life and a diet of soft-bodied aquatic invertebrates. The similarity in the diet and their bottomdwelling habit provide the basis for grouping the three armoured catfishes into one ecological guild. Competitive interactions are expected to be potentially strong among members of a guild.Male C. callichthys, H. littorale and H. thoracatum construct and guard a floating bubble nest in flooded swamps. Although the habit of constructing a floating bubble nest probably evolved as an adaptation to the oxygen-depleted environment of tropical standing waters, some of the characteristics of the nests of C.callichthys and H. thoracatum may have evolved as a response to the unpredictability of the fluctuations in water level and water velocity in rainforest creeks. The conspicuous nests allow the study of the temporal pattern of breeding, the spatial distribution of the nests and the differentiation of the nest-site microhabitat among the three species. Daily surveys in coastal plain swamps revealed a similar, bimodal breeding season in the three catfishes. Nests were observed in both the short and long rainy season. The bimodal breeding pattern in Suriname is probably related to the unreliability of the rainfall in the short rainy season of December-January. In French Guiana the rains of December-January usually do not fail and an unimodal breeding season of H. littorale is found. Significant differences in nest macrohabitat selection were found among the three callichthyids. Nests of H. littorale were built in herbaceous swamps, while C . callichthys and H. thoracatum nested in swamp forest under trees. The two forest nesting species differed in the microhabitat at the nest site. Nests of C . callichthys were constructed in extremely shallow water and in holes of tree roots and earth. Nest densities in the selected habitat were low in C.callichthys and H. littorale, but relatively high in H . thoracatum. Nest-site differentiation in the rainy season (the main feeding period) may prevent competitive exclusion among the three catfishes.The potential predation pressure on eggs, larvae and juveniles of H. thoracatum was estimated by combining laboratory predation rates of 24 predator species (both invertebrates and vertebrates) with the density of the predators in the swamp as determined by chemofishing with rotenone. The contribution of a particular predator species to the total predation pressure on H.thoracatum was determined to a large extent by the density of the predator in the swamp. Seemingly innocuous predators with low or moderate predation rates in the laboratory may be extremely important in the swamp due to their abundance. Smallsized fishes and aquatic invertebrates are probably major predators of early developmental stages of H. thoracatum. The potential predation pressure on eggs is high, but the aggressive nest guarding behaviour of the male catfish and concealment of the nests probably protects the eggs effectively from most aquatic predators. Larvae are not guarded by the male and the potential impact of the 24 predators on the larvae of H. thoracatum is large. Although the experiments were performed with H. thoracatum there is no good reason to expect important differences in predation rates on larvae of the three armoured catfishes. Even if only 2.5 % of the potential predation will be realized due to other prey available, the high mortality of early developmental stages of H. thoracatum (and C. callichthys and H. littorale ) in the swamp could be easily explained as the effect of predation. Potential predation pressure and the number of predators that were able to prey on H. thoracatum sharply declined with increasing age (size) of the juvenile catfish. The heavy armour of bony plates and stout pectoral spines protect older juveniles and adults from most potential predators. The high potential predation pressure in the swamps and the low density of juvenile catfish at the end of the rainy season suggest that predation is important in structuring these catfish communities.Although larvae of the three armoured catfishes C. callichthys , H. littorale and H. thoracatum show differences in tolerance to electrolyte-poor water, the three species occur together in coastal swamps. Interspecific diet overlap is very high, and the three catfishes show no differentiation in their breeding season and diel pattern of activity. Ontogenetic changes in the defense mechanisms of armoured catfishes result in a situation in which both predation and competition exert control at different times in the life cycle. Predators probably kill most of the larvae and juveniles, leaving only a few individuals to escape and reach adulthood. If the number of escapes would exceed the number of adult deaths, the populations eventually become sufficiently dense to compete. However, in this situation nest-habitat segregation may prevent competitive exclusion of one  of the three species .

T1  - Thermal response and tolerance in the introduced freshwater bivalve, Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel)
AN  - 230997454
AB  - Nonindigenous zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, are dispersing into southern U.S. freshwaters. Investigation of thermal adaptations permitting their penetration into southern U.S. waters allowed reassessment of this species' thermal tolerance limits and eventual North American distribution. Mussels did not move toward preferred temperatures in laboratory thermal gradients, suggesting lack of behavioral thermoregulation. Thermal tolerance times on exposure to a lethal temperature (33$\sp\circ$C) provided evidence that lower Mississippi River mussels were genetically more tolerant than northern, Niagara River mussels and that tolerance times were dependent on laboratory temperature acclimation and field seasonal acclimatization. Mussels were relatively tolerant of daily temperature fluctuations above and below their upper thermal limits typical of southern U.S. drainages. Selection for thermally tolerant races, seasonal temperature acclimatization and tolerance of daily temperature fluctuation above lethal limits will allow deeper zebra mussel penetration of southern U.S. drainages than previously predicted.

T1  - A study of the physicochemical limnology of Athens Reservoir, Henderson County, Texas and the relationship the water quality has with the Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center
AN  - 230868567
AB  - A twelve month investigation of the physicochemical limnology of Athens Reservoir was conducted from October 1993 to September 1994. Twenty-nine physical and chemical parameters were analyzed to determine the water quality. Athens Reservoir is the drinking water source for the city of Athens, Texas and monitoring of this source is crucial to the treatment of the drinking water. The major objective, however, was to determine how the water quality will affect the fish in the hatcheries at the Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center adjacent to the reservoir. Certain parameters are considered important in fish production, and all of these parameters that were analyzed revealed no potentially detrimental effects to the raising of fish. Thermal stratification was the major ecological phenomenon that occurred, and this process affected several parameters. These parameters were not affected to a point where limnologists or hatchery officials need to become overly concerned. Dissolved oxygen concentrations did fall below EPA standards and will have to be monitored in terms of fish aquaculture. Both orthophosphate and total phosphorus concentrations exceeded the EPA standards to control eutrophication. Athens Reservoir, however, is not in a state of accelerated eutrophication because the reservoir is probably nitrogen limited. Also, phytoplankton primary productivity, based on biomass density, did not reflect increased eutrophication. Overall, the reservoir demonstrated characteristics associated with mesotrophy.

T1  - Effects of copper on the acorn barnacle Elminius modestus (Darwin) (Cirripedia:Thoracica)
AN  - 2033735965
AB  - The acorn barnacle Elminius modestus (Darwin) was shown to be an excellent organism in which to study the effects of pollution throughout the life cycle. Effects of copper were demonstrated on both larval and adult forms at acute, chronic and physiological levels. Acute effects of copper on E. modestus nauplii were shown through acute toxicity tests (100 ppb-500 ppb). The test procedure was standardised and subsequently used to identify the effects of various factors on copper toxicity. Rises in temperature from 12.5 degrees C to 22.5 degrees C increased copper toxicity to the nauplii. Parental maintenance could affect naupliar tolerance to copper. The organic content of seawater reduced copper toxicity to the nauplii. The tolerance of nauplii from the copper-contaminated Dulas Bay had a genetic origin. The complex interactions between food, feeding behaviour and copper toxicity were investigated throughout the development of E. modestus larvae. The major findings pinpointed nutritional stress as the main factor that influenced the action of dissolved copper. In the laboratory, chronic effects on adult E. modestus barnacles were evidenced through reduced survivorship, growth and reproductive effort in a population exposed to 50 ppb copper for more than four months. Exposure of E. modestus adults to 20 ppb copper reduced feeding rates and altered feeding behaviour. Further physiological effects of copper were demonstrated on E. modestus nauplii through variations in oxygen consumption. At 16 degrees C, nauplii exposed to 50 ppb had higher respiration rates than control nauplii. The oxygen consumption of nauplii at higher concentrations was equivalent to that of uncontaminated nauplii. The result is interpreted as evidence that regulation (copper sequestration) incurs an energetic cost.

T1  - Effects of Copper on the Acorn Barnacle <em>Elminius modestus</em> (Darwin) (Cirripedia:Thoracica)
AN  - 1779210645
AB  - The acorn barnacle Elminius modestus (Darwin) was shown to be an excellent organism in which to study the effects of pollution throughout the life cycle. Effects of copper were demonstrated on both larval and adult forms at acute, chronic and physiological levels. Acute effects of copper on E. modestus nauplii were shown through acute toxicity tests (100 ppb-500 ppb). The test procedure was standardised and subsequently used to identify the effects of various factors on copper toxicity. Rises in temperature from 12.5&deg;C to 22.5&deg;C increased copper toxicity to the nauplii. Parental maintenance could affect naupliar tolerance to copper. The organic content of seawater reduced copper toxicity to the nauplii. The tolerance of nauplii from the copper-contaminated Dulas Bay had a genetic origin. The complex interactions between food, feeding behaviour and copper toxicity were investigated throughout the development of E. modestus larvae. The major findings pinpointed 'nutritional stress' as the main factor that influenced the action of dissolved copper. In the laboratory, chronic effects on adult E. modestus barnacles were evidenced through reduced survivorship, growth and reproductive effort in a population exposed to 50 ppb copper for more than four months. Exposure of E. modestus adults to 20 ppb copper reduced feeding rates and altered feeding behaviour. Further physiological effects of copper were demonstrated on E. modestus nauplii through variations in oxygen consumption. At 16&deg;C, nauplii exposed to 50 ppb had higher respiration rates than 'control' nauplii. The oxygen consumption of nauplii at higher concentrations was equivalent to that of uncontaminated nauplii. The result is interpreted as evidence that regulation (copper sequestration) incurs an energetic cost.

T1  - Energetics and cooling in urban parks
AN  - 304183511
AB  - While there has been a long tradition for the integration of architecture and landscape to improve the urban environment, little is known about the effect of urban parks on local climate. In this study the park effect is determined through an integrated research approach incorporating field measurements of the thermal regime and energetics of urban parks, together with scale modelling of nocturnal cooling in urban parks.    The research is limited to consideration of the park effect in two cities with different summer climates: Sacramento, California (hot summer Mediterranean) and Vancoucer, British Columbia (cool summer Mediterranean). In both these cities, surveys of summer-time air temperature patterns associated with urban parks confirm and extend previous findings. In temperate Vancouver, the park effect is typically 1-2$\sp\circ$C, rarely more than 3$\sp\circ$C, although it can be higher under ideal conditions. However, in a hot, dry city, the effect is considerably enhanced with parks as much as 5-7$\sp\circ$C cooler than their urban surrounds.    A comparison of the surface energy balance of small open, grassed parks in these two cities demonstrated the importance of evapotranspiration in park energetics. In hot, dry Sacramento, evaporation in the park was advectively-assisted and exceeded that at an irrigated rural site. Strong advective edge effects on evaporation were observed in this wet park. These decayed approximately exponentially with distance into the park. The urban park in Vancouver was moist, but unirrigated. While evaporation dominated the surface energy balance, the sensible heat flux was positive through most of the day, and evaporation was not strongly influenced by advection. The evaporation trend in the park probably reflected the turbulence and soil moisture regimes. However, an irrigated lawn in Vancouver did exhibit edge-type advection. This suggests the soil moisture regime may be critical in determining whether evaporation exceeds the potential rate.    The contribution of processes to nocturnal cooling in urban parks was determined through scale modelling. It showed that surface geometry and the urban-park difference in thermal admittance may be of equal importance in nocturnal cooling. Parks with high sky view factors have increased radiative cooling and if the park is very dry (and therefore has a low thermal admittance), the cooling is furthered enhanced. Evaporative cooling is critical in establishing the park as a "cool island" at sunset, but the presence of moisture slows cooling through the night.    Integration of the field and model data leads to the development of guidelines for planners regarding the design of parks for maximum climatic benefit. The optimum size of the park depends to a large extent, on the geometry of the urban surrounds. To maximize radiative cooling, the width of open park areas should be at least 7.5 times the height of the trees or buildings around the park border. Larger parks increase the size of the volume of air cooled and this increases the potential for advection of cool air into the neighbourhood. It suggested that if cooling is the objective, the optimum design is a savannah-type park with loose clusters of trees interspersed by wide open, irrigated grass. The arrangement of trees must be chosen with great care to allow the advection of air both into, and out of, the park.

T1  - Thelytoky in the Trichogramma minutum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) complex from Zeiraphera canadensis: Occurrence, phenotypic traits and molecular identity
AN  - 304175697
AB  - Individuals of the Trichogramma minutum complex emerging from eggs of Zeiraphera canadensis were found to be predominately thelytokous with only a few being arrhenotokous. Thelytokous individuals were sexually incompatible and could not be converted to arrhenotoky. The two forms were phenotypically distinct: thelytokous parasitoids had a lower threshold temperature, higher degree-days for development, lower fecundity, a higher production of females, slower ovarian development, greater host specificity, and a higher tolerance to cold temperature than arrhenotokous parasitoids. They also exhibited behavioural differences in host recognition and flight activity. Although morphologically identical, these two forms were genetically different and could be distinguished rapidly using isozyme or ribosomal DNA techniques. The results indicate that thelytoky is an ecological adaptation to local host and habitat conditions, and suggest that thelytokous individuals could be used successfully in biocontrol programs.

T1  - Influence of summer heat availability on forest establishment at the treeline near Churchill, Manitoba
AN  - 304162084
AB  - The northern treeline is a forest edge that persists in a thermally-marginal environment. To examine the development and stability of the treeline, I first model the process responsible for the seasonal heat influx into northern latitudes which is the poleward movement of the Arctic Front. The force of poleward propagation of warm tropical air, and thus the subsequent summer heat availability, was accurately predicted by the thermal gradient across the receding Front. At the treeline at Churchill, Manitoba the air mass dynamics caused near-average (subarctic) summers but also distinctly cold (arctic) and warm (boreal) types as well. However, the variation in summer heat availability did not limit flowering, cone development, or seed production in treeline white spruce. Rather reproductive success related to tree vigor and age as indicated by size. Individual wind-abraded trees that form islands and woodlands on the forest-tundra were small while the full-crowned trees that collectively form the forest were much larger. Flower and cone length in different tree populations was similar but large forest trees produced more cones and seeds, and the largest seed. Large seeds had a high viability and germinated the first year after flowering compared to two years later for the smaller forest-tundra seed. Availability of viable seed limited seedling establishment on forest-tundra. Open areas were suitable for germination but some type of ground cover disturbance was required. Disturbed forest patches regenerated at a rate that correlates significantly with summer heat availability during the year when reproductive buds formed. The seedling density of the patch was proportional to the heat availability when the parent forest originally established. Trees which initially had favourable conditions during establishment may, under favourable conditions, produce reproductive buds that produce superior seed which disperse into the patch. I conclude that movement of the treeline depends on three factors: (1) history and status of the parent population which is largely a factor of the past heat availability; (2) conditions during bud formation which are limited by the current heat availability; and (3) probability that viable seed will reach a suitable site for germination.

T1  - Interactive effects of salinity, temperature and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon on the embryonic survival and development of medaka (Oryzias latipes)
AN  - 304145808
AB  - This study investigated whether benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) influences temperature and salinity tolerances of medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos. Embryos were incubated in 0, 1 and 10 ppm B(a)P solutions at different temperatures and salinities. Maximum (100%) hatching success and frequency of normal larvae in the absence of B(a)P occurred at 23 to 30$\sp\circ$C and 0 to 22% salinities. Temperatures $\le$15$\sp\circ$ or $\ge$40$\sp\circ$C were lethal.    Temperature and salinity tolerance ranges generally narrowed with B(a)P concentration. Maximum hatching success and frequency of normal larvae ranges at 0 ppm $>$ 1ppm $>$ 10 ppm B(a)P (90% was the highest normal larvae frequency at 10 ppm, however). Maximum hatching success at 10 ppm B(a)P occurred at 21 to 27$\sp\circ$C, narrower and lower than without B(a)P, and at 0 to 18$\perthous$ salinities, also narrower. Salinity and temperature tolerances, measured by 50% hatching success curves, at 0 ppm $>$ 1ppm, but 10 ppm $>$ 1 ppm B(a)P. For 50% normal larvae, 0 ppm $>$ 1 ppm $>$ 10 ppm. B(a)P at 10 ppm B(a)P had some effect at all temperature/salinity conditions, according to response surfaces, although there was no effect at 1 ppm at 25 to 28$\sp\circ$C and 2 to 20$\perthous$.    Qualitatively similar abnormalities occurred at all B(a)P concentrations. The frequency of individuals with multiple abnormalities was B(a)P concentration-dependent.    Temperature had the greatest effect on incubation length. Median hatching times decreased from 23 to 7 days at 18 to 35$\sp\circ$C, respectively. Onset and median hatching times were delayed up to five days $\ge$35$\perthous$ salinity. B(a)P had no consistent effect on incubation length.    These results suggest that while B(a)P in the environment could have a slight direct effect on medaka, it is more likely to diminish their temperature and salinity tolerances. This limitation could make the difference between surviving or not surviving natural environmental fluctuations. Sublethal effects such as physical abnormalities may further impair survival in nature.

T1  - Development of field analysis for semi-volatile organic compounds by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
AN  - 304140039
AB  - In this thesis, effort has been directed toward developing qualitative direct soil measurements, and more quantitative analysis by performing a simple 2-min soil/organic solvent extraction procedure before thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TDGC/MS) analysis. Research is presented documenting data quality for both the direct soil and soil/solvent extraction procedures. Field-practical water sample preparation methods have also been developed for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) listed acid/base/neutral compounds employing solid phase extraction techniques, viz cyclohexyl and C$\sb{18}$ stationary supports for phenols and the base/neutral compounds, respectively.    The TDGC/MS linear dynamic range for these organic compounds extended over two orders of magnitude. Instrument detection limits for pure standards are between 1 and 31 ng except N-nitrosodiphenylamine (125 ng). Method detection limits for soil and water samples collected from the Fort Devens site were 0.5 ppm and 50 ppb, respectively.    On-site rapid semi-quantitative and quantitative analytical methods for the detection of acid/base/neutral compounds by a field thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometer have been developed and applied to a hazardous waste site investigation at Fort Devens (MA). The study was conducted as part of a data gap and data quality study during an ongoing remedial investigation (RI) conducted by an engineering company (ABB) for the U.S. Army. The field TDGC/MS results compared favorably with commercial laboratory analysis with measurement precision and accuracy better than or equal to laboratory GC/MS analysis. Field TDGC/MS detection limits for "real" samples were routinely lower than the commercial laboratory. Also shown was the fact that major data gaps occurred when workplans and sample collection strategies can not be altered to adapt to actual data produced in the field, resulting in inefficient decision making and more expensive site cleanup costs.

T1  - Genetic, morphological, and ecophysiological variation in geographically restricted and widespread species of Nothofagus from southern South America
AN  - 304121403
AB  - Three species of Nothofagus, the geographically restricted N. nitida (Phil.) Krasser and the widespread N. betuloides (Mirb.) Oerst and N. dombeyi (Mirb.) Oerst which are dominant components of temperate forests in southern South America, were compared using allozyme electrophoresis, leaf morphology, and physiological tolerances to temperature.    N. betuloides and N. dombeyi were more genetically variable than N. nitida. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that widespread species are often associated with historically large and more continuously distributed populations which in turn can maintain higher levels of genetic variation than species with more restricted geographic ranges. In addition, a closer relationship is suggested between N. dombeyi and N. betuloides than either has with N. nitida.    Hierarchical distribution of genetic diversity indicated that more genetic variation was present within than among populations of each species. The detected inbreeding suggests either self-fertilization and/or population substructuring into discrete family groups. Reduced seed vagility and regeneration of natural stands after disturbance by a few remnant individuals would probably generate the recruitment of related seedlings underneath parent trees. High outcrossing rates were estimated from progeny arrays which are consistent with the expectations for woody, presumably highly outcrossed species with wind-borne seed.    Leaf architecture of the three species was analyzed using venation patterns, leaf landmarks, and outlines. The three analyses clearly separated N. nitida from the other two species. However, N. dombeyi and N. betuloides showed a great deal of overlap in terms of their leaf shapes. In addition to differences in shape, the size component of leaf morphology discriminated among the three species.    Photosynthetic performances were compared among the three species in terms of their maximum photosynthetic rates and temperature optima for photosynthesis when grown in temperature regimes of 20 and 5$\sp\circ$C. N. betuloides, the southernmost species, had a lower optimum temperature for photosynthesis as well as higher photosynthetic rates at low temperatures than the northernmost N. dombeyi. The narrowly distributed N. nitida had the most marked capacity for photosynthetic adjustment in terms of shifting its optimum temperature for photosynthesis to the acclimation temperature. Although these data are in agreement with their current geographic distributions, they also suggest that their physiological responses, especially for N. nitida, may indicate adaptation to present and past climatic conditions as well.    The data presented in this study, in concert with information from the fossil record, indicate that these taxa are probably members of a pre-Pleistocene flora and consequently their genetic structures, morphologies, and physiologies reflect a more ancient evolutionary history than previously hypothesized.

T1  - An experimental and modeling study of spouted beds for combustion applications
AN  - 304117634
AB  - Emissions from combustion sources are of environmental concern; consequently, development of novel combustion systems with low pollutant generation is of current interest. This project investigates a spouted bed as an efficient, low emission combustor. Air is used as the oxidizer, propane and toluene are used as the fuels and sand is used as the heterogeneous medium. Efficient recirculation of heat by the bed particles is an unique attraction of spouted beds (SBs), which is a motivation for this work.    To study combustion characteristics, 5 cm and 10 cm diameter reactors with cone and flat bottoms are used. A study of two combustors with different sizes yields scaling parameters for combustor stability and efficiency. Exit concentrations of carbon monoxide, unconverted fuel and hydrocarbon products are used as the indicators of combustor performance. In the operating range of interest, a commonly occurring instability is bed pulsations. Introduction of a draft tube is the most efficient way to overcome this instability. Design parameters such as the inlet, particle & column diameters, cone angle, bed height, etc., influence the pulsating regime. The solids that are circulating in the combustor lower the lean flammability limit by recycling heat; it is found that a spouted bed combustor can be operated at an equivalence ratio as low as 0.44.    The flame located at the top of the annulus, called the annulus-flame, determines the exit emissions. Under stable operating conditions, annulus residence time, equivalence ratio and fines concentration in the bed are the three most important factors that control the overall combustor performance; they affect the efficiency of the annulus flame and thus affect the overall efficiency. The nature and quantity of surface available in the annulus region also influences the product distribution and concentrations emanating from the annulus-flame. The combustion of propane and toluene yields destruction & removal efficiencies $\geq$99.999% and CO $<$ 10 ppm in the spouted bed systems studied here.    A study of the annulus indicates that sand is an active catalytic medium while glass beads are inert, with respect to thermal oxidation reactions. In fact, the oxidation reactions at the sand surface are so fast that the mass transfer of fuel to the surface is the rate-limiting step. However, in the flame region, the particles (sand/glass beads, etc.) have the same effect on the oxidation reactions, irrespective of their nature. A comparison of the fuel conversions in the annulus of the 5 cm and 10 cm combustors indicates a scale-up effect; in the 5 cm combustor, particle diameter does not affect the fuel conversion while it does in the 10 cm combustor. Propylene is the dominant hydrocarbon product of incomplete combustion in the particle-rich region (annulus) while ethylene is the dominant hydrocarbon product in the particle-lean region, i.e., above the bed surface.

T1  - The influence of light on Penaeus vannamei and Penaeus monodon larval production and acclimation to temperature and salinity of postlarval Penaeus vannamei and Penaeus monodon
AN  - 304115704
AB  - Research was conducted to determine the influence of light spectra, intensity, and photoperiod on the final weight, survival, and rate of metamorphosis of larval Penaeus vannamei and P. monodon. Light spectra included red, blue, green, and white. Light intensities were 0.6, 3.4, and 6.8 uE/m$\sp2/$sec. Photoperiods used were 24L:0D, 12:12, and 0:24.    No significant influence was found on final postlarval weight, survival, or rate of metamorphosis in any of the light spectra treatments. There were no significant differences noted between P. vannamei and P. monodon. The postlarval dry weight was significantly lower in the intermediate 12:12 photoperiod as compared to the other two.    Postlarvae aged 1, 5, 10, and 20 days old were challenged at salinities of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and the ambient salinity of 30 ppt, and at temperatures of 24, 28, and 32$\sp\circ$C. There was increasing tolerance to salinity challenges with increasing age. P. vannamei postlarvae had well developed acclimation capabilities at P10, while in P. monodon, this was delayed until P20. There were significant differences between the two species. There was a significant reduction in survival at extreme salinity challenges in both species when coupled with thermal stress at 32$\sp\circ$C.    There was no increase in tolerance to salinity challenge either due to previous acclimation to reduced salinity of 20 ppt, or based on prior acclimation at 24$\sp\circ$C.
