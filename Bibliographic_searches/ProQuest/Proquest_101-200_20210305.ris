T1  - Cross Resistance to Environmental Stressors in Natal Fruit Fly, <em>Ceratitis rosa</em> Karsch (Diptera: Tephritidae) and Its Underlying Physiological Mechanisms
AN  - 2496304446
AB  - Plastic adjustments of physiological tolerance to a particular stressor can result in fitness benefits for resistance that might manifest not only in that same environment, but might also be advantageous when faced with alternative environmental stressors, a phenomenon termed cross-tolerance. The nature and magnitude of cross-tolerance responses can provide important insights into the underlying genetic architecture, potential constraints on, or versatility of, an organism’s stress responses. The current study tested for cross-tolerance to a suite of abiotic factors that likely contribute to setting insect population dynamics and geographic range limits: heat, cold, desiccation and starvation resistance in adult mixed sex Ceratitis rosa following acclimation to all of these isolated individual conditions prior to stress assay. Traits of stress resistance measure included critical thermal (activity) limits, chill coma recovery time (CCRT), heat knockdown time (HKDT), desiccation and starvation resistance. In agreement with a range of other studies, we found that acclimation to one stress typically increased resistance for that same stress experienced later in life. A more novel result is that substantial evidence for cross-tolerance was found. For example, we found an improvement in heat tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTmax) following starvation or desiccation hardening; improved desiccation resistance following cold acclimation, and enhanced starvation resistance following desiccation hardening, indicating pronounced cross tolerance to these environmental stressors for the traits examined. The study further investigated underlying physiological mechanisms to the observed cross tolerance by measuring water balance traits, carbohydrates and lipid content of acclimated and control adult C. rosa. Overlaps in physiological mechanisms such as reduced water loss rates, and high lipid content observed in both heat and starvation treatment C. rosa flies were determined to be the likely mechanisms behind the observed increased heat tolerance following desiccation hardening, and improved heat tolerance following starvation acclimation respectively. However physiological mechanisms were not exhaustive hence there is need to conduct further research to explain all observed cross tolerance. The major implications of the results are:1) the existence of cross tolerance could explain how species are able to survive multiple stress environments, 2) that a set of common underlying physiological mechanisms might exist between apparently divergent stress responses in species, and (3) suggest that stress resistant traits likely coevolved to cope with diverse or simultaneous stressors.

T1  - Biology of <em>Bactrocera dorsalis</em> (Diptera: Tephritidae): Implications on Population Dynamics and Pest Management
AN  - 2496187474
AB  - Fruit production is one of the fastest growing sectors in Botswana. As one of the agricultural sectors, fruit production is very crucial as it contributes immensely towards income generation and employment opportunities, especially for vulnerable rural livelihoods. Despite all the benefits, one of the biggest hurdles in the fruit production industry is disease and insect pests. Chief among these insect pests is the Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Bactrocera dorsalis is a worldwide economic insect pest of fruit and vegetables that has spread its geographical range to many African countries including Botswana. It was first detected in Botswana in 2010 in the Chobe district. However its spread and establishment around the country following its first detection is largely unknown. Furthermore despite this pest being of economic importance and a biosecurity threat, its response to prevailing Botswana microclimates and global change remained unknown. My study therefore investigated (i) presence and (ii) seasonal population dynamics of B. dorsalis in Botswana. Furthermore I investigated the thermal tolerance of B. dorsalis by measuring its different thermal low and high temperature activity traits vis a vis Critical thermal limits (CTLs), Lethal temperature assays (LTAs), and Supercooling points (SCPs), in order to understand how temperature largely impact this specie’s activity and thus population dynamics, abundance and consequently invasive potential. My seasonal monitoring results indicate that B. dorsalis is now established in the Chobe district, (its first area of detection) as shown by its continued presence all year round and high average monthly trap catches (<0.1) as compared to other districts. . Furthermore the insect pest has been detected in other districts south of Botswana, including Kgatleng, Kweneng, South-east, and Southern. This indicated that since 2010, the insect pest has spread down south of the country, with potential negative effects on fruit industries in those areas. Nevertheless, records of this insect pest in some of the areas (South-East and Kgatleng) were erratic, symbolizing that the areas did not have ‘resident breeding populations' for B. dorsalis but rather repeated introductions from ‘endemic’ or highly infested areas. Laboratory thermal activity experiments showed there was an improvement in critical thermal maxima (CTmax) at higher ramping rate across all the two developmental stages, indicating the lack of potential to shift high temperature tolerance for the two developmental stages at short timescales. The average high temperature of activity (CTmax) for adults and larvae were 46.16°C and 45.23°C respectively. However, there was an improved critical thermal minimum (CTmin) for larvae at slower ramping rate, indicating potential to improve low thermal tolerance at slower ramping rates, otherwise termed rapid cold hardening, the average low temperature for activity (CTmin) for adults and larvae 9.10°C and 7.3°C respectively. The results for lower- and upper lethal temperature assays (LLTs and ULTs respectively) revealed a reduction is survival at all the developmental stages as severity and duration increased, affirming the notion mortality is a function of temperature duration and severity. The ULTs and LLTs for adults, larvae and pupae ranged from 39-45, -6– 4°C; 38-41, - 4–2°C and 39-45, -8–4°C respectively at 0.5 to 4hrs treatments. Pupae were the most temperature tolerant compared to other mobile stages. The SCPs of B. dorsalis developmental stages were -16.5 (adults), -16.6 (pupae) and -12.18˚C (larvae). SCP’s were significantly affected by developmental stages with pupae and adults having relatively depressed SCPs compared to larvae. General microclimatic temperatures recorded here versus experimentally derived thermal limits to activity imply that both high and low temperatures may not limit B. dorsalis establishment in the short term, and that the species may thrive upon introduction to the thermal environments investigated. The results of this study are of major implications to the management and enforcement of quarantine regulations of B. dorsalis. Knowledge of thermal biology is highly critical in the development of phytosanitary measures as well as in the forecasting of its ability to spread and establish in novel areas. This data may help in the development of mechanistic models of B. dorsalis invasion potential.

T1  - Reproduction and larval ecology of the toheroa, Paphies ventricosa, from Oreti Beach, Southland, New Zealand
AN  - 2312804848
AB  - Paphies ventricosa is a large surf clam endemic to New Zealand with a patchy distribution and whose populations have substantially declined during the past century owing to overfishing and habitat degradation. Poor recruitment is now evident, and therefore, understanding the larval recruitment of P. ventricosa is key to developing and implementing conservation strategies for the species. In order to identify factors driving larval recruitment in toheroa, Paphies ventricosa, from Oreti Beach, Southland, New Zealand, the southernmost known extent of the species, various studies were carried out from 2011 to 2014 in the field and the laboratory In 2011, the reproductive cycle of P. ventricosa was examined over one year in a population at Oreti Beach. In 2012, the spatial variation in reproduction among four sites along Oreti Beach, including the site from 2011, was quantified from body indices and the histological examination of gonads. Based on changes in oocyte size, gametogenic stage and condition index, we observed a species with a primary spawning in spring and a second spawning event in late summer/autumn, with no resting phase but minimal reproductive activity over winter. Seasonal reproduction corresponded with warmer sea surface temperature and a peak in chlorophyll-a concentrations in the region. Small-scale (less than 15 km) variation in the timing of spawning was also evident along Oreti Beach, with a degree of asynchrony that could affect fertilisation success in the population. These patterns may be an important consideration when identifying areas that may be considered for conserving source populations. Using scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy, fertilisation, and embryonic and larval development were observed at three culturing temperatures (12, 16 and 20 C). Larval shape was not temperature dependent, suggesting that the smaller larvae found at colder temperatures reflect a slowing of larval development, rather than physiological damage by temperature resulting in abnormal larval development. The temperature thermal tolerance of fertilisation and early larval development in Paphies ventricosa was examined to understand the role of temperature in early larval recruitment success. There was a significant effect of temperature on the fertilisation success which ranged from 4.6% to 46.7%. Fertilisation was greaater than 30% successful between 16.0 and 21.0 C, and was successful beyond the natural temperature range of the species. P. ventricosa larva were tolerant to temperatures beyond the naturally occurring temperatures during spawning/development periods, but were most successful around 15 C. While temperature is important in the recruitment of marine invertebrate larvae, feed availability is also crucial, and often thought to be more important in overall larval development. The combined effects of temperature (12, 16, and 20 C) and feed concentration (1:1 mixed algal diet of Tetraselmis chui and Isochrysis galbana; 1,000, 10,000, and 20,000 cells ml-1) were examined in P. ventricosa larvae over 17 days. There was found to be significant combine effect of sampling day, temperature, and feed concentration on larval shell length. By 17-d post-fertilisation, the combined effect of feed concentration on larvae in each temperature became more apparent. Unlike the results of Chapter 3 when larvae were fed a single species (T. chui) diet at 10,000 cells ml-1, larvae reared at the colder temperatures had the largest shell lengths by 17-d post-fertilisation. At 17-d fertilisation, larvae at 12 C grew best when fed 20,000 cells ml-1, and 16 and 20 C grew best at 10,000 and 1,000 cells ml-1, respectively. Overall, the results of this research fill in many gaps in our knowledge about the life history of Paphies ventricosa.

T1  - Cod in hot water : the thermal physiology of blue cod (Parapercis colias), black cod (Paranotothenia angustata) and emerald rock cod (Trematomus bernacchii)
AN  - 2309914244
AB  - Climate change is believed to be altering the Earth's climate, and driving ocean systems into conditions which could fundamentally and irreversibly modify ecology systems, in particular ectothermic marine ecosystems are at great risk. By understanding the relationship between temperature and rates we gain insight into species thermoregulatory behaviour. This project was aimed at investigating what effects chronic and acute temperature changes will have on three species of fish species, blue cod an endemic New Zealand species, black cod a Sub-Antarctic species, and emerald cod an Antarctic species. Fish were exposed to chronic temperature changes for a period of four weeks to gain insight into their ability to acclimate to new temperatures. Blue cod were chronically exposed to 8 C, 12 C, 18 C, black cod were chronically exposed to 8 C, 12 C and emerald cod were exposed to 2 C. Ventilation rate, heart rate and oxygen consumption were measured during acute temperature changes to determine tolerance ranges and the limiting factors to thermal tolerance. Each species was exposed to a different range of acute temperatures depending on chronic exposure temperature. The results showed that blue cod proved to be the most thermally flexible species, showing partial to complete acclimation, with large shifts in tolerance range between acclimations. Black cod and emerald cod showed a shift in tolerance ranges but did not show strong acclimation. In conclusion ventilation rate and heart rate proved to be limiting factors to thermal tolerance. At higher acute exposure temperatures fish were pushed past their tolerance ranges and oxygen consumption reached levels so high that even if ventilatory and circulatory systems did not fail, it would only be a matter of time before mortality occurred. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms behind limitation of thermal tolerance to gain an in-depth understanding of how climate change will impact marine ecosystems.

T1  - Thermal biology of the New Zealand sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus
AN  - 2300590765
AB  - Acclimation of adult E. chloroticus for 90 days at projected seawater temperature for the next century (i.e., 24 C) resulted in decreased feeding, respiration, negative growth and complete loss of reproductive output. The thermal limits (median lethal temperature (LT50) and lethal temperature) of adult E. chloroticus were not affected by duration of acclimation at 18 and 24 C (i.e., one or four weeks) or by acclimatization summer (21 C) seasons. However, acclimatization of animals to winter season resulted in lower thermal limits. Expression of hsp70 mRNA in adult E. chloroticus increased with temperature during a thermal shock (1 C day-1) with a maximum expression at ca. 27-28 C regardless of the acclimation/acclimatization temperature. Performance of early development at different temperatures (18, 21, 24 C) was evaluated using gametes obtained from acclimated and non-acclimated wild adults. Development was successful in all treatments, and larvae raised at 24 C developed faster and were larger compared to larvae cultured at 18 and 21 C. Culture temperature did not affect respiration rate, lipid and protein content of the gastrulae, 2- and 4-arm larvae. Whereas for the 8-arm larval stage, larvae cultured at 18 C had more lipid compared to those from 24 C, and larvae cultured at 24 C had more protein compared to those from the 18 C treatment. When cultured at 24 C, both gastrula and 2-arm larvae showed higher LT50. Thermal shock had an effect on the hsp70 mRNA expression of gastrulae, 2- and 4-arm larvae. The genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions during early development of E. chloroticus were evident, with some genotypes performing better than others at higher temperatures. In addition, including a second stressor (i.e., low salinity, 29 ppt) during the first 24 hours of development affected fertilization, development rate, gastrulation success and normal development, with seawater temperature only affecting development rate and gastrulation. Nonetheless, an increase in temperature from 18 to 21 C minimized the negative effect of low salinity on development rate and gastrulation of E. chloroticus. Overall, the sea urchin E. chloroticus may have the potential to adapt to warmer seawater conditions induced by climate change due to the presence of developmental plasticity in the early life stages to withstand higher seawater temperatures and lower salinities. However, adaptation would require the presence of competent reproductive adults able to carry on plasticity through generations. Considering the total loss of reproductive output observed at higher temperatures, an increase in seawater temperature could dramatically influence the persistence of northern populations of E. chloroticus, leading to flow-on effects in the subtidal ecosystem. Finally, the results obtained in this research provide detailed information on the physiological and molecular responses of both adults and early life stages of E. chloroticus under current and projected seawater temperatures in a climate change scenario.

T1  - Coping with a warming world: genetic studies on thermal adaptation and links to membrane saturation in Antarctic fish
AN  - 2276015546
AB  - Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) plays a key role in thermal adaptation across organisms, allowing alteration of membranes in response to temperature change. Thermal adaptive signatures at the gene sequence level and in the primary structure of the SCD protein require investigation, especially in Antarctic fish. Owing to the stenothermal nature of Antarctic fish, it remains unclear whether they have retained capacity to modulate their membranes in response to warming temperatures. The hypothesis that membrane saturation, a major thermal adaptive mechanism, will occur at reduced capacities in Antarctic notothenioid fish in response to elevated temperatures was tested SCD sequences were isolated from 21 fish species (Antarctic and non-Antarctic notothenioids, and non-notothenioid Antarctic fish species). Phylogenetic analyses supported the ancestral SCD1 duplication into SCD1a and SCD1b. Lineage-specific duplication and loss of gene duplicates were identified for specific orders of fish. Cold adapted notothenioids (Antarctic and non-Antarctic with Antarctic ancestry) SCD isoform sequences were evolutionarily distinct from non-Antarctic sequences. SCD1a and 1b from Antarctic fish displayed more diversity with amino acid composition varying across the isoforms. SCD1a isoforms had more sites under positive selection and a higher rate of molecular evolution in Antarctic fish than SCD1b, suggesting neofunctionalisation of SCD1a. Ubiquitous tissue expression of SCD1b was seen in both the Antarctic species Trematomus bernacchii and Pagothenia borchgrevinki, while ubiquitous expression of SCD1a isoform was seen in T. bernacchii but not in P.borchgrevinki. Transcriptional response of the SCD isoforms, along with the biochemical response of membrane saturation, in T. bernacchii and P. borchgrevinki livers were determined in fish acclimated at 0 C (control temperature), 4 C and 6 C. Overall, temperature had a significant effect on the expression of SCD1a and SCD1b in T. bernacchii, while expression of SCD1a was low to be detected by qPCR in P. borchgrevinki. Membrane lipid composition of Antarctic fish species varied significantly when compared to the New Zealand Perciforme species Notolabrus celidotus. Thermal acclimation at 4 C did not result in any detectable change in membrane saturation state or membrane cholesterol in either Antarctic species. However, 6 C thermal acclimation induced a homeoviscous adaptive (HVA) response in the benthic species T. bernacchii, as shown by the significant increase in membrane saturated fatty acids, and a significant decline in unsaturated fatty acids. HVA response was not observed in P. borchgrevinki. This is the first study to determine thermal adaptive signatures in the SCD gene of Antarctic fish and provides evidence for asymmetric molecular evolution of SCD. This provides a framework for future functional work. This is also the first study to show a homeoviscous response to higher temperature in an Antarctic fish although only for one of the two species examined.

AN  - 1910786165; 2017-01055-087
AB  - The purpose of this aspect of the study was to assess the relative impacts of climate-related challenges across seasons on fishes that inhabit the nearshore ecosystem. To do this, blood-based physiological responses to elevated temperature, salinity, acidity, and temperature + acidity of adult bonefish, adult checkered puffer, and juvenile yellowfin mojarra were compared across seasons (i.e., summer and winter). Bonefish exposed to climate-related challenges experienced elevated Cl-, Ca2+, lactate, and glucose levels in the summer relative to winter, and elevated temperature resulted in glucose and ionic disturbances in both seasons. Similarly, independent of season, checkered puffer exhibited elevated hematocrit, glucose, and cortisol levels when exposed to elevated temperature relative to ambient conditions. Yellowfin mojarra experienced minimal physiological disturbance to the climate-related challenges, but independent of season, elevated temperature increased hematocrit values relative to ambient conditions. Interestingly, the combined stressor, temperature + acidity, did not result in a synergistic or additive physiological disturbance in nearshore fishes. Results indicate that adult bonefish exposed to climate-related challenges experience the greatest physiological disturbances in the summer relative to the winter, with temperature being the most challenging stressor. Collectively, temperature change will be the most challenging climate-related stressor for nearshore fishes, particularly in the summer, and may result in more energy being expended to maintain homeostasis. The purpose of this aspect of the study was to define the performance of subtropical nearshore fishes to projected climate change scenarios and relate these findings to the ecology of nearshore ecosystem in the future. Adult bonefish, adult checkered puffer, juvenile yellowfin mojarra and juvenile schoolmaster snapper, were acclimated to ambient conditions, along with a range of elevated pCO2, salinity, and temperatures that coincide with, or exceed, the worst-case scenario predicted by the IPCC in 100 years. Post acclimation, fish performance was quantified by measuring standard metabolic rate (SMR) with intermittent-flow, static respirometry, and by chasing the fish to exhaustion (i.e., swimming performance (SP)). Bonefish and yellowfin mojarra experienced an increase in SMR of more than 65% when acclimated to seawater at 33&ordm;C, and all species experienced an increase in SMR and a decrease in SP at 34&ordm;C. Nearshore fishes acclimated to elevated pCO 2 and salinity experienced minimal disturbances in SMR or SP. Results indicate that elevated temperatures that coincide with (33&ordm;C), or exceed (34&ordm;C), the worst-case scenario predicted by the IPCC increased standard metabolic rates and reduced swimming performance for a number of nearshore fishes, with elevated pCO2 and salinity resulting in minimal disturbances in performance. To avoid costs associated with elevated temperatures, nearshore fishes may choose to migrate to more thermally stable environments, allocate energy differently, or increase feeding rates to meet energetic demands. The goal of this aspect of the study was to assess the vulnerability of nearshore fishes to climate change and to evaluate the ability of these fishes to adjust their physiological limits across seasons (i.e., phenotypic plasticity). To do this, the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and minimum (CTMin) of adult bonefish, adult checkered puffer, juvenile yellowfin mojarra, and juvenile schoolmaster snapper were determined across seasons. Acclimatization response ratios (AZRR; DeltaCTMax DeltaT-1 and DeltaCTMin DeltaT-1) were typically greater than 0.60 for all species, a value greater than most previously reported for fish species from variable thermal environments.

T1  - Evolutionary Innovations in Ants to Thermally Stressful Environments
AN  - 1886408461
AB  - Temperature is a fundamental environmental force shaping species abundance and distributions through its effects on biochemical reaction rates, metabolism, activity, and reproduction. In light of future climate shifts, mainly driven by temperature increases, how will organisms persist in warmer environments? One molecular mechanism that may play an important role in coping with heat stress is the heat shock response (HSR), which protects against molecular damage. To prevent and repair protein damage specifically, Hsps activate and become up-regulated. However, the functional diversity and relevance of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in extending upper thermal limits in taxonomic groups outside marine and model systems is poorly understood. Ants are a good system to understand the physiological mechanisms for coping with heat stress because they have successfully diversified into thermally stressful environments. To identify and characterize the functional diversity of Hsps in ants, I surveyed Hsp orthologues from published ant genomes to test for signatures of positive selection and to reconstruct their evolutionary history. Within Hymenoptera, ants utilize unique sets of Hsps for the HSR. Stabilizing selection was the prevailing force among Hsp orthologues, suggesting that protein activity is conserved. At the same time, regulatory regions (promoters) governing transcriptional up-regulation diversified: species differ in the number and location of heat shock elements (HSEs). Therefore, Hsp expression patterns may be a target for selection in warm environments. I tested whether Hsp expression corresponded with variation in upper thermal limits in forest ant species within the genus  Aphaenogaster. Whole colonies were collected throughout the eastern United States and were lab acclimated. There was a positive relationship between upper thermal limits (Critical Thermal maxima, CTmax) and local temperature extremes. Upper thermal limits were also higher in ant species that lived in open habitats (shrub-oak and long-leaf pine savannah) than species occupying closed habitats (deciduous forest). Ant species with higher CTmax expressed Hsps more slowly, at higher temperatures, and at higher maximum levels than those with low CTmax. Because Hsps sense and repair molecular damage, these results suggest the proteomes of open relative to closed canopy forests are more stable. Although deciduous forest ant species may be buffered from temperature stress, it is likely that temperature interacts with other environmental stressors such as water and nutrient availability that may impact upper thermal limits. I measured the influence of dehydration and nutrition stress on upper thermal limits of forest ants from a single population. Ants that were initially starved were much less thermally tolerant than controls and ants that were initially desiccated. Because ants are likely to experience similar combination of stressors in the wild, upper thermal limits may be severely overestimated in single factor experiments. Therefore, realistic forecasting models need to consider multiple environmental stressors. Overall, adaptive tuning of Hsp expression that reflects better protection and tolerance of protein unfolding may have facilitated ant diversification into warm environments. However, additional stressors and mechanisms may constrain the evolution of upper thermal limits.

T1  - Land surface phenologies and seasonalities using cool earthlight in temperate and tropical croplands
AN  - 1882251393
AB  - In today’s world of increasing food insecurity due to more frequent and extreme events (droughts, floods), a comprehensive understanding of global cropland dynamics is critically needed. Land surface parameters derived from the passive microwave Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS (AMSR-E) and AMSR2 data enable monitoring of cropland dynamics and they can complement visible to near infrared (VNIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) data. Passive microwave data are less sensitive to atmospheric effects, cloud contamination, and solar illumination constraints resulting in finer temporal resolution suitable to track the temporal progression of cropland cover development compared to the VNIR data that has coarser temporal resolution due to compositing to lessen the atmospheric effects. Both VNIR and TIR data have moderate to fine spatial resolution compared to passive microwaves, due to the faint microwave flux from the planetary surface. I used AMSR, MODIS, TRMM, and simplified surface energy balance (SSEB) data to study cropland dynamics from 2003–2015 in North Dakota, USA, the Canadian Prairie Provinces, Northern Eurasia, and East Africa: a contrast between crop exporting regions and a food insecure region. Croplands in the temperate region are better studied compared to that of the tropics. The objective of this research was to characterize cropland dynamics in the tropics based on the knowledge gained about the microwave products in the temperate croplands. This study also aimed at assessing the utility of passive microwave data for cropland dynamics study, especially for tropical cropland regions that are often cloud-obscured during the growing season and have sparse in situ data networks. Using MODIS land cover data, I identified 162 AMSR grid cells (25km*25km=625km2) dominated by croplands within the study regions. To fit the passive microwave time series data to environmental forcings, I used the convex quadratic (CxQ) model fit that has been successfully applied with the VNIR and TIR data to herbaceous vegetation in temperate and boreal ecoregions. Land surface dynamics in the thermally-limited temperate croplands were characterized as a function of temperature; whereas, a function of moisture to model land surface dynamics in the tropical croplands. In the temperate croplands, growing degree-day (GDD), NDVI, and vegetation optical depth (VOD) were modeled as a convex quadratic function of accumulated GDD (AGDD) derived from AMSR air temperature data, yielding high coefficients of determination (0.88 ≤ r2 ≤ 0.98). Deviations of GDD from the long term average CxQ model by site corresponded to peak VI producing negative residuals (arising from higher latent heat flux) and low VI at beginning and end of growing season producing positive residuals (arising from higher sensible heat flux). In Northern Eurasia, sites at lower latitude (44°–48° N) that grow winter grains showed either a longer unimodal growing season or a bimodal growing season; whereas, sites at higher latitude (48°–56° N) where spring grains are cultivated showed shorter, unimodal growing seasons. Peak VOD showed strong linear correspondence with peak greenness (NDVI) with r2>0.8, but with a one-week lag. The AMSR data were able to capture the effects of the 2010 and 2007 heat waves that devastated grain production in southwestern Russia and Northern Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, respectively, better than the MODIS data. In East African croplands, the AMSR, TRMM, and SSEB datasets modeled as a convex quadratic function of cumulative water-vapor-days displayed distinct cropland dynamics in space and time, including unimodal and bimodal growing seasons. Interannual moisture variability is at its highest at the beginning of the growing season affecting planting times of crops. Moisture time to peak from AMSR and TRMM land surface parameters displayed strong correspondence (r2 > 0.80) and logical lags among variables. Characterizing cropland dynamics based on the synergistic use of complementary remote sensing data should help to advance and improve agricultural monitoring in tropical croplands that are often associated with food insecurity.

T1  - Ecosystem Impacts of Consumer Evolution: Intraspecific Variation in the Elemental Phenotype of Aquatic Consumers
AN  - 1876886997
AB  - Primary production in aquatic ecosystems is often limited by the availability of nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P). Animals can substantially alter the relative availability of these nutrients by storing and recycling them in differential ratios. Variation in these stoichiometric traits, i.e., the elemental phenotype, within a species can link organismal evolution to ecosystem function. I examined the drivers of intraspecific variation in the elemental phenotype of aquatic consumers to test for the generality of these effects. Over a thermal gradient in Panamá, I found that average specific growth grate and body P content of the mayfly Thraulodes increased with environmental temperature, but that these patterns were due to site-specific differences rather than the direct effects of warmer temperature. In a meta-analysis of published studies, I found that in fishes intraspecific variation in dietary N:P ratio had a significant effect on excretion N:P ratio, but only when accounting for consumption. I tested for the effects of variation in consumption on excretion N:P ratio among populations of the fish Gambusia marshi in the Cuatro Ciénegas basin in Coahuila, Mexico. G. marshi inhabits warm groundwater-fed springs where it often co-occurs with predatory fishes and cool runoff-dominated wetlands which lack predators. Using stoichiometric models, I generated predictions for how variation in environmental temperature and predation pressure would affect the N:P ratio recycled by fishes. Adult female G. marshi excretion N:P ratio was higher in runoff-dominated sites, which was consistent with predators driving increased consumption rates by G. marshi. This result was supported by a diet ration manipulation experiment in which G. marshi raised on an  ad libitum diet excreted N:P at a lower ratio than fish raised on a restricted diet ration. To further support the impacts of predation on phenotypic diversification in G. marshi, I examined how body morphology varied among habitats and among closely related species. Both among and within species, predation had stronger effects on morphology than the physical environment. Overall, these results suggest that predation, not temperature, has strong effects on these phenotypic traits of aquatic consumers which can alter their role in ecosystem nutrient cycling through variation in consumption rates.

T1  - Thermal adaptation in the American red squirrel (<i>Tamisciurus hudsonicus</i>)
AN  - 1844986099
AB  - Temperature is one of the most important environmental variables impacting organisms. For endotherms, temperature can be extremely testing since they need to maintain a constant core body temperature at any given ambient temperature. However, endotherms can survive both in very hot areas and very cold areas and mammals are, for example, found throughout the world and widespread species may face temperature differences of more than 80°C over their distribution range. Recent changes in climate are likely to have great impact on thermoregulatory abilities and with increased regional temperatures due to anthropogenic climate change more and more species are being pushed to, or beyond their thermal limits in parts of their distribution, making an understanding of adaptation to temperature particularly important.     The following series of studies examine multiple aspects of thermal adaptation in the American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). The first chapter asks if the distribution of the species is limited by temperature. Indeed, three of the major predictors of the species distribution reflect temperature, i.e. mean annual temperature, minimum temperature of the coldest month and maximum temperature of the warmest month. Knowing the importance of climate in determining the species niche helps us understand the selective pressures it asserts. The second and third chapters discuss adaptations found in the morphology of T.hudsonicus that relate to temperature. Both whole body and skull dimensions vary with temperature, with smaller animals being found in colder areas, either as a response to reduction of heat loss in cold conditions or increased heat loss in hot conditions. This is consistent with Bergmann’s Rule, but with regards Allen’s Rule, only one protuberance or appendage – the nose - was found to show an adaptive trend and that shows a relationship with humidity rather than temperature. The fourth chapter examines variation in gene expression levels in response to temperature and elevation. The gene expression responses suggest that  T. hudsonicus has a decreased metabolic activity in cold conditions compared to warm (or alternatively increased metabolic activity in warm conditions) and shows greater metabolic responses to increased elevation than to temperature. Overall T. hudsonicus is found to live within limits determined by temperature and shows both morphological and gene expression response to temperature.

T1  - Invasion physiology: do physiological characteristics facilitate the spread of invasive fish species?
AN  - 2477218450
AB  - Physiological traits are likely to present a fundamental constraint on the environments that are habitable to a given species. Whole animal traits associated with energy metabolism and locomotory performance are especially likely to be important in this regard. Nevertheless, the effects of traits such as metabolic rate and aerobic scope (AS) on the distributions of native and invasive species have not been thoroughly studied. In a first step toward understanding these effects, I performed a phylogenetically-informed analysis of links between AS and absolute latitudinal distribution range in 86 fish species. From the results obtained in Chapter 2, I found no evidence for the direct implication of AS in the currently observed distributions of fishes. Moreover, no association between AS and invasion success in 59 freshwater fish species (23 invasive and 36 native species) was found. These results suggested that peak AS is not a constraining or determining factor in the distribution range and invasion success in fish.  Following on from these results, there is a possibility that there could be a trade-off between peak and breadth of performance for AS across temperatures in fishes. Species with a higher peak AS might only be able to function normally over a narrow range of temperatures. In Chapter 3, I collected AS data from literature and conducted phylogenetical-informed analysis to test the trade-off theory in AS across 28 fish species. No evidence could be found for a trade-off between peak and breadth performance in AS for fish.  Interspecific competition between invasive and native fish species might cause changes in the structure of native fish communities. Furthermore, these interactions can vary over competitive context (e.g. for prey or cover), differ over a range of environmental factors (e.g. in response to temperature variation) and be linked directly or indirectly to species' metabolic capacity (e.g. aerobic scope). With increasing temperatures, invasive species might gain a competitive advantage over the native species though shifts or changes in competitive behaviour and traits such as AS.  I examined interactions between native stone loaches (Barbatula barbatula) and invasive bullheads (Cottus gobio), two species which occupy the same ecological niche and that are believed to compete for similar habitats. Physiological and behavioural traits could play an essential role in the spread of invasive species, particularly the internal underlying mechanisms that modulate an organism’s response to environmental changes. In Chapter 4, I examined physiological and behavioural responses of invasive bullheads and native stone loaches to acute and acclimated temperature shifts (13-21 degrees C). I found that invasive bullheads had a lower AS than stone loaches over all temperatures tested. Bullheads were also less active overall and preferred colder temperatures (17.5-19 C) than stone loaches (21-22.4 C). Therefore, changes in AS in response to thermal variation are unlikely to be a contributing factor in invasion success of bullheads in Scottish rivers.  In Chapter 5, I investigated the direct competitive interactions between bullheads and stone loaches at three different temperatures (13 C, 17 C and 21 C). Overall, native stone loaches were better competitors for shelter use and in particular at colder temperatures. There was no clear causal effect of temperature or AS on competitive outcomes between these two species. Low competitive ability found in invasive bullheads suggests that bullheads may not be actively displacing stone loaches.  It has been suggested that a successful invader should have a wide tolerance range for different environmental factors. For example, invasive species might be more tolerant to hypoxic events as compared to native species. In Chapter 6, I looked at the hypoxia tolerance and avoidance behaviour of bullheads and stone loaches over different dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 30%, 25% and 20% DO levels). Surprisingly, I found that bullheads were less tolerant to hypoxic conditions with a Pcrit value of 4.96 mg O2 l-1 at 14 C. Avoidance behaviour towards progressive hypoxia was similar between bullheads and stone loaches; both species spent most of their time utilising the shelter even in hypoxic conditions. Low tolerance towards hypoxia did not give an advantage to invasive bullheads over native stone loaches in particular during harsh environmental conditions.  The results from this thesis suggest that metabolic traits may not play as strong a role in constraining species distributions as previously suspected, particularly in the specific case of interactions between native stone loaches and invasive bullheads in Scotland.

T1  - Genomics and Cell Biology of Symbiois in <em>Aiptasia</em>, a Model System for Coral-Algal Symbiosis
AN  - 2448646364
AB  - The health and success of coral reef ecosystems is dependent upon the symbiotic relationship between coral animals and dinoflagellate algae (Symbiodinium spp.). Under thermal stress, corals can suffer from bleaching, a loss of Symbiodinium cells from the coral tissue that can be fatal during prolonged or severe stress. If stress is mild, corals can recover from bleaching through the repopulation of remaining Symbiodinium, or acquisition of new Symbiodinium from the environment. Despite the ecological importance of these processes, little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the establishment of coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis or its breakdown in bleaching. In this thesis, my collaborators and I use the small, symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia as a model system for the study of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. Using Aiptasia, we were able to test a popular hypothesis that the susceptibility of coral to bleaching is largely determined by the thermal tolerance of its algal symbiont and found that, indeed the type of algae hosted by an anemone had a strong effect on its susceptibility to bleaching, and that there was little effect of host genotype. Next, we examined the role of lectin-like proteins in the establishment of symbiosis and symbiosis specificity in Aiptasia. We identified several genes with homology to lectins that are differentially expressed between aposymbiotic and symbiotic Aiptasia. We recombinantly expressed one of these lectin-like proteins, Ctl1, and found that it bound preferentially to a type of algae that is incapable of establishing a symbiotic relationship with Aiptasia, suggesting a possible role in discriminating between different Symbiodinium types. Finally, to further the development of Aiptasia as a model system, we sequenced and assembled the Aiptasia genome. To search for genes and pathways that may be involved in symbiosis, we compared the genome of Aiptasia to the symbiotic coral Acropora digitifera, and to the anemone Nematostella, which does not have a symbiotic relationship with dinoflagellates. We identified a novel class of lectin-like genes that are enriched in the genome of the two symbiotic cnidarians, and may play a role in symbiosis establishment. The work presented here furthers our understanding of a symbiosis that is vital to the health of coral ecosystems and may provide tangible support to conservation efforts by identifying factors that contribute to susceptibility to bleaching and the ability to recover by acquiring novel symbionts.

T1  - Ecology of Gambel's Quail (<em>Callipepla Gambelii</em>) in Relation to Water and Fire in Utah's Mojave Desert
AN  - 2445419063
AB  - The efficacy of providing water sources in desert ecosystems to enhance wildlife populations and their distribution continues to be debated among wildlife managers. Some argue wildlife water developments provide a direct benefit to numerous species, while others point to the potential that wildlife water developments alter competition or predation dynamics and disrupt native communities. Additionally, some have argued that the availability of water may become more important to wildlife in the face of vegetative changes associated with expansive fire and conversion of shrub or forest lands to grasslands which alters the thermal landscape available to animals. I evaluated the influence of free water and expansive fire on aspects of the ecology (habitat selection, space use and survival) of Gambel's quail (Callipepla gambelii) in the Mojave Desert of southwestern Washington County, Utah, USA. I attached radio-transmitters to a total of 206 quail (74 adult males, 67 adult females, and 65 juvenile males and females) and monitored them from 2010 – 2013. For chapter one of my thesis, I evaluated the response of marked quail to removal of access to water in a before-after controlled impact (BACI) design. I found little influence of water removal on survival as models with this effect received little to no support and overlap in confidence intervals occurred between treatment and reference groups. Likewise, the distance from the center of the summer home range to the nearest water source did not differ by year (F = 1.63; P = 0.19) or treatment (removal of water) (F = 0.89; P = 0.35) and pairwise comparisons of distances for the treatment by year interaction were not significant (P > 0.05 in all cases). For size of home range area, however, I found strong effects for year (F = 3.07; P = 0.03), treatment (F = 4.67; P = 0.03), and their interaction (F = 7.61; P = 0.01). Mean home range size for quail was 6.10 and 1.63 km2 for animals in the reference area during treatment years (2012 and 2013) compared to 5.07 and 8.99 km2 for quail in the treatment area during 2012 and 2013, respectively. Removal of water influenced size of summer home ranges, but not the location of the summer home range or survival rates. I hypothesize that removal of access to free water required quail in the treatment area to expand their space use patterns in 2013 in order to satisfy water demands via pre-formed water. For chapter two of my thesis, I evaluated habitat selection of Gambel's quail in relation to vegetation type, topographic features, water, and recent (4-7 years) expansive fire. Gambel's quail selected areas of decreased roughness which were closer to water and fire boundaries than random locations. I found that quail preferred moderate (< 10 degrees) hillsides and ravine bottoms. I found no evidence that quail avoided the burned areas within their home ranges and 80% of their telemetry points were <500 meters from a burn edge. The Beaver Dam slope topography strongly influenced habitat selection for Gambel's quail and they showed strong selection for water sources during summer months. These data also suggest that wildfires have had limited impact on habitat selection by this species, four to seven years later.

T1  - Impacts of waterborne copper and silver on the early life stage (ELS) of zebrafish (Danio rerio): physiological, biochemical and molecular responses
AN  - 2416439149
AB  - The current study aimed to assess the toxic effects of waterborne concentrations of copper as an essential trace element, and silver as a non-essential trace element, on biochemical processes and the molecular biology of the early life stages (ELS) of zebrafish. The first experiment of the current study (Chapter 3) aimed: 1. to determine the time of nkx2.5 gene expression, a gene involved in cardiac development, relative to the time of embryonic development. 2. To assess the toxic concentration of the copper and most vulnerable and sensitive stage of the embryos less than 1 hour post fertilization (hpf) exposed to the copper via water route. The result of the experiment showed that the expression of the nkx2.5 gene reached a maximum at 16 hpf. The first 10 hpf of the embryonic development was the most vulnerable and critical stage of the developing embryos, and characterized by increased mortality as copper concentration increased, and delayed and decreased hatching success. Exposure of embryos for 72 hpf to a concentration of 500 micro-g L-1 Cu increased heart rate, whereas the exposure of the embryos at the blastula stage only, showed decreases in heart rate. The third part of the experiment evaluated the protective effect of calcium as a major cation of water hardness on Cu toxicity. Embryos age less than 2 hpf were exposed to copper (0, 100, 250, and 500 micro-g L-1), with or without added calcium (40 mg L-1). An increase in embryonic Cu accumulation was observed in live and dead embryos exposed to Cu, with and without added calcium. Calcium concentration increased with embryonic copper tissue concentration in dead embryos. Na+ and K+ concentrations were higher in live embryos compared to dead embryos, and a 4 fold decrease in Na+K+-ATPase activity was seen in live embryos exposed to copper compared to controls. There was no effect of copper on total glutathione. Expression of nkx2.5 as one of the essential genes for the formation and development of the heart increased significantly; approximately 10 fold in the presence of Cu+Ca in comparison to the unexposed control or Cu exposure alone. Whereas expression of mt2 increased significantly 6 fold compared to the control during Cu exposure without added Ca2+. The second experiment (Chapter 4) aimed to investigate the effect of the dissolved Ag+ as AgNO3 on the survival of the early life stage of zebrafish. Embryos less than 2 hpf were exposed to silver 0 (no added Ag), 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 and 15 micro-g L-1 Ag as AgNO3 for up to 72 h. Although, the survival was not affected by increasing concentrations of total silver, a decrease in hatching and increase in heart beat was observed. A significant increase in embryonic silver accumulation in both live embryos (at 24 and 72 hpf) and dead embryos (at 24 hpf) was observed. The accumulation of silver in 24 hpf live embryos was more significant than in dead embryos. Dead and live embryos at 72 hpf exposed to Ag had lower Na+ and K+ concentrations. Live embryos also showed a transient increase in Ca2+ concentration at 24 h. Four fold increases in Na+K+-ATPase activity, Mt2, and total glutathione concentration were seen in embryos after 72 h of exposure to AgNO3 compared to controls. In contrast, nkx2.5 gene expression was significantly decreased by 3 fold in 24 h aged embryos exposed to silver compared to controls. Due to the lack of studies that investigate the effect of silver on protein expression profiles during the early stages of development of zebrafish, the third experiment (Chapter 5) aimed to investigate the effect of silver on the changes of the expressed proteins of zebrafish embryos at the segmentation stage (24 hpf). The proteomics analysis successfully identified total of 810 proteins in the embryonic homogenate and quantified changes in their abundance in response to silver exposure. MS analysis showed the induction of new proteins which were absent in control embryonic homogenates. Also the analysis revealed there were increased expression of proteins such as zona pellucida glycoprotein, ATP synthase subunit alpha and beta, stressed proteins such as metal chaperones and heat shock proteins, antioxidant proteins such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn), glutathione S-transferase M, and glutathione S-transferase and proteins related to muscular development such as myosin heavy polypeptide 2, actin alpha 1 skeletal muscle, slow myosin heavy chain 1, actin cytoplasmic 1, and tropomyosin proteins. Overall, the thesis confirmed that the early life stages of zebrafish are sensitive to metals and that there are critical windows of toxicity during development. Metal exposure at early stages of the development initiate several disturbances in biochemical processes as well as changes in molecular biology that affect fish survival.

T1  - Combined effects of ocean acidification, ocean warming and oil spill on aspects of development of marine invertebrates
AN  - 2416437205
AB  - The aim of this thesis was to investigate the effects of combined exposure to ocean acidification (OA), ocean warming (OW), and incorporating local drivers such as oil pollution on the development, morphology and physiology of three economically and ecologically important marine invertebrates. These are Northern shrimp Pandalus borealis, Northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica, and the green sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. All are cold-water species, assumed to have a narrower tolerance than more temperate species, and so could be particular sensitive to combined stressor affects. Both Northern krill and to a lesser extent Northern shrimp larvae survived experimental conditions, mirroring those predicted under a future global change scenario (combined OA and OW exposure). Neither was hatching success affected. Both shrimp and krill larvae exhibited accelerated developmental rates and incurred greater maintenance costs as a result of exposure to these stressors. Shrimp larvae showed accelerated developmental rates (9 days), increased metabolic rates (+20 %), and increased feeding rates (+20 %), but reduced growth (9 %) when exposed to OW compared with the control. OA increased development rate but only at the control temperature. Although juvenile mortality of krill was not affected by predicted OA/OW conditions, metabolic rate increased significantly (+ 36 %), as did larval developmental rate, while number of moults, feeding rate and growth (67 %) decreased significantly (67 %, 60 % and 8 % respectively). Accelerated development was accompanied by greater maintenance costs possibly due to experience a mismatch between energy supply and demand. Both species had an excess of food, and so growth reduction was more likely to be associated with higher metabolic demands in the future global change treatments. Food shortage in situ, due to variable food availability in the sea and/or mismatch with key prey species (algae and zooplankton) could result in more negative effects on growth and ultimately survival. Green sea urchins were also able to survive OA exposure, without detectable effects on hatching success. However, at day 44 post-fertilization, larval body length in the OA treatment was 9 % lower compared to the control. Furthermore, there was a significant tendency of urchin larvae to increase swimming activity in the OA conditions that might indicate compensatory feeding. Elevated maintenance and repair costs as a result of exposure to multi-stressors affected the energy budget of all the three species studied here resulting in reduced growth. Global drivers (OA and OW) resulted in trade-offs with more energy reallocated to swimming activity and metabolism, rather than growth. Exposure to oil reduced the acquisition of energy by reduced feeding which in turn resulted in less energy being available for growth. Both shrimp and sea urchin larvae showed reduced activity and feeding when exposed to oil. It is possible that the reduced swimming activity observed may be due to a narcotic effect of the oil. Furthermore, early stage sea urchin larvae showed increased mortality when exposed to oil while the older larvae did not, indicating a stage specific toxicity to oil for sea urchin larvae. The combination of global drivers and oil pollution acted additively on growth for both sea urchin and shrimp larvae. The impact of combined drivers on the size of shrimp larvae was equal the sum of the negative impacts observed for each driver: a 5 % reduction when exposed to OA and OW, a 9 % reduction when exposed to oil, and a cumulative 15 % reduction when exposed to all stressors. Similarly, the impact of combined drivers on the size of sea urchin larvae was equal to the sum of the negative impacts observed for each driver: a 14 % reduction when exposed to OA, a 9 % reduction when exposed to oil, and a 21 % reduction when exposed to all drivers. Therefore, the study demonstrated the additive physiological effects of OA, OW and a contaminant, and indicated that larval (sea urchin and shrimp) resilience to future changes (i.e. pollution) could be greatly reduced if larvae were already energy limited and severely stressed (reduced development) as a result of exposure to the global drivers. This study therefore shows the importance that the effective management of local drivers such as oil pollution could have against the backdrop of OA and OW, and emphasises that it is important to study impacts of toxicants, such as an oil pollution, in the context of predicted changes in the environment, as OW and OA are becoming major concerns. Finally, the fact that some local and global drivers seem to act additively should encourage local managers to act on local driver regulations, to obtain positive effects on local populations and environment and thereby rendering them more resilient to the negative impacts of future global drivers.

T1  - Plasticity &amp; adaptations of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis: responses to nutrient availability &amp; insight into inherent thermal tolerance
AN  - 2394045210
AB  - Sustaining an environment which conveys a high resilience to reef corals is critical in order to mitigate the immediate threat of climate change to reef ecosystems. The nutrient environment plays a significant role in sustaining the stability of the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis, making anthropogenic nutrient pollution as well as the climate change driven nutrient impoverishment of oceanic waters pressing threats to coral reef persistence. Yet, many aspects of coral nutrient biology remain poorly understood, impeding science driven management strategies. This thesis aimed to advance our knowledge on how different nutrient environments affect the functioning of the coral-algal symbiosis by teasing apart the interacting effects of two principal nutrient sources (dissolved inorganic nutrient uptake and heterotrophic feeding), as well as of the two essential nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus, both in dissolved inorganic and particulate organic forms. This was achieved through long-term exposure (up to 1.5 years) of the Euphyllia paradivisa-clade C1 Symbiodinium association to replete (+N+P), limited (-N-P), or imbalanced (+N-P/-N+P) dissolved inorganic nutrient availabilities in combination with targeted host feeding with balanced or nitrogen enriched prey items. Thereby, this work stood apart from past investigations by yielding definitive phenotypes representative of different nutrient availabilities. Moreover, the importance of food quality when considering the benefit of heterotrophy to reef corals had previously been overlooked. Findings suggest that heterotrophy provides a greater benefit to the coral host than to the symbiont and is unable to compensate for diminished dissolved inorganic nutrient availability, demonstrating a significantly greater dependence of the symbiosis to the latter nutrient source. A balanced N/P ratio, both in dissolved inorganic and particulate organic form, was shown to be essential for the stability of the symbiosis and for the nutritional benefit provided by heterotrophy. Particularly nitrogen enrichment resulted in severe nutrient stress and compromised thermal stress resilience, implying a vital reliance on a continued supply of phosphorus and emphasising the necessity of managing nitrogen pollution and monitoring N/P ratios. Zooxanthellae ultrastructural biomarkers established in this thesis (cell size, lipid body, starch granule and uric acid crystal accumulation, accumulation body fragmentation) hold potential for the aid in the identification of, and discrimination between different forms of nutrient stress in reef corals. Yet, ultimately corals need to adapt to warmer oceans. Diverse Symbiodinium genotypes convey varied thermal tolerance to their coral host. Yet, the mechanisms underpinning their thermal sensitivity remain largely elusive. The second aim of this thesis was to examine the role played by the algal membrane composition. The intact polar lipid biochemistry of a thermally-sensitive (clade C) and -tolerant (clade D) type were characterised by HPLC-ESI tandem mass spectrometry. Distinctions in chloroplast membrane composition could be related to differential inherent thermal tolerance. Moreover, vast differences in the lipid biochemistry of extraplastidic membranes were identified, exemplifying unprecedented metabolic differences among Symbiodinium clades. Biochemical markers of a thermally tolerant phenotype (MGDG/DGDG ratio, glycolipid saturation) could advance our understanding and projections of the potential of reef corals to acclimate and adapt to future climate change scenarios.

T1  - The impacts of ocean acidification and warming on the Antarctic bivalve, Laternula elliptica
AN  - 2317289447
AB  - Various responses to ocean acidification (OA) and warming were studied in the larvae of L. elliptica. Larvae were raised under control pH and temperatures (c8.00 and -1.7C, respectively) and conditions representing projections for the Antarctic by the end of the century and 2300 (pH 7.80, 7.65 and -0.5, +0.5 and +1.5C), both individually and in combination. The effect of these stressors on fertilisation rates, development timing and rates of abnormalities at various life stages were examined. Furthermore, SEM analysis determined the impacts of OA and warming on larval shell growth and morphology. Respiration rates and lipid reserves in developing larvae were also determined.  Elevated temperatures largely improved development, increased early fertilisation rates, and accelerated development through all larval stages and larvae reached competency 5 d ahead of larvae at the control temperature. This would allow for faster settlement, significantly reducing time spent in more vulnerable development stages. Elevated temperatures also improved calcification in later D-stage larvae increasing shell lengths and reducing pitting and cracking, suggesting these larvae will be in a better condition at settlement. Reduced pH improved fertilisation at control temperatures, but impaired it at elevated temperatures, although overall fertilisation was greater at pH 7.65/0.4C compared to the control temperatures (60% and 50%, respectively). Developmental delays were observed at reduced pH; however the effect varied between experiments. In the first, developmental delays due to reduced pH were observed at all experimental temperatures and were greatest at 0.4C, while in the second experiment, delays only occurred at ambient temperature. The delay at ambient temperature was 2 d in both experiments. The delaying effect in the first experiment was mitigated by the overall faster development with elevated temperature. Larvae at pH 7.65/0.4C reached competency at 22 d compared to 24 d at pH 7.98/-1.6C. Larvae from the most extreme treatment (pH 7.65 and 0.4C) still reached the D-larvae stage two days ahead of those at control conditions (pH 7.98 and -1.6C).  D-larvae from reduced pH treatments had significantly larger shells at elevated temperatures. While light microscopy suggested no significant effect of pH on development, SEM analysis revealed that reduced pH severely impaired the quality of the larval shell at all temperatures. They were more likely to have abnormal larval shapes, as well as malformed hinges and edges. These malformations will carry over into juvenile stages, impairing swimming and feeding capacity, which would reduce settlement success and condition. Additionally, these larvae had lower shell integrity, with high frequencies of pitting and shell damage, including cracking under reduced pH, although elevated temperatures partially ameliorated this effect. Larval shells at reduced pH were weaker, indicating they will be more susceptible to injury and predation. This would flow on to later life-history stages, impairing success in settlement when juveniles must bury in the sediments.  The lipid reserves in the larvae were large, dominated by triacylglycerols and phospholipids. Despite significant depletion of both these lipid classes during development, more than 65% of the original lipid pool remained at the D-larval stage, suggesting significant reserves exist for later metamorphosis. Higher metabolic rates are expected in response to pH and temperature stress and supporting these rates may be energetically demanding. However, larvae did not alter use of any of the lipid classes at elevated temperatures. Increases in oxygen consumption in the larvae at elevated temperature indicated low temperature tolerances in L. elliptica larvae, possibly around -0.5C. These may place increased energetic demands on later life stages that cannot depend on maternally provided resources. Under OA, the energetic demands of calcification are expected to increase due to the costs of active maintenance of the pH of cellular fluids. However, respiration rates were unaffected by reduced pH and a greater lipid reserve remained in larvae at pH 7.65/-1.7C compared to all other treatments, suggesting larvae may respond to OA by reducing calcification.  Additionally, the impact of reduced pH on biodeposition was assessed in adult L. elliptica. Short term (48 h) exposure to reduced pH (to pH 7.54) did not influence biodeposition rates or the organic composition of faeces and pseudofaeces, although compositional changes may have occurred in the latter due to increased mucous production or altered particle selection.

T1  - Cultivation of the New Zealand geoduck clam, Panopea zelandica
AN  - 2276015038
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify conditions that optimize Panopea zelandica broodstock conditioning, fertilization, larval growth and metamorphosis, and juvenile and young adult growth. P. zelandica broodstock were conditioned within a combination of three water temperatures (7-8, 11-12, and 16-17 C) and three feeding rations (10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 cells mL-1 of Chaetoceros muelleri and Tisochrysis lutea, 1:1 cell counts) for 73 days. After conditioning, similar percent matured and dry condition index values were observed on geoducks among temperatures. Glycogen, protein, and lipid analyses indicated that geoducks within all treatments achieved a positive energy balance, except for those in the treatments combining the highest temperature and lowest feeding ration. The physiological, morphological, and behavioral characteristics throughout the larval developmental process were determined for P. zelandica larvae, which were reared in a flow-through system at 17 C and 35 ppt. The metamorphic induction of larval P. zelandica was tested with different neuroactive compounds. None of the tested chemicals increased the proportion of metamorphosed geoducks, and in some cases the chemical inhibited metamorphosis and caused significant mortality, despite having been used extensively with other species, such as mussels and oysters. P. zelandica juvenile and young adults were acutely thermally challanged at five different temperatures representative of potential farming conditions. Temperatures higher than 19 C resulted in a reduction of aerobic scope for activity and clearance rate for both juvenile and young adults, which may lead to reduced performance and elevated mortality. P. zelandica juvenile and young adults were exposed to normoxia, mild hypoxia, and severe hypoxia. Large geoducks maintain oxygen consumption across an oxygen gradient more effectively than small geoducks. Also, the aerobic scope of small geoducks decreased significantly with declining PO2, while large geoducks maintained their aerobic scope under hypoxia.

T1  - Hermaphroditism, lengths at maturity and fecundity in Protopterous aethiopicus from Lake Bisina in Kumi district.
AN  - 2193122317
AB  - African lungfish; Protopterus aethiopicus is one of the native fish species in African continent and typically inhabit swampy and weedy areas of lakes and rivers where dissolved oxygen levels are low day time, temperatures are high and seasonal drying are common; condition they are adopted to because of their broad diet, wide tolerances to variations in temperature and salinity, parental care of eggs and young one aerial respiration and ability to aestivate.  They also have a broad geographical distribution but sympatric populations are probably rare and are not documented. The adaptations that enable the protopterids to inhabit harsh environments may also be important in the re-colonization of areas subjected to local extinctions or artificial propagation to improve human nutrition and in their competition for resources with other fishes. All these factors therefore contributed to the selection of lungfish for this study to enhance Aquaculture production globally. Chapter one of the research cover the areas of the Back ground of the study, statement of the problem, scope of the research, objectives and justification. The literature review covers the following areas; Gonadal development, hermaphroditism and sex ratio, length at maturity, and fecundity in Protopterous aethiopicus. In methodology the following methods were used for Data collection; use of records from the field (Lake Bisina), observation and personal judgments. Histological result revealed no occurrence of hermaphroditism in lungfish, ratio of male: female was 1:1 in both sexes of lungfish, the length at sexual maturity was 25.6 and 27.18 respectively and the findings also indicates that Protopterous aethiopicus in lake Bisina had 76 mature eggs per gram and that there was a strong positive relationship between fecundity and the body weight. In conclusion, there was no hermaphroditism observed, the ratio of male to female was 1:1 in favor of both sexes in the population, maturity was observed to be uniform in both male and female Protopterus aethiopicus with a class length size of 25.6cm and 27.18cm respectively. Probably these samples were very few to strongly justify the conclusion of maturity; this may be due to variation in climatic condition which favored faster maturity in Protopterus aethiopicus in Lake Bisina. The fish had high fecundity of about 1500eggs to 3000eggs in female and literature about lungfish shown that this fish provides parental care after lying eggs. This implies that it should have few eggs that it can protect against predators. Recommendation, more research should be done not only in Lake Bisina but also other Lakes where lungfish predominantly resident. The fishermen should use nets with recommended mesh sizes to avoid catching the brood fish that mature at a total length of about 27.18cm which could have been conserved for reproduction purpose. The future prospects of this study are to artificially culture lungfish to supplement on Aquaculture production that will improve human nutrition, food quality and Food safety. Government should therefore revise the fisheries law and support the enforcement team to reduce the high fishing effort on the Uganda’s water bodies that result in to over exploitation of brood stock. In order to increase food security, improve household income of Ugandan through domestication of Protopterous aethiopicus; a lot of research should be done about the reproductive behaviors of this fish in both Lake Bisina and other lakes where lungfish are predominant species.

T1  - Evaluation of the critical thermal maximum of wild caught clarias gariepinus and protopterus aethiopicus.
AN  - 2193122227
AB  - Due to increased accumulation or greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of combustion of fossil fuels and poor farming practices, it is predicted that global climate temperatures will increase by between 2-30C, in the next 50 to 100 years. Temperature, among other abiotic factors has the strongest influence on the physiological performance of aquatic ectotherms such as fish. It interferes with the fish's cardiac oxygen transport mechanism and negatively affects growth at extremes. Increases in temperature will lead to geographical shifts, changes in species distribution, reduction in species performance and fitness, and a reduction in species abundancy or face local extinction. Aquatic organisms in the tropics arc more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than those in the temperate and arctic regions. This is due to their narrow thermal window attributed to the lack of wide seasonal differences in temperature in their ecological environments. Also, tropical aquatic organism have low acclimation capacity since they live in environments with temperatures slightly above their physiological optimum and very close to their critical thermal limits. As a result, any slight increase in environmental temperatures may push them beyond their physiological thermal limits. In the present study, the effect of temperature on Propterus aethiopicus and Clarias gariepinus fingerlings was determined in terms of critical maximum (CTmax) and glucose levels. The results will be used by aquaculture scientists to provide conducive environment for production of both African catfish and African lungfish. Fingerlings from the wild were acclimated at ±5°C, 26°C, 29°C and 31°C for two weeks in the in culture tanks, where after, the respective CTmax were determined and blood withdrawn for determining glucose leve1s using ONE TOUCHR. The results obtained showed that CTmax of both fish species increased with acclimalion temperature. For glucose levels, the result also revealed that there was no significance difference in the glucose levels of P. aethiopicus with varying temperatures. However, there was a significant difference in glucose levelsls of C. gariepinus fingerlings with varying temperature. As such, it was observed that the two species are differently affected by temperature changes.

T1  - Salt tolerance in African lungfish (protopterus aethiopicus): implications for their domestication
AN  - 2193121377
AB  - Survival and stress tests conducted to determine the tolerance of African lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus) juveniles to salt. The study was conducted at ARDC-Kajjansi for a period of 2 months. African lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus) juvenile samples (21.8g ABW) were collected from Lake Nawampasa and acclimatized at room temperature of (25±24°C). Randomly selected fish samples were exposed to different sail concentrations ranging from (0.0 to 9.9 g/L)for ninety six 96 hours to determine the LC50. For survival test, each tank was examined to count the number of mortalities and the results were recorded daily. For the stress test, blood samples were collected from the survivors and taken to Ebenezer clinical laboratory for Cortisol test. The behaviors of fish in response salt exposure were record; on the introduction into the treatments, fish frequently tried to jump out of the fish holding tanks and showed heightened activity indicated by rapid to and fro movement and vigorous swimming of the fish. With time, (i.e between 0.5 to 2 hours) fish gradually became lethargic, and showed erratic movement; developed muscle spasm and body convulsions, they tended to settle to the bottom of the tank (i.e between 6 to 10 hours) and later they were found to swim on their back or lateral side with occasional body jerking and later started to die (i.e between 8 to 12 hours) especially at high concentrations (8.0. - 12g/L). In terms of survival; there was no significant difference in survival between salinity concentrations (0.00 g/l, 1.5g/1, 2.8g/1, 4.1, 5.4 and 6.7 g/l; (p > 0.05); whereas a significant difference in survival was observed between all the above concentration with concentrations 8.0g/1 and 9.9g/1 (p < 0.05). For stress test; there was no significant difference in mean cortisol Ievel between the concentrations (0.00 g/l, 1.5g/1, 2.8g/1, 4.1,5.4 and 6.7 g/l; (p > 0.05). However a significant difference in mean cortisol level was observed between concentrations 8.0 g/l and 9.9 g/l (p < 0.005). In conclusion, African lungfish fingerlings of 21.8g (ABW) are highly sensitive to salt with a LC50 of 7.94 g/L for 96 hours.

T1  - The Evolution of Pollution Tolerance in the Marine Copepod <i>Tigriopus</i>
AN  - 2158361847
AB  - This body of work focused on how evolutionary processes influence pollution tolerance in the marine copepod Tigriopus. The applications of these results are meant to improve the implementation of tools such as bioassays that use the response of test specimens to inform management practices. Pollution tolerance was examined across geographical space to identify whether there were significant differences in pollution tolerance in Tigriopus from different areas. Chapter 2 had a brief survey of studies that used bioassays and determined that the majority of these studies to not account for the location of where their test specimens were obtained. This was followed by a survey of pollution tolerances between sister species and within each species of copepods and found significant variation in tolerance between species and within each species. Biological variation has the danger to be dismissed as experimental error, which will erode bioassays as a foundational tool in environmental management. Pollution tolerance was also examined across time, which included history of exposure as well as duration of lab maintenance. Chapter 1 found that with chronic exposure to Cu and TBTO, these copepods developed increased tolerance. For Cu, the increased tolerance was an acclimation like response because it was gained relatively rapidly but lost during a recovery period when pre-exposure to Cu was removed. TBTO exhibited an adaptation like response, where tolerance appeared only several generations of exposure and was maintained even after the pre-exposure was removed. To gain a better understanding of this increase in pollution tolerance, RNAseq was used to understand gene expresson analysis in Chapter 5. These results showed that expression patterns broadly clustered by duration of exposure, acute (96hr) vs. chronic (7 generations). However, results identified the potential for certain gene category, such as ion regulatory associated genes to exhibit a generalized response during acute exposure but a more chemical-specific response during chronic exposure. In Chapter 3, the effect of transplanting populations from the field to the lab on pollution tolerance was examined in two species of Tigropus. Results showed that pollution tolerance significantly changed for the majority of populations in the lab often within a single generation. This change in pollution tolerance was also in different directions, with Cu tolerance increasing and TBTO tolerance decreasing. The increasing Cu tolerance was linked to the potential differences in the lab, with heat stress being one candidate while the decreasing TBTO tolerance was linked to periods of starvation. To examine how the environment may have shaped pollution tolerance, water temperature monitoring and seawater chemical analysis was used to characterize the habitat of T. californicus at different sites in Chapter 4. These results indicate the high level of Cu tolerance in Tigriopus is likely not due to direct exposure to high Cu concentrations, but rather other environmental stressors, with one candidate being temperature stress. The collective theme of this work showed that pollution tolerance can significantly change due to exposure history, duration in the lab, and the environment the organism evolved in.

T1  - The Influence of Spatiotemporal Variation in Ambient Temperature on the Ecology and Physiology of Birds
AN  - 1910406245
AB  - Ambient temperature has profound effects on the ecology, physiology and distribution of organisms. Ambient temperature regimes vary across spatial and temporal scales and understanding how organisms cope with this variation is a primary goal of ecological and evolutionary physiology. An emerging framework for understanding how geographic variation in ambient temperature is related to thermal physiology is the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH), which predicts that thermal tolerance breadth should increase with increasing levels of temperature variability. Studies documenting latitudinal increases in the thermal tolerance breadth of ectotherms and thermoneutral zone (TNZ –a proxy for thermal tolerance) breadth in endotherms have provided broad empirical support for the CVH.   However, most previous tests of the CVH have focused on large-scale patterns of variation in thermal tolerance breadth across latitudinal temperature gradients, and little is known about how the CVH applies to small spatial scales (i.e. within a geographic locality) and also to temporal (seasonal) patterns of temperature variability. Furthermore, understanding how ambient temperature regime influences heat tolerances is becoming increasingly important due to climate warming, yet patterns of geographic variation in heat tolerances of endotherms have not been characterized. Finally, few studies have investigated the potential ecological consequences of variation in thermal physiology, particularly in endotherms. My dissertation chapters address each of these knowledge gaps in turn to provide a more complete investigation of the CVH and a clearer picture of how spatiotemporal variation in ambient temperature has influenced the physiology and ecology of birds.   Chapter 2 explores the influence of ambient temperature regime on variation in TNZ breadth at multiple spatial scales. I captured ∼140 bird species at three geographic localities (Illinois and South Carolina, U.S.A. and the Republic of Panama) and used flow-through respirometry to measure TNZ breadth. In phylogenetically informed analyses, I found that temperature variability rather than latitude per se was the best predictor of both interspecific and intraspecific geographic variation in TNZ breadth at large spatial scales (across geographic localities). I also found that migratory tendency was an important predictor of interspecific variation in TNZ breadth, with migratory species having TNZ breadths intermediate between temperate and tropical resident species. In contrast, at a smaller spatial scale (within a geographic locality), ecological traits associated with ambient temperature regime (vertical niche and habitat association) were not significant predictors of variation in TNZ breadth. My results indicate that temperature variability at the micro- or macro-habitat level is not associated with TNZ breadth in birds, and suggest that the CVH may not apply to smaller spatial scales in endotherms.   Chapter 3 extends the CVH from spatial to temporal (seasonal) patterns of temperature variability and tests a secondary prediction of the CVH – that flexibility of thermoregulatory traits should increase with temperature seasonality. To test this prediction, I used flow-through respirometry to measure seasonal flexibility in five thermoregulatory traits [body mass (M b), mass-adjusted basal metabolic rate (BMR), LCT, UCT and TNZ breadth] in suites of temperate (high seasonality) and tropical (low seasonality) birds. In phylogenetically-controlled analyses, I found that temperate species exhibited greater seasonal flexibility in LCT, UCT and TNZ breadth than did tropical species. Winter-acclimatized individuals of temperate species exhibited large reductions (up to ∼9 °C) in LCT and modest (∼2-3 °C) reductions in UCT relative to summer-acclimatized individuals, resulting in an increased winter TNZ breadth. Although some tropical species exhibited flexibility in LCT, UCT and TNZ breadth, patterns of seasonal flexibility were idiosyncratic and the mean amount of seasonal change was close to 0. In contrast, seasonal flexibility in Mb and mass-adjusted BMR did not differ between temperate and tropical species. My analysis suggests that patterns of geographic flexibility in thermoregulatory traits directly linked to thermal tolerance (e.g. LCT, UCT, TNZ breadth) conform to the CVH, whereas other traits (e.g. BMR, M b) do not. Furthermore, the patterns I documented contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that species from environments with low temperature variability (e.g. lowland tropical species) may have reduced physiological flexibility relative to their temperate counterparts and may be more sensitive to climate change.   Chapter 4 examines patterns of heat tolerance among tropical and temperate birds in an effort to provide the first analysis of geographic variation in avian heat tolerance. I then coupled heat tolerance data with ambient temperature data to test the prediction that tropical species will be more vulnerable than temperate species to future climate warming, as has been documented in numerous ectothermic taxa. I used flow-through respirometry coupled with temperature-sensitive passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to measure three traits [UCT, heat-strain coefficient (HScoeff – the slope of the relationship between Tb and Ta above the UCT) and critical thermal maximum (CTmax – the Ta at which birds become hyperthermic and lose the ability to regulate Tb)] that comprise heat tolerance. Contrary to previous studies of ectotherms, I found limited evidence of reduced heat tolerances in tropical species. In phylogenetically-controlled analyses, although temperate species had slightly higher (∼2 °C) CTmax, HS coeff and UCT did not differ between temperate and tropical birds. Importantly, these subtle differences in heat tolerance do not seem to translate into systematic differences in vulnerability to climate warming. Thermal safety margins did not differ significantly between temperate and tropical species, and seem to be large enough to allow for physiological tolerance of projected warming rates. Overall, my data do not indicate that tropical birds will be any more physiologically vulnerable to climate warming than temperate species, in contrast with previous patterns described in ectotherms.    Chapter 5 focuses on the potential ecological consequences of variation in thermal physiology. Understory insectivorous birds of Neotropical forests are a guild that is disproportionately sensitive to disturbance, experiencing population declines and local extirpation in response to forest fragmentation. One hypothesis for their declines is the microclimate hypothesis, which posits that the novel abiotic conditions (i.e. increased temperature and solar radiation, decreased humidity) that habitat fragmentation introduces may physiologically challenge understory insectivores and contribute to their population declines. An important assumption of the microclimate hypothesis is that understory insectivores have narrow physiological tolerances because they inhabit the forest understory, which is an incredibly stable and buffered environment. To test the microclimate hypothesis, I radio-tagged individuals of nine understory insectivore species at three sites along a precipitation gradient in central Panama and compared the microclimates (ambient temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation) that they selected with randomly chosen microclimates to test for the preferential use of particular microclimates (i.e. microclimate selectivity). I found no evidence of selectivity for any of the nine species I sampled on a seasonal or spatial basis. Microclimate variation was minimal in the forest understory at all sites, particularly in the wet season. Understory insectivores did not use microhabitats characterized by high light intensity, and may be sensitive to light, though the mechanism remains unclear. The lack of microclimate variation in the understory of tropical forests may have serious fitness consequences for understory insectivores due to climate warming coupled with a lack of thermal refugia.

T1  - The Effects of Elevated <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and Temperature on Embryonic Development, Larval Survivorship, Condition, Calcification, Morphology, and Behavior of the Florida Stone Crab, <i>Menippe mercenaria </i>
AN  - 1899133376
AB  - The emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere over the last century has increased atmospheric and oceanic temperatures, and has led to a decrease in oceanic pH. The increased ocean temperatures and reduced pH have been detrimental to marine life. In addition, Florida’s watersheds have suffered from decades of disrupted hydrology and diverted runoff, which has increased nutrients and changed coastal carbonate chemistry. Although the adult stages of many marine species are capable of tolerating fluctuations in environmental conditions (i.e., elevated pCO2 and temperature), marine larvae that hatch in coastal habitats may not have the ability to detect, respond to, or even tolerate such conditions. This study examined the response of the Florida stone crab, Menippe mercenaria, as a model for coastal crustaceans, to determine the impacts of elevated temperature and ocean acidification (OA) on embryonic development and hatching success. The study determined the impacts of simultaneous exposure to both elevated temperature and OA on stone crab survival, larval growth, larval condition, and larval morphology throughout development. The study also examined whether changes in environmental conditions affected the ability of larvae to orient vertically. More specifically, the geotactic swimming behavior of larval stone crabs was tested to determine if elevated temperature and pCO2 impacted geotaxis orientation, and if geotactic responses change throughout larval development. The impacts of OA on stone crab embryonic development and hatching success was determined by maintaining ovigerous females in conditions that mimicked present-day (pCO2 ∼ 360 ppm, pH = 8.1) and future carbonate conditions (pCO2 ∼ 1500 ppm, pH = 7.5). To determine the effects of simultaneous exposure of stone-crab larvae to elevated temperature and pCO2, larvae were raised in a fully crossed experiment with two treatments, temperature, and pCO2, each with two levels. The two temperature levels were 30°C and 32°C, and the two pCO2  levels were ∼450 ppm and ∼1100 ppm. This study also synthesized the experimental work by parameterizing a matrix-population model using the larval survivorship data to predict the population densities of larval stone crabs under future temperature and OA scenarios.   The elevated pCO2 treatment (1000 ppm) significantly reduced the rate of embryonic development (i.e., time to hatching) by ∼32%, but had no effect on the size of developing embryos (i.e., embryonic volume). Larvae that successfully hatched were not morphologically different among treatments, although hatching success was reduced by 38% in the elevated  pCO2 treatment. Exposure to elevated  pCO2 and ambient temperatures significantly reduced larval survivorship, which was exacerbated by elevated temperature. Indeed, exposure to elevated temperatures had the greatest effect on larval survivorship and development. Larvae raised in the combined treatments (i.e., both elevated  pCO2, and temperature) exhibited a ∼79% decrease in survivorship relative to the control. The molt-stage duration was ∼1.2 days shorter when larvae were exposed to elevated temperatures. However, stage V larvae reared in the elevated pCO2 and ambient temperature exhibited a significantly longer molt-stage duration than stage V larvae in controls. Larval condition (i.e., ash free dry weight), Ca and Mg content, Mg/Ca ratios, and larval morphology showed no significant differences among treatments. Geotactic responses varied throughout ontogeny and directional movement was dependent on pCO2 level, rather than on temperature. Stage III larvae, which swam upwards under ambient  pCO2 conditions, showed a significant reversal of their swimming orientation (i.e., downward swimming), when exposed to elevated  pCO2.   These results indicate that future changes in seawater pCO 2 may reduce the reproductive success of stone crabs. The significant decrease in survival at elevated temperatures may also have a negative effect on larval supply, which will be detrimental to the stone-crab populations. Reductions in reproductive output and larval supply could have potential socioeconomic implications for the stone-crab fishery, unless the crabs are able to acclimatize or adapt to future seawater conditions.   Geotactic responses were more adversely affected by OA rather than by temperature. Typically, early to mid-stage larvae of brachyuran crab larvae elicit swimming behaviors that position them at or near the surface, where currents facilitate transport offshore. When exposed to elevated  pCO2, the swimming behavior of stage III larvae changed, suggesting that mid-stage stone crab larvae may be positioned deeper in the water column, which may reduce their advection potential to offshore areas. Reducing advection may result in individuals being exposed to different conditions and different predators than typically experienced when larvae are transported offshore.   The population model, using the stage-specific larval survivorship data from the experimental treatments, showed that ∼14.8% of the control population survived to post-larval stage. Elevated pCO2, elevated temperature, and the combined treatment (elevated pCO 2 and elevated temperature) resulted in 11%, 6.5%, and 6.8% survival to the post-larval stage, respectively. The sensitivity analysis indicated that earlystage larvae (stage-II) were most sensitive to mortality, particularly in control simulations. Elevated pCO2 and temperature shifted the sensitivities to late-larval stages (i.e., stages IV and V). This shift was potentially a consequence of greater effects of ocean acidification on more developed larval stages, with more pronounced anatomical features. The sensitivity analyses indicated that elevated pCO 2 and temperature had the greatest impact on late-stage larvae. These results suggest that new recruits into the stone-crab fishery will be affected by both exposure to elevated pCO2 and temperature, which are expected by the end of the century, unless larvae tolerances to such conditions improve.

T1  - Effects of Temperature on Amphibian Resistance and Susceptibility to Chytridiomycosis
AN  - 1888931925
AB  - Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis  (Bd), is responsible for amphibian population and species declines; however, variation in susceptibility exists within and among species. This variation has been associated with differences in temperature and differences in amphibian immune systems, including symbiotic cutaneous bacteria, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and antibodies. Few studies have addressed the effects of temperature and these components of amphibian immune systems on susceptibility to chytridiomycosis.    Chapter 1 tested if incubation temperature affected the antifungal metabolite production of cutaneous bacteria and if temperature affected these metabolites’ ability to inhibit the growth of Bd in vitro. Temperature did not have an effect on the antifungal metabolites produced, but did have an effect on their ability to inhibit the growth of Bd, with more inhibition at a higher temperature than at a lower temperature.     Chapter 2 tested the in vivo effects of temperature and cutaneous bacterial manipulations on frogs’ susceptibility. Temperature had an effect on the probability of infection, with frogs held at a lower temperature more likely to become infected and having a higher pathogen burden than frogs held at a higher temperature. There was not an effect of bacterial manipulations on the probability of infection or on pathogen loads, but did have an effect on survival, with Bd-exposed frogs that had an antifungal bacterium added to their cutaneous bacterial community suffering less mortality than Bd-exposed frogs with an unmanipulated community.    Chapter 3 tested the effects of temperature and the presence of AMPs on susceptibility as well as the effects of temperature on Bd-binding antibody production. AMP depletions did not have an effect on probability of infection or on pathogen loads while temperature did, with frogs held at a lower temperature having a higher probability and higher pathogen burdens. AMP depletions did cause higher mortality among Bd-exposed frogs. Temperature also had an effect on antibodies produced, with IgY antibodies recovered from Bd-exposed frogs held at a lower temperature having greater binding activity for Bd.     These results suggest that temperature is the predominant determining factor for chytridiomycosis infections, but AMPs and antifungal bacteria can increase tolerance to these infections.

T1  - Cold acclimation of chill coma mechanisms in the locust CNS
AN  - 1886436163
AB  - Temperature has profound effects on the neural function and behaviour of insects. When exposed to low temperature, migratory locusts (Locusta migratoria) enter chill coma (neuromuscular paralysis) and can resume normal body functions after returning to normal temperature. Our laboratory has studied phenomena underlying environmental stress-induced comas in locusts and found that they are associated with a sudden loss of K+ homeostasis and also a temporary electrical silence in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the mechanisms underlying chill coma entry and recovery are not well understood, particularly the role of the CNS has not been determined. Here, I investigated neural function during chill coma in the locust by measuring electrical activity in the CNS. As pre-exposure to moderately low temperatures, either chronically (cold acclimation) or acutely (rapid cold hardening; RCH), has been found to improve the insect’s cold tolerance, I also determined cold acclimation and RCH protocols that will improve the locust's cold tolerance and whether these protocols affect neural shutdown during chill coma in the locust. With an implanted thermocouple in the thorax, I determined the temperature associated with a loss of responsiveness (CTmin) in intact male adult locusts. In parallel experiments, I recorded field potential (FP) in the metathoracic ganglion (MTG) in semi-intact preparations to determine the temperature that would induce neural shutdown. I found that acclimation at 10 °C and RCH at 4 °C reduced chill coma recovery time (CCRT) in intact animal preparations and RCH at 4 °C for 4 hours reduced the temperature at neural shutdown in semi-intact preparations. These results suggest that pre-exposure to cold can improve the locust's resistance to chill coma and support the notion that the CNS has a role in determining entry into and exit from chill coma in locusts.

T1  - Modifying tuber size distribution, low temperature sweetening and tolerance to heat stress in processing potatoes (<i>Solanum tuberosum </i> L.)
AN  - 1878232519
AB  - Controlling tuber size distribution and the propensity for low temperature sweetening (LTS) of processing potatoes are key to optimizing quality and maximizing crop value. My research focused on (1) developing methods to increase tuber set and shift tuber size distribution in cv. Bondi, (2) investigating how low O2 storage modulates LTS of cvs. Innovator and Russet Burbank, (3) screening cultivars for tolerance to heat stress for retention of LTS-resistant phenotype and (4) determining the mechanism by which heat stress abolishes resistance to LTS.    Bondi produces vigorous foliar growth, low tuber set and high yields of large tubers that frequently exceed optimum size for seed and processing markets. We evaluated several methods for altering apical dominance, tuber set and size distribution of Bondi and its maternal parent Ranger Russet. Gibberellic acid (GA) applied to cut seed prior to planting reduced apical dominance, increased tuber set and decreased average tuber size; however, the optimal concentration to maximally shift tuber size distribution without decreasing marketable yield was 4-5-fold greater for Bondi than Ranger. The reduced sensitivity of Bondi to GA was likely inherited from its paternal parent Karaka, which displays similar morphological and developmental traits, indicative of high levels of endogenous GA.   Russet Burbank and Innovator are frozen processing cultivars with inherently different susceptibilities to LTS. Here we show how low O2 storage modulates cold-induced sweetening to reveal metabolic differences in LTS metabolism intrinsic to these cultivars. While storage of tubers in 2.5 kPa O2 greatly attenuated the initial LTS responses for both cultivars, the effect was only temporary in Innovator. Low O2 attenuated LTS by inhibiting invertase.   Heat stress exacerbated cold-induced sweetening of Ranger and Russet Burbank tubers (LTS-susceptible cultivars), and abolished the inherent LTS-resistance of Sage Russet, GemStar Russet, POR06V12-3 and A02138-2 tubers. Heat stress rendered invertase cold-inducible in the LTS-resistant but non-heat tolerant cultivars/clones. Payette and its maternal parent EGA09702-2, however, demonstrated considerable tolerance to heat stress for retention of LTS-resistance. Payette’s heat tolerance was conferred by the lack of cold-induction of invertase, similar to Innate® Russet Burbank (W8) tubers, where silenced invertase activity conferred robust tolerance to heat stress.

T1  - Mechanisms of population divergence along elevational gradients in the tropics
AN  - 1870529705
AB  - Elucidating the mechanisms that give rise to population divergence and eventually initiate speciation is a key step for understanding the evolution of biodiversity. Most theories of differentiation and speciation have traditionally focused on geographically isolated populations. However, there is growing evidence that speciation can occur due to divergent selection despite initially high gene flow. My doctoral dissertation project investigates the effects of environmental heterogeneity and geography in promoting phenotypic and genetic divergence along elevation gradients in natural populations of a poison frog,  Epipedobates anthonyi, across the landscape with a focus on environmental variation along elevational gradients. I studied populations distributed along a broad elevational gradient (0–1800 m above sea level) on the western slope of the Andes of southern Ecuador. First, I examined the relative roles of geographic distance and environmental gradients on genetic and phenotypic divergence. I found that populations are phenotypically divergent in size, color, and male advertisement calls, but they exhibit low genetic divergence at neutral loci. There is substantial gene flow between populations throughout the lowlands, but populations at higher elevations are relatively isolated. This is mainly due to a mountain ridge acting as a physical and possibly environmental barrier between northern and southern populations. Within elevational gradients, geographic distance corrected for topography is the main factor explaining both genetic and phenotypic divergence. However, when controlling for the effect of topographic distance, environmental conditions, such as temperature and precipitation between sites best explain observed patterns of genetic divergence, whereas environmental conditions at a given site best explains differences in phenotypic traits, presumably due to divergent selection pressures.    To study the effect of temperature variation along elevational transects on adaptive divergence, I measured thermal tolerance of tadpoles across elevation. I found that populations from higher elevation had higher cold tolerance, suggesting that changes in temperature along elevation may cause divergent selection in thermal tolerance. Additionally, tadpoles from all sites have the ability to shift their thermal tolerance in response to previous exposure to different temperatures.   Finally, to examine the degree of local adaptation to environmental conditions at high and low elevations, I conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment. I evaluated populations from high and low elevations from two elevational transects. Overall, I found that all populations have higher reproduction rates at low elevation. In fact, at high elevation, populations had very low reproductive rates or did not reproduce at all. However, variation in life-history traits differed between transects. Populations from one transect revealed a pattern that was consistent with the expectation under local adaptation, namely, low elevation frogs had higher reproduction than high elevation frogs at the low elevation site. In contrast, populations from the other transect had a pattern that would be expected under countergradient variation, namely higher elevation frogs had higher reproduction at the low elevation site. Intriguingly, low elevation frogs had overall higher reproduction rates than high elevation frogs, suggesting that frogs from low elevation have higher fecundity than their counterparts at high elevation.   Overall, the findings of my dissertation suggest that (i) phenotypic divergence occurs in the face of gene flow, (ii) environmental variation along elevation, particularly temperature, is a force that drives population divergence, and (iii) the influences of environmental conditions on populations are variable at the intraspecific level.

T1  - Phenology and cold tolerance of <i>Megacopta cribraria </i>: An invasive soybean pest at its northern limit
AN  - 1869344048
AB  - Megacopta cribraria, kudzu bug, is an invasive pest of soybeans in the Southeast United States, with a northern distribution limit in Maryland. Soybeans, however, are grown north of Maryland, which places producers at risk of future range shifts. Additionally, producers in the current distribution need a development model to aid management. To address both concerns, I studied the cold tolerance of the kudzu bug and its phenology. I examined the supercooling point (SCP) and lethal temperature to kill 50% (LLT50) of three populations over the fall of 2015 to determine the cold tolerance. I found the kudzu bug is a freeze avoidant species with an average SCP of -12.6°C and LLT50 of -5.1°C. I also determined that the kudzu bug moves to thermally protected leaf litter in late November to overwinter. To address phenology, I determined the kudzu bug requires 625 degree-days at a minimum temperature of 16°C to complete egg and nymphal development. Field validation fit the model well with a biofix of May 1st and 30 days for a preoviposition period. The phenological degree-day model indicates two generations per year and allows producers evaluate and time pest management strategies within a year. Cold tolerance enables producers to predict the surviving population each year as well as the potential for northward range expansion.

T1  - Effects of Temperature and Salinity Changes on the Early Life Stages of Corals from a Marginal Environment, Hong Kong
AN  - 1868424205
AB  - The importance of coral communities in marginal environment is increasingly being recognized as these communities could serve as temperature refugia for future reefs under the threat of global warming. Understanding the existing adult coral communities and coral recruitment status could provide information about how these communities are being sustained and how their resilience could be enhanced. Moreover, to better understand the possible consequences of climate change on reef building scleractinian corals in marginal environment like Hong Kong, laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the single and interactive effects of changes in salinity and temperature on the coral early life stages, including fertilization, early development, larval survival, settlement, post-settlement survival and growth. These data are crucial to address the critical knowledge gaps of multi-stressor response of corals, as well as the resilience and persistence of marginal coral communities under the threats of future climate change.    The first broad scale survey of juvenile coral was conducted in 12 sites in eastern and northeastern coral communities in Hong Kong, six of which are located inside marine parks. Additional three sites in Tolo Harbour and Channel (Tolo) were selected to evaluate the potential of natural coral recovery 15 years after chronic disturbance. Results revealed an overall average juvenile coral density of 6.0 individuals m−2 in these sites, ranging from 1.1–5.7 individuals m−2 (average 3.5) in eastern and northeastern coral communities to 3.8–36.2 individuals m−2 (average 16.2) in Tolo. However, most of the juveniles observed belonged to the single species of Oulastrea crispata. If excluding this species, the overall juvenile density dropped to only 1.5 individuals m−2, ranging from 0–5.1 individuals m−2 (average 1.8) in eastern and northeastern coral communities to 0–0.4 individuals m−2 (average 0.2) in Tolo.    Laboratory results showed that elevated temperature +3°C ambient may not have major significant ecological effects on early life stages of corals. The robustness of the larvae of Platygyra acuta, the most dominant coral in Hong Kong, in response to elevated temperature effects was affirmed. No significant effect of elevated temperature, up to +5 °C ambient, on settlement and post-settlement survival of the larvae after 56 days of exposure was detected. On the other hands, there were inconsistent effects of elevated temperature (+5°C ambient) on Acropora valida  and A. pruinosa, two other common branching corals in Hong Kong. In general, corals from Hong Kong appear to exhibit higher tolerance to elevated temperature when compared with those from more tropical regions.    The complexity of interactive effects of ocean warming and lowered salinity were revealed on different coral early life stages. For example, low salinity increased the chances of abnormal embryonic development of corals. Lowered temperature exacerbated this increase (synergistic effect) whereas elevated temperature reversed it (antagonistic effect). There was also a protective effect of elevated temperature (+3°C ambient) in enhancing larval settlement of P. acuta and A. pruinosa under lower salinities of 26 psu and 30 psu, respectively.    Transcriptomic changes in coral larvae are critically important for evaluating the responses of corals to environmental changes as they provide important insight into coral stress response mechanisms. The expression of genes in aposymbiotic coral larvae of A. pruinosa exposed to sub-lethal levels of thermal and salinity stress (+5°C ambient, 26 psu) was investigated. RNA-Seq data provided 123,968 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) corresponding to single and combined stressors. Investigation of the dominant gene function indicated that lowered salinity predominantly elicited a complex of metabolic responses, whereas elevated temperatures were associated with metabolic and cell protection responses, including those involved in DNA damage repair, protein degradation and signaling transduction pathways. Combined stressors led to synergistic response with less than half of the DEGs overlapped with those expressed from single stressors in total. Enriched pathways, including metabolism, signaling transduction, immune response and nervous system pathways were detected. Collectively, these findings highlight the complex molecular responses of coral larvae to stressors. These results also suggested that interactions between two stressors highlighted the potential of synergistic effects at transcriptomic level, which largely increased the vulnerability of coral in a multi-stressor environment.    Results from this thesis research revealed the high tolerance of coral early life stages from a marginal marine environment like Hong Kong to single and interactive effects of elevated temperature and lowered salinities. These point to the likely survival of these coral species under the threats of future global climate changes. The roles of corals from marginal environment in serving as the genetic stocks of corals and coral reefs in the future should be properly recognized and greater efforts should be put in place to protect these corals from other disturbances beyond their current tolerable levels.

T1  - Thermal tolerance of the common coqui frog (<i>Eleutherodactylus coqui</i>) in East Hawaii along an elevation gradient
AN  - 1865341977
AB  - Natural variation in the environment can be tolerated by animals via behavioral modification, adaptation, or physiological or developmental plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity, or acclimation, allows individuals to adjust physiological parameters to best suit the needs of their environment. Acclimation to temperature is a feature of successful invasive species and may be a contributing factor to the expansion of the coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) in its introduced range in Hawaii. Coqui frogs have been recorded on Hawaii Island since the late 1980s and pose a noise nuisance to humans. If the frogs expand into higher elevation, montane habitats, they may disrupt the ecosystems with noise and food web disturbances. The minimum tolerance of cold temperatures of coqui frogs along an elevational gradient in East Hawaii was measured and compared. Coqui frogs were found to have a flexible range of cold temperature tolerance, with differences in cold tolerance between populations, evidence of acclimation to lower temperatures, sex-specific thermal tolerance, and a lower thermal tolerance level in Hawaii than in their native Puerto Rico. However, a higher tolerance for cold did not correlate directly with elevation and there were no appreciable differences in hematocrit, plasma osmolality, or heart mass between acclimation treatments or populations. The overall range of shift in thermal tolerance after acclimation was 2–3°C, implying the thermal flexibility of coqui frogs may enable them to further expand their habitat in Hawaii to cooler, high elevation areas. Particularly sensitive areas should be monitored and managed to minimize ecosystem threats from coqui frogs.

T1  - Investigation of Lipid Profile Patterns Along Latitude in an Eastern Australian Cline and After Stress Selection in the Laboratory, and Experiments on Stress Tolerance with RNAi Knockdown of Lipid Biosynthesis Genes
AN  - 1859922106
AB  - Homeoviscous adaptation in membranes and changes in energy storage lipids such as triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the two main themes of adaptation to environmental conditions. Basal patterns of lipid compositional profile of Drosophila melanogaster along a latitudinal gradient in the eastern coast of Australia indicate variations of lipidome associated with climatic patterns. Lipidome data were collected for eight locations along the eastern Australian cline for both sexes in D. melanogaster and D. simulans.  To further investigate the relationship between lipidome patterns and environmental factors, we utilized laboratory selection studies using stress conditions including high temperature tolerance, desiccation survival, and chill-coma recovery. Furthermore, to gain insights into possible underlying mechanisms between lipid biosynthesis and stress tolerance, knockdowns using RNA interference (RNAi) for various lipid biosynthesis enzymes were investigated. Observations in geographic patterns in the eastern Australian cline include a higher degree of acclimation in membrane lipids in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE/PC) ratio for higher latitude populations. There are increases of abundance for polyunsaturated and monounsaturated phospholipids as latitude increased Additionally, D. melanogaster populations originated from the only urban population consist of higher abundances for most lipid classes when compared to all other locations along the latitude. In selection studies, PE/PC ratio did not have any noticeable variations under any of the stress selections. There is an increase of diacylglycerols (DAGs) in heat tolerance selected lines, this finding is consistent with the previous study of physiological response to heat stress. Furthermore, there is the unexpected finding of few responses to selection for chill-coma recovery in the laboratory. For RNAi knocked down studies, there is the surprising finding of chill-coma recovery patterns differ significantly between two isoforms of stearoyl-CoA desaturases knockdowns. Moreover, there are decreases in heat tolerance when TAG synthesis was disrupted. The cline study generates patterns of variation in lipids that suggests adaptation in wild populations. Insight into the evolution of lipid composition was obtained from stress-based laboratory selection experiments. Disruptions of lipid biosynthesis pathways provided insight into the relationship between lipids and stress tolerance.

T1  - The influence of climate change and evolution on mosquito life history traits and pathogen transmission
AN  - 1846950879
AB  - Many aspects of mosquito biology are highly sensitive to variation in temperature, which has led to predictions that climate change will alter the transmission of many vector-borne pathogens.  However, it is unknown how mosquitoes will evolve in response to changing climates.  We utilized common garden experiments and novel time-compressed climate change scenarios to examine standing geographic variation, species variation, and evolutionary change in the temperature dependence of four life history traits of mosquitoes (larval and adult survival, development rate, and biting rate).   First, we quantified spatial variation in life history traits for four populations of Culex pipiens mosquitoes, a primary vector of West Nile Virus in North America, to examine the extent to which mosquitoes might be adapted to local thermal environments.  We found substantial variation in life history traits among mosquito populations that was uncorrelated with local thermal conditions. This variation will shape the response of mosquito species to changing climates and will make the impact of climate change on vector-borne disease more variable and less predictable than previously thought.    Second, we quantified variation in life history traits and vectorial capacity for the two dominant mosquito vectors of Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.  Differences in life history traits were mixed with  Ae. albopictus having faster development, higher larval survival, and more frequent feeding, whereas Ae. aegypti had higher adult survival.  Ae. aegypti was a slightly more efficient vector of all four viruses, and vectorial capacity was highest for yellow fever virus followed by Zika, Chikungunya and dengue.   Lastly, we reared Ae. aegypti under three rates of temperature increase (+2°C, +4°C, and +5°C) and three control conditions (a 2°C decrease, and two temperature profiles with no net change) for one year to examine the potential evolutionary response to climate change.  Although there was significant among-treatment variation in four life history traits between the starting population and the six climate treatments, these differences were uncorrelated with the temperature regime the mosquitoes experienced, suggesting that the mosquitoes were adapting more to the increased variance in temperatures in the experiment than the differences in mean temperature.

T1  - Latitudinal variation of life history strategies in the burying beetle, <i>Nicrophorus orbicollis</i>
AN  - 1845337331
AB  - How organisms allocate resources to growth, reproduction, and body maintenance is expected to vary along latitudinal gradients. Two hypotheses explaining latitudinal variation are local adaptation and counter-gradient variation.  The local adaptation hypothesis proposes that populations do best in their source location and, as a result, do less well in other environments.  The counter gradient hypothesis proposes that one population out performs others across an environmental gradient because the first population’s source location has greater selective pressure than other locations. Temperature is one selective pressure that varies along latitudinal gradients, and life histories are expected to be sensitive to the variation. We test local adaptation and counter-gradient variation in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis. We looked at patterns of reproduction in populations from Wisconsin (high latitude), Indiana (medium latitude) and Oklahoma (low latitude).  Carcass preparation, reproductive success, and developmental timelines were quantified at temperatures representing typical environmental conditions of the breeding months for each population.  Along a latitudinal range  N. orbicollis, show variation in their ability to initiate reproduction, successfully   rear offspring, and the number of offspring they are able to raise on a carcass.  This variation suggest local adaptation in that, (1) beetles are less likely to initiate breeding at extreme temperatures, especially when that temperature is representative of ones experienced in their source range; (2) once beetles initiate reproduction, source populations produce relatively larger broods, and are more successful at source location temperature extremes.  This experiment shows that N. orbicollis is able to use temperature as a reliable environmental cue to determine whether or not reproduction should be initiated, providing unique insight into how behavior modification can be used to avoid costly reproductive attempts.  However, all other measurements of developmental timelines in our experiment (i.e. number of days to prepare a carcass, eggs laid, feeding hole, 1st instar arrival on carcass, and days developing on the carcass) were only affected by temperature.  This suggests a temperature tolerance constraint that may be shaping reproductive behavior and distribution.  This research gives unique insight into how  N. orbicollis cope with temperature conditions along latitudinal gradients by behaviorally avoiding costly reproductive attempts.

T1  - Heat treatment of empty storage bins and grain-processing facilities: Factors influencing efficacy against adults of the red flour beetle, <i> Tribolium castaneum</i> (Herbst)
AN  - 1842428268
AB  - Heat treatment, a more than 100-year-old technology, involves raising the ambient temperature of a an empty bins/storage space or a clean gran-processing facility to 50–60°C for 24 h or less to kill stored-product insects. Heat treatment is an environmentally benign and a safer alternative to chemical insecticides. The studies reported here were conducted to determine the effect of short-term exposure to sub-lethal temperatures on adults of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and their subsequent susceptibility to temperatures of 50 and 55°C for 60 and 15 min, respectively; to determine the effect of rearing T. castaneum at select elevated temperatures for 10 generations on their subsequent susceptibility to temperatures of 50 and 55°C; to determine the effects of age and sex on susceptibility of  T. castaneum adults to 50 and 55°C; and to determine the effectiveness of a diatomaceous earth (DE) formulation at several elevated temperatures below 50°C on the mortality of T. castaneum adults.    Results of the studies showed that short-term exposure between 24 and 72 h, to sub-lethal temperatures (32, 36, and 40°C) only increased survival for insects acclimated to 32°C. Acclimation at 36 and 40°C resulted in higher mortality after exposure for 24, 48, and 72 h at 50 and 55°C. Rearing insects at 32 and 36°C for 10 generations resulted in the highest survival of adults at 50°C. However, when adults reared at 32°C were exposed during heat treatment of Hal Ross Flour Mill, the adults were least susceptible to dynamically changing temperatures over time. Female  T. castaneum adults were more heat tolerant than males, and adults 1 d post-emergence were the most heat tolerant when exposed to 55°C for xx minutes compared with adults aged 7–42 d. The efficacy of DE was enhanced at higher constant temperatures, which can lessen energy inputs in order to obtain a complete kill of insects when temperatures do not reach 50°C or greater. Given the changing climate, it is very useful for researchers to understand the implications of increasing temperatures on the heat tolerance of insects.

T1  - Physiological and Ecological Impacts of Changing Environmental Temperatures on Bees
AN  - 1836098609
AB  - In this dissertation, I investigated the mechanistic basis for the effects of changing temperatures on bees. Physiological impacts of changing temperatures on bees were assessed by investigating the levels of energy stores and the composition of lipids and the ecological impacts were assessed by studying the role of temperatures in determining bee-parasite interactions. I developed and validated an optimized protocol for extraction and quantification of three major energy substrates (lipids, sugars and glycogen) for application with bees. The fraction of total energy contributed by lipids, sugars and glycogen varied with body size and across altitude for bumblebees but was invariant for honey bees. Prevalence and loads of Nosema cerana, the only parasite detected in bumblebees, was reduced at high altitudes relative to low altitudes. No parasites were detected in honey bees with the exception of one sample, which likely had Crithidia spp. (to be confirmed through sequencing of the PCR product). Gas-liquid chromatography analysis of fatty acid composition revealed significant differences among bee genera that differed in thermal physiology and feeding behavior. Organisms take advantage of a diversity in lipid types to alter membrane lipid composition thereby maintaining membrane fluidity, and thus membrane functionality across a wide range of temperatures, as proposed by the homeoviscous adaptation (HVA) hypothesis (Sinensky 1974). Bees collected across altitudes and the growing season had changes in lipid composition as would be predicted by the HVA hypothesis, likely in response to colder temperatures at higher altitudes and early in spring and warmer temperatures at low altitudes and later in the summer. These variations in lipid composition (in particular, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, UFA:SFA and the unsaturation index) may arise from variation in the lipid composition of the pollen, the primary food source, or may be a direct physiological response to the temperatures bees experience. I therefore assessed the effects of acclimation to three temperature cycles for four days on lipid composition of bees. I found no change in unsaturation index for these temperature-treated bees but body size was a covariate, which determined the effects of acclimated temperatures on UFA:SFA.   Future studies should go further deeper and assess the quantities of energy in different body compartments as decrease in one substrate in a given part may be contrasted by an increase in quantity of the same substrate in another part. Further, investigation on the effects of temperatures in energy levels and bee-parasite interaction should be conducted at molecular levels with increased sample size. In regards to the fatty acid composition, assessing fatty acid composition in different body parts and using techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to determine actual fluidity of the membranes will provide better insights into the topic. Last but not the least, assessment of acclimation effects on fatty acid composition needs to be rigorously and clearly done over a longer-time period, particularly over generations to get a better understanding into how acclimation to varying temperatures at different time periods affects the fatty acid composition in organisms.

T1  - Investigating the Role of Heat Shock Proteins in the Low Salinity Acclimation of <i>Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis</i>
AN  - 1832047728
AB  - The phylum Echinodermata contains mostly stenohaline organisms. One notable exception is the green sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis,  which acclimates to decreases in salinity caused by freshwater runoff. Although several studies have examined the range and factors that influence this acclimation, the exact molecular mechanism is unknown. In response to other abiotic challenges such as temperature, many organisms upregulate heat shock proteins (HSPs). These proteins bind to unfolded proteins to stabilize them under stressful conditions, which may explain the mechanism behind the salinity tolerance of S. droebachiensis. To test this, tube feet samples from S. droebachiensis were collected from a control environment (10°C, 32-35ppt), and from an experimental environment that experiences periodic fluctuations in salinity (21-35ppt). Relative expression levels of HSP70, HSP60, and HSP90 were examined by immunoblotting. Only HSP70 was detected, and a significant difference was found between sea urchins from the control environment, and sea urchins from the experimental environment.

T1  - Risk of invasion by walnut twig beetle throughout eastern North America
AN  - 1830530108
AB  - The walnut twig beetle (Pityophthorus juglandis Blackman) is a domestic alien invasive bark beetle in the United States of America (USA) that vectors a phytopathogenic fungus. Together, the beetle and fungus cause thousand cankers disease in species of Juglans and Pterocarya. Geographic range expansion by P. juglandis from its native range in the southwestern USA throughout the western United States and isolated areas of the eastern United States provides evidence for human-mediated movement. The disease is now present in more than 120 counties on naïve native and cultivated hosts in the eastern and western USA and in northern Italy. This research describes the cold mortality and host suitability of  P. juglandis.   I measured the cold tolerance of P. juglandis adults and larvae from a northern California population monthly from January 2013 to May 2014. I found significant seasonal changes in adult supercooling points in fall, winter, and spring. I observed a shift in cold-tolerance strategy in P. juglandis adults from freeze-intolerance (December 2013 and January 2014) to partial freeze-tolerance (February 2014). Adults appear to be more cold-hardy than larvae. Predicted winter survivorship in the southeastern USA is higher than in the northeastern USA.   I conducted field and laboratory trials to determine if reproduction by P. juglandis varies between two black walnut ( Juglans nigra L.) parent trees and black walnut and butternut ( Juglans cinerea L.). Fewer adult offspring developed in branch sections of the black walnut maternal ‘Sparrow’ parent than the paternal ‘Schessler’ parent over three summer months and one winter month in the lab. In the field, P. juglandis reproduction in black walnut and butternut did not differ.   In an expanded laboratory study of host suitability, I screened 11  Juglans spp., one Pterocarya sp., and two  Carya spp. over two years. Eleven Juglans and one  Pterocarya species supported complete brood development. J ulgans nigra, J. californica, and J. hindsii had the greatest levels of reproduction. Less suitable hosts include native southwestern United States hosts (J. major and J. microcarpa), Eurasian species (J. regia), Asian butternuts (J. ailantifolia, J. mandshurica, and J. cathayensis), and native eastern United States butternut (J. cinerea) and Japanese walnut-butternut hybrid (J. ailantifolia × cinerea ). The two Carya species were not hosts.   Finally, I present a framework that provides strategies for accessing stakeholder knowledge of unspecified pathways that may move forest insect pests. Using social science, stakeholder analysis, and design principles, the framework provides risk managers a tool to consult stakeholders for pathway information. The result is a list of pathways that can be validated independently.    My research provides biological information of the potentially limiting factors of the spread and establishment of P. juglandis. Although the impacts of thousand cankers disease appear variable, the probability of exposure of walnut to P. juglandis appears to be limited by cold temperatures and host species. The overall risk of P. juglandis  to the eastern United States is not determined by this body of work. The national perception of risk or concern over P. juglandis  to walnut has decreased since I began this dissertation. Despite the shift in national perception, however, the completion of this work provides state and federal regulators information for improved decision-making regarding trapping and monitoring, quarantines, and how to research unspecified pathways of movement.

T1  - Assessing the relative influence of nitrogen deposition and regional warming on scaled chrysophytes in lakes downwind of the Athabasca Oil Sands Region, Canada
AN  - 1825302764
AB  - Freshwater systems in Boreal regions are potentially threatened by a number of environmental stressors, such as point and non-point source pollutants from industrial development and climate change. In northeast Alberta, industrial activity in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) threatens nearby lakes, and potentially lakes downwind. In the late-1990’s rapid annual increases in the mining of bitumen occurred, with corresponding increases in emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides. Recent paleolimnological studies have provided indications of increased primary production in a number of lakes in Alberta and northwest Saskatchewan. Several studies in other regions have linked deposition of reactive nitrogen (Nr) to nutrient enrichment of freshwater ecosystems, and a potential increase in primary producers. However, due to regional warming, the degree to which deposition of Nr to lakes downwind of the AOSR influences primary producers remains unknown.   I investigated the relative influence of climate change and enhanced Nr deposition on scaled-chrysophyte production in northwest Saskatchewan lakes. To disentangle the influence of the two stressors, a paleolimnological assessment of 16 lakes was undertaken. Reference and impact lakes with respect to Nr deposition were chosen, and nutrient limitation was integrated into the study design to identify lake sensitivity to Nr deposition (N or P or co-limited). Scaled-chrysophyte assemblages were dominated by the taxon Mallomonas crassisquama, and little change occurred in species assemblages since  ca 1900. However, recent (post ca 1980) increases in total chrysophyte abundance in cores from both reference and impact sites suggested a regional stressor (i.e. climate) as a driving factor. However, because of the low number of study lakes and small lake environmental gradient, the number of study sites was increased to 26 to further understand chrysophyte response to warming in the region. Breakpoint analysis on scale-to-diatom ratio time series indicated that shallower sites responded earlier than deeper sites. A canonical variate analysis also suggested that the magnitude of response is also lake specific, with low nutrient and deeper lakes showing larger increases in chrysophyte abundance. The results from this study suggest that a) widespread changes in chrysophyte populations are occurring in this region likely in response to warming and its effects on the thermal structure of lakes, and b) physical and chemical characteristics of lakes are important in modulating ecological change.

T1  - Susceptibility and suitability of northeastern North American pines for mountain pine beetle, <i>Dendroctonus ponderosae</i> Hopkins
AN  - 1816971300
AB  - The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) is the most aggressive bark beetle (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in western North America. This insect is currently expanding its range eastward through the Canadian boreal forest. Continued range expansion, or introduction via infested material from western North America, could lead to novel associations between the mountain pine beetle and eastern pines. This research seeks to determine the susceptibility and suitability of pine species common to northeastern North America for mountain pine beetle. Studies were conducted in a common garden environment on logs of four common eastern pines, red (Pinus resinosa), jack (P. banksiana), eastern white (P. strobus) and Scots (P. sylvestris) pine, and two historic hosts, lodgepole (P. contorta) and ponderosa (P. ponderosa) pine.Constitutive defenses pose no significant barrier to colonization of eastern pines by mountain pine beetle. The proportion of female beetles that established fertile egg galleries differed among eastern pines, but were similar to historic hosts. Foraging beetles were generally no more attracted to logs of eastern pines containing boring beetles than to a control. Chemical analysis of the phloem suggests that host kairomones critical for secondary attraction were minimal among novel pines and likely resulting in less attraction than to historic hosts.Overwintering capacity of developing brood was affected by eastern pines. Rapid development in novel pines resulted in greater proportions of brood entering winter in less cold tolerant life stages than historic hosts. The strategy and degree of cold toleranceof fourth in stars were affected by natal pine host. Field validation of logistic regression models demonstrated that models based on the insect freezing temperature underestimate cold mortality, while lower lethal temperature curves more accurately project mortalitydue to cold.Finally, we found that constitutive defenses pose no barrier to reproduction among novel pines. Indeed, novel pines can have up to twice the reproductive potential, and demonstrate greater brood fitness than historic hosts. However, variable rates of development among novel hosts could result in desynchronized or extended emergence periods in mixed stands. Matches between species specific development rates and climate will be crucial for outbreaks to occur in eastern forests.

T1  - The development of polyurethane-based solid-to-solid phase change materials for thermal energy storage applications
AN  - 1816188914
AB  - This work investigated and characterized the structure-property relationship of a polyurethane-based block copolymer and the thermal energy storage properties obtained through the solid-to-solid phase transition of a PCM polyol polymer that undergoes a thermal transition at low temperatures. The chemical and physical factors that influence or dictated the microphase separation between the urethane “hard” segment block and the polyol “soft” segment block of conventional polyurethanes how the resulting changes in phase morphology effects the crystallization behavior of the “soft” component, which in this dissertation is analogous to the PCM polymer component was analyzed. The urethane HS group behaves as a cross-link and restricts PCM polymer chain mobility, thereby the PCM can no longer translate freely and instead exhibits a solid-to-solid phase transition. The introduction of HS cross-link exhibits a behavior known as the HS chain-end effect, in which HS constrictions cause the PCM polymer to become partially crystalline. The extent to which PCM crystallization is limited by the HS chain end effect can vary depending on HS structural factors, such molecular architecture and HS composition. The HS chain end effect was quantified for the following HS structural variables; HS cross-link nature, diisocyanate molecular geometry, HS chain length to characterize and compare how each factor limits PEG PCM polymer crystallization. By doing so in a systematic manner, the optimal configuration for an effective PU-SSPCM can be determined. To examine HS cross-link nature, an analogous linear and a non-linear PU-SSPCM polymer, were compared to determine differences in final thermal energy storage properties. The effects of diisocyanate molecular geometry was investigated by comparing the thermal energy storage properties of a series of PU-SSPCMs varied only by its diisocyanate component. The considered diisocyanates were selected based on specific structural moieties that affect the structural regularity, rigidity, and symmetry of the HS. The chain length of the hard segment component influence on thermal energy storage properties was also investigated by varying the proportions of urethane HS concentration and PCM polymer concentrations. HS cross-link nature, the HS diisocyanate component, and HS chain length are considered chemical level factors since they can be controlled during synthesis. On the physical level, the possibility of a connection between the degree of phase separation and thermal energy storage properties were explored. This relationship was investigated by measuring thermal energy storage properties of PU-SSPCMs with a high, medium, and low degree of phase separation. Varying HS crystallization by cooling rates from a homogeneous melt state was used to obtain different levels of phase separation.    Thermal energy storage properties were measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry experiments. Supplemental information about the chemical structure of the synthesized polyurethane-based solid-to-solid phase change materials (PU-SSPCM) was analyzed by FTIR analysis techniques. The phase morphology and the degree of phase separation prevalent in the prepared samples was characterized by FTIR, TGA, and DSC techniques.

AN  - 1813283894
AB  - Germination has an optimum temperature and minimum and maximum thresholds [hereafter, tolerance range (TR)]. I reasoned that species with limited dispersal would be more specialized to local conditions and have narrower TR than those with wide dispersal. Four species contrasting in dispersal strategies were studied: Penstemon digitalis, P. tubaeflorus (gravity),  Physalis longifolia (animal) and Asclepias syriaca (wind). I hypothesized that TR would differ (narrowest to widest):  Penstemon < Physalis < Asclepias. Seeds were collected from MO to MN; stratified at 1, 5, and 9°C; and incubated at 15/6, 20/10, 25/15, and 30/15ºC. Levins’ B was calculated; values approaching 1 vs. 0 represent a wide vs. narrow TR. Asclepias and Physalis seeds germinated highest at 20/10-30/15°C regardless of stratification temperature, and Penstemon seeds at 15/6-30/15°C following 1°C stratification. TRs for cold-stratified seeds were: Penstemon < Physalis < Asclepias.  Thus, my hypothesis was supported that TR varied according to dispersal strategy.

T1  - Effects of Acclimation on Temperature Tolerance and Oxidative Damage in <i>Daphnia magna</i>
AN  - 1811464538
AB  - Freshwater zooplankton crustacean Daphnia frequently face strong temperature fluctuations in its natural environment, which necessitates adaptive plastic responses. This study focuses on changes in lipid peroxidation and total oxidative capacity in Daphnia tissues in response to long-term and short-term temperature changes. Long-term acclimation to 28ºC helped Daphnia survive longer at lethally high temperatures. This difference, however, was not accompanied by changes in lipid peroxidation, indicating that it isn’t a good measure of damage or predictor of temperature tolerance.   On the other hand, total oxidation capacity was lower 28ºC- than in 18ºC-acclimated Daphnia, suggesting that acclimation resulted in higher amounts of antioxidants in Daphnia tissues. Exposure to hypoxia, known to up-regulate antioxidant pathways in  Daphnia, further elevated heat tolerance in 28ºC- acclimated individuals. Yet, manipulations of glutathione, an important antioxidant, while predictably affecting oxidative capacity, didn’t influence heat tolerance in Daphnia, suggesting that other antioxidants may play a significant role in it.

T1  - Low-temperature tolerance of overwintering white shrimp (<i>Litopenaeus setiferus</i>) in South Carolina
AN  - 1810727803
AB  - Subadult white shrimp, Litopenaeus setiferus, overwinter in estuarine waters, where they are vulnerable to cold kills when water temperature decreases rapidly. This has direct impacts on the season opening and level of harvest of the spring fishery, so proper management of this species requires a thorough understanding of the effects of cold water temperatures on survival. Low-temperature tolerance of overwintering white shrimp collected in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina was determined using three experimental methods: the chronic lethal method (CLM), the acclimated chronic exposure (ACE) method with static temperatures, and the ACE method with fluctuating temperatures. These methods all use an environmentally realistic temperature decline of 1° C/day. Using the CLM, shrimp exposed to constantly declining temperatures (n=133) were found to experience loss of equilibrium at a mean temperature (± SD) of 6.87° C ± 1.50° C and mortality at a mean temperature of 3.82°C ± 0.54°C. The ACE method, which uses changing temperatures until a base temperature is reached, was used to evaluate how white shrimp were affected by exposure to prolonged (10-d), sub-lethal temperatures, and daily temperature fluctuations characteristic of estuarine environments. The ACE method was performed with both static and fluctuating temperatures, at three base temperatures (8.5° C, 7° C, and 5.5° C). Shrimp exposed to static temperatures of 8.5° C, 7° C, and 5.5° C (n=72, n=67, n=71) had significantly different survival rates (P < 0.001), with 10% , 24%, and 99% mortality respectively. Temperature fluctuations around both an 8.5° C and 7° C base temperature did not significantly affect time until loss of equilibrium or mortality compared to the static treatment at the same base temperatures; however temperature fluctuations caused significantly higher mortality for the 5.5° C base temperature (P < 0.0001). These data will be used to develop predictive mortality estimates for overwintering subadult white shrimp (80-110 mm) and will validate the use of temperature as a proxy for mortality in current management practices.

T1  - Development of Mutant Transferrin-Based Molecular Conjugates and Polypeptide-Based Gold Nanoshells as Targeted Drug Carriers for Cancer Therapy
AN  - 1804413328
AB  - Currently, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, only behind heart disease. Current treatments of cancer include radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and they are often nonspecific, leading to undesired short and long term side effects. In order to improve current treatments and to reduce side effects, researchers have been investigating alternative methods that can increase the specificity of treatments towards tumor cells to reduce the damage to normal cells. This thesis presents two alternative therapeutic formulations that have increased specificity towards tumor cells. These two therapeutic formulations show potential as alternative methods for cancer therapy in the future.    Human glycoprotein transferrin (Tf), which is responsible for transporting iron into cells, has been extensively studied as a tumor-selective targeting ligand since the tumor cells overexpress the transferrin receptor (TfR) in order to support its rapid proliferation rate. However, the short duration of the Tf-TfR trafficking pathway limits the window of opportunity for Tf to function as a drug carrier. In order to increase the cellular association of Tf, our laboratory previously demonstrated that two Tf mutants (K206E/R632A Tf and K206E/R534A Tf) exhibit significant increases in cellular association compared to wild-type Tf. Subsequently, our laboratory showed that these Tf mutants conjugated with diphtheria toxin (DT) have improved drug carrier efficacy relative to the wild-type Tf-DT conjugate in HeLa and glioma cells. However, due to DT’s nonspecific toxicity at off-target sites, DT is not suitable for clinical applications. In Chapter 2 of this thesis, DT was substituted with cross-reacting material 107 (CRM107), a DT mutant with significantly decreased nonspecific toxicity. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments were conducted where the Tf-CRM107 conjugates were incubated with HeLa and glioma cells. These experiments demonstrated that the improvement in efficacy was greater between the mutant Tf-CRM107 conjugates and the wild-type Tf-CRM107 conjugate when compared to similar experiments performed with their DT counterparts. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxicity experiments with non-neoplastic cells demonstrated that cancer selectivity can be achieved with these new mutant and wild-type Tf-CRM107 conjugates due to the IC50 values being significantly higher for the normal cells. These results suggest that CRM107 appears to be a more suitable therapeutic agent in combination with the K206E/R632A and K206E/R534A mutant Tf ligands for future in vivo  and clinical studies.    In addition to using molecular conjugates to kill cancer cells, laser-induced photothermal therapy has shown promise as an alternative method for cancer therapy. Photothermal therapy requires the use of a photosensitizer,  i.e., a material that has the ability to convert electromagnetic energy into thermal energy, and a molecular targeting ligand for cancer therapy. In Chapter 3 of this thesis, we describe how we combined an engineered prostate cancer-specific targeting ligand, the A11 minibody, with a novel photothermal therapy agent, polypeptide-based gold nanoshells that generate heat in response to near infrared light. Our work demonstrated that the A11 minibody binds strongly to the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) that is overexpressed on the surfaces of metastatic prostate cancer cells. Compared to non-conjugated gold nanoshells, the A11 minibody-conjugated gold nanoshell exhibited significant laser-induced, localized killing of prostate cancer cells in vitro.  In addition, we improved upon a comprehensive heat transfer mathematical model that was previously developed by our laboratory. By relaxing some of the assumptions of our earlier model, we were able to generate more accurate predictions. In the future, this model can be used to predict the effects of varying parameters in order to design the next generation of gold nanoshells for photothermal therapy. Our experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the potential of our novel minibody-conjugated gold nanoshells for metastatic prostate cancer therapy.

T1  - Geographic range limits in salamanders: Interactions between physiological and behavioral systems
AN  - 1803627564
AB  - Understanding the relationship between species distributions and their underlying mechanisms is a major question in ecology and evolutionary biology. The mechanisms involved and the degree to which they affect distributions vary among and within species. Examining the diversity of these mechanisms through behavioral, physiological, and integrative approaches can further our knowledge of the evolution of such traits and the maintenance of biodiversity and geographic distributions. Many of these traits may be conserved after speciation, therefore examination should be thorough, involve many species, and incorporate a phylogenetic approach.   The salamanders in the genus Plethodon are an ideal system to test predictions about mechanisms limiting geographic distributions and permitting species coexistence. In the laboratory, they acclimate quickly and exhibit realistic behaviors, and have been important models for understanding biotic interactions in the field. Furthermore, they are particularly sensitive to abiotic conditions because of they are lungless and rely on cutaneous respiration, coupled with maintaining a fully terrestrial lifestyle.   Four experimental studies that examine the thermal sensitivity of behavior and physiology of species in the genus Plethodon are reported in my dissertation. First, I determined the thermal sensitivity of aggression between two sympatric species. Second, I examined how energy assimilation differs intraspecifically in respect to geographic gradients. Third, I explored energy assimilation at the population level between different color morphs of a polymorphic species. Lastly, I explored interspecifically how thermal metrics of energy assimilation are related to range size.   I found that aggression increased with increasing temperatures and that thermal sensitivity of aggression differed depending on species. Within a species, latitudinal gradients, but not elevational gradients, produced different thermal sensitivities. Within a single population, energy assimilation did not differ between color morphs. Lastly, I found that thermal optimum and thermal performance breadth were correlated with latitude and elevation among species of Plethodon.   The research that I have conducted has given valuable insight in to the physiology and behavior of a highly specious genus. The data within this dissertation should be most useful in other contexts, particularly the production of data intensive mechanistic models of species distributions.

T1  - Sexual conflict and chemical communication in hybridizing harvester ants
AN  - 1796054282
AB  - Sexual conflict occurs when the fitness interests of males and females do not align with one another. The resolution of sexual conflict often depends on the level of control each sex has on the behavior in conflict. In  Pogonomyrmex harvester ants with a genetically determined caste system, two separate lineages interbreed with one another during summer mating swarms. Diploid offspring sired by a single lineage develop into reproductive queens, while offspring sired by opposite-lineage parents develop into sterile workers. This results in sexual conflict, as males which mate with opposite lineage queens will produce only workers, resulting in no fitness benefit, while queens must mate with opposite-lineage males in order to obtain workers and survive. Despite these fitness differences, males do not discriminate between lineages prior to mating. One possible reason for the lack of male discrimination is that queens “mask” their identity cues, making discrimination difficult for males. In eusocial insects, identity cues are encoded by cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC’s) found on the exoskeleton of the insects. These cues contain information on the insect’s reproductive status, sex, species, state, and nest membership. In addition to their communication functions, CHC’s also serve as desiccation-resistance molecules, preventing water from freely passing out of the cuticle. However, molecules that are best-suited for communication functions are poor desiccation resistance molecules, and molecules that are best-suited for waterproofing lack the diversity needed for communication; therefore, a tradeoff between these two functions is expected.    In this dissertation, I explore sexual conflict in these ants and the chemical recognition cues that likely play a role in this conflict. To test for cryptic strategies in harvester ant mating swarms, I experimentally paired males and females from two interbreeding lineages of harvester ant with different fitness outcomes based on pairing, and measured the propensity to initiate copulation, pre-copulatory time, time in copula, and rate and amount of sperm transferred in each mating. Although females controlled copulation duration, males altered sperm transfer rates, resulting in no quantitative difference in total sperm transfer between lineages. To test for thermal constraints on the diversity and composition of cuticular hydrocarbon profiles, and changes in CHC profiles that occur in workers isolated from the queen, I surveyed the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of a species complex of harvester ants. The CHC profiles of ants from more xeric environments showed evidence of constraints, while isolated workers differentiated from their queen-raised sisters, although not in queen-specific molecules. To test for queen identity masking and lack of discrimination ability in mating swarms, I tested for convergence in the CHC profiles of reproductives in two hybridizing lineages in response to the sexual conflict playing out in this species. Differences in CHC profiles were lost during the mating swarm, likely limiting male ability to discriminate between mates, limiting discrimination ability in mating swarms. To study the genetic regions that control CHC production, I created a physical linkage map of two of the interbreeding populations, and used that map to perform quantitative trait loci analysis on the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of recombinant males. One significant region associated with 13-methylnonacosane contained numerous odorant receptor genes, suggesting a link between that CHC production and the receptors that detect it, while a second region associated with n-pentacosane contained numerous genes that control expression levels. Overall, the genetic caste determination system in these ants leads to antagonistic coevolution between species. This coevolution is likely reinforced by the thermal constraints and exchange of recognition cues between species, lowering the ability of useful discrimination between lineages during mating swarms.

T1  - Predictable Change of Unpredictable Magnitude: Understanding the Importance of Stochastic Thermal Environments on the Physiology of an Intertidal Limpet
AN  - 1796032812
AB  - Much of our understanding of the thermal physiology of intertidal organisms comes from experiments with animals acclimated under constant conditions and exposed to a single heat stress. In nature, however, the thermal environment is much more complex. Aerial exposure and the unpredictable nature of thermal stress during low tides could be critical factors in defining the thermal physiology of intertidal organisms. In the fingered limpet, Lottia digitalis, we investigated how repeated heat stress of constant and predictable magnitude vs. that which is stochastic and unpredictable in nature modulated upper temperature tolerance and temperature sensitivity as measured by cardiac performance following two weeks of acclimation. We also investigated differences in cellular metabolism and damage for insights into biochemical mechanisms of tolerance. Upper temperature tolerance increased with aerial exposure, but no significant differences were found between predictable treatments of varying magnitudes (24°C vs. 32°C). Significant differences were found between unpredictable trials with different heating patterns. We found no differences among treatments in basal citrate synthase activity, glycogen content, oxidative stress, or antioxidants. Our results suggest that recent thermal history paired with relief from high low tide temperatures are important factors modulating the capacity of limpets to deal with thermal stress.

T1  - Thermal acclimation dynamics of the Atlantic stingray, <i> Dasyatis sabina</i>
AN  - 1783126709
AB  - Thermal acclimation responses of Atlantic stingrays, Dasyatis sabina, were determined by reciprocal transfer of fish between 18 and 24°C or 24 and 30°C. The acclimation response ratio of fully acclimated fish showed that Atlantic stingrays gain or lose approximately 0.5°C of their thermal tolerance for every degree increase or decrease in acclimation temperature, respectively. Predictive models of thermal tolerance change over time (measured as Critical Thermal Maxima) suggest that stingrays are 75% acclimated by 9.5 days regardless of temperature transfer, or direction of temperature change. The largest acclimation changes were seen during initial transfers indicating an asymmetrical tolerance pattern, whereby stingrays gained or lost approximately twice the heat tolerance at lower transfer temperatures (1824°C) compared to the higher transfer treatments (2430°C). This novel pattern of asymmetric heat tolerance acquisition may be a key adaptation necessary for surviving rapid and extreme water temperature changes Atlantic stingrays commonly experience in their natural environment.

T1  - The mechanisms and consequences of phenological evolution
AN  - 1767456722
AB  - Phenological shifts are clearly biologically important as they contribute to both ecological speciation and persistence during global warming. However, the genetic and physiological mechanisms behind shifts remain unclear. This is due to complicated genetic and genomic bases, as well as the cryptic nature of the phenotype. The consequences of phenological shifts also remain largely unexplored. We expect that a novel temporal habitat will have a different thermal profile than the ancestral habitat due to seasonal thermal variation. Therefore, for successful phenological shifts we predict correlated evolution in thermal tolerance. My dissertation investigates both the mechanisms and evolutionary consequences of phenological shifts, and adds to a growing body of literature on these topics.    I first investigate the physiological mechanism underlying evolution in life-history timing of corn borers. Using metabolic trajectories, I find that variation in the length of the diapause termination phase underlies an ~30-day shift observed in seasonal timing between E and Z-strains. While the E-strain exits diapause within 7 days, the Z-strain remains in diapause termination for ∼30 more days.    These metabolic trajectories are further used to target days for whole transcriptome profiling to nominate molecular mechanisms for the shift in timing. I nominate 48 candidate genes within the quantitative trait locus (QTL) for seasonal timing, and find that shorter E-strain termination is defined by a burst of genome-wide transcriptional activity involved in cell cycling, the stress response, and hormone production.    I next interrogate the genomic architecture surrounding the QTL for differences in seasonal timing. I investigate if a chromosomal inversion could be present near the QTL for timing as previous studies found evidence of a large region of suppressed recombination in this region. Our results confirm that there is evidence for a large-scale rearrangement covering at least 20% of the Z (sex) chromosome that harbors the basis for seasonal timing differences.    A final study looks at the consequences for evolved differences in seasonal timing between corn borer strains. As shifts in phenology displace populations across a season, they also expose populations to novel thermal environments. I find that earlier-emergence from winter diapause is correlated with enhanced cold-tolerance.

T1  - Coral-algal symbioses: Consequences of flexibility in symbiont uptake for newly settled coral recruits and juveniles
AN  - 1766589657
AB  - Our understanding of coral reefs and their fate in a changing climate has been expanded by our ability to monitor the diversity and abundance of the algal endosymbionts, Symbiodinium, that sustain them. For many coral species, the obligate association with members of the phylogenetically and physiologically diverse genus Symbiodinium is established anew each generation whereby a diversity of Symbiodinium species are initially taken up, but winnowed down over time to a predictable assemblage found in adult corals. This dissertation research includes ecological and genetic studies to monitor patterns of symbiont uptake and retention for newly settled Orbicella faveolata and Briareum asbestinum  and to consider the consequences of flexibility and diversity in symbiont uptake on host growth, survival, and nutrient acquisition. We found that:   1.) The timing of exposure to environmental symbionts altered  Symbiodinium uptake in aposymbiotic and laboratory inoculated  O. faveolata juveniles. This emphasized the beneficial role of early exposure to Symbiodinium, demonstrated a coral’s ability to continue symbiont uptake for many months following settlement, and highlighted the ability of natural strains to displace laboratory inoculates upon exposure to natural seawater.   2.) The identity of the Symbiodinium (A1 or B1) taken up by newly settled O. faveolata in the laboratory resulted in differences in host fitness proxies including growth but not survivorship or thermal tolerance. These experiments showed that Symbiodinium species have unique photosynthetic characteristics based on PAM Fluorometry data with Symbiodinium A1 shown to use the available light less efficiently relative to Symbiodinium B1. Despite this difference, coral polyps harboring Symbiodinium A1 grew more quickly and to larger sizes, an important demonstration that variation in symbiont quality goes beyond relative differences in photophysiology.   3.) Symbiont uptake in B. asbestinum varied with the presence of single vs. multiple symbiont types with evidence of competitive exclusion. The amount of available light modulated these interactions with some species of symbionts being excluded more often in low light environments. Overtime, the symbiont assemblages became more variable and symbionts seemed to loose their competitive edge suggesting that this initial difference in colonization ability may not have long lasting effects.   4.) The presence and relative abundance of two species of symbionts in  B. asbestinum, Symbiodinium A1 and B1 influenced the acquisition rate of carbon and nitrogen by the symbionts and the translocation of those nutrients to the host. These results demonstrated physiological differences between symbiont species. Furthermore, there was some evidence of competitive interactions among symbionts with carbonate fixation being lower than expected for mixed in hospite Symbiodinium assemblages. However, complex ecological interactions among symbionts and between the host and symbionts were difficult to tease apart.   Overall these findings confirm the importance of Symbiodinium  identity on host phenotype. Flexibility and turn over in symbiont associations may provide long-lived hosts with an additional level of adaptation by which corals can alter their phenotype by altering their associated symbionts We found that transitions between dominant symbiont types can occur at various points in the early stages of the symbiosis but that these transitions may have negative consequences where hosts cannot prevent associations with sub-optimal or competitive species of Symbiodinium.

T1  - Plasticity of the Heat Shock Response and Development of Thermotolerance During Embryonic Development of Lake Whitefish (<em>Coregonus clupeaformis</em>)
AN  - 2434044354
AB  - Thermal discharge produced by industrial facilities has the potential to impact development of fish by increasing background temperature of the surrounding area. The overall objectives of this study were to: 1) Examine the interplay between how temperature and frequency of heat shock and post-heat shock recovery time can modulate the heat shock response to a subsequent more severe stressor; 2) determine if this interplay is the same at different embryonic stages; and 3) assess whether transient heat shocks confer protection to the embryo. These objectives were addressed by exposing embryos to repeated transient heat shocks and high-level heat shocks and then quantifying heat shock protein mRNA levels and whole animal responses such as, percent survival, time to hatch and morphometrics. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR revealed that transient heat shocks increased or attenuated the heat shock response to severe heat shock depending on the post-transient recovery period. The most frequent transient heat shocks, every 3 days, had the lowest levels of hsp70 mRNA of all heat shock treatments. Embryonic stages had similar results, however, it seemed older embryos had a larger capacity to respond to heat shock as determined by greater increases in heat shock protein mRNA levels. Transient heat shock regimes were also able to confer protection to embryos exposed to a severe 4 h +18 °C high-level heat shock. In general, transient heat shock regimes seem to have some benefit to the embryo allowing for a quicker response to stress and therefore, greater tolerance.

T1  - The physiological viability of bathymetric range shifts in marine ectotherms
AN  - 2193155577
AB  - Organisms occupying an environment where change is occurring must move, acclimatise, or adapt in order to prevent extinction. Despite recent evidence, the potential for species to change their distribution range across depths is regularly overlooked as an alternative to well documented latitudinal shifts. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the physiological viability of bathymetric range shifts by assessing the impacts of elevated hydrostatic pressure (HP) and changing temperature in two marine ectotherms: the shallow-water caridean shrimp Palaemonetes varians; and the continental slope-depth anomuran crab Lithodes maja. Gene biomarkers were characterised in both species and their transcriptional regulation was assessed by qPCR. Acute and long-term exposures revealed that elevated HP produced significant perturbations at the transcriptional level in P. varians, and were corroborated by measurements of behaviour and respiratory response. HP-associated pathologies were exacerbated by decreasing temperature, and ameliorated by increasing temperature. Results gave a novel insight into the hierarchy and kinetics of HP-induced stress responses, and suggested that the combination of HP and temperature, in part, determines the physiological limitations to bathymetric migration in shallow-water ectotherms. To further test the role of HP and temperature in setting depth distribution limits, gene biomarkers were characterised in a continental slope-depth crab Lithodes maja. Transcriptional regulation and respiration rate was quantified throughout larval ontogeny, and in mature adults. Early life stages showed HP tolerance beyond that of the species natural distribution limits. The observed HP tolerance window reduced through ontogeny. Reductions in HP tolerance with life stage may be analogous to established thermal tolerance reductions with ontogeny. Further, sustained HP exposures suggest that bathymetric range limits in L. maja are constrained by increased metabolic costs, nervous system sensitivities, and macromolecular damage under elevated HP. HP and temperature, and particularly the combination of the two, play an important role in setting the depth distribution limits of marine ectotherms. For temperate shallow-water adapted marine ectotherms, water temperatures towards the upper limit of their thermal scope may facilitate bathymetric range shifts, whilst colder waters further exacerbate the negative physiological effects of elevated HP. Bathymetric range shifts may, under certain scenarios, offer an important, yet underestimated, alternative to latitudinal shifts in light of contemporary climate change. Further, the combination of HP and temperature may have played an important role in the colonisation of the deep sea from shallow waters by marine ectotherms.

T1  - The Influence of Flow Alteration on Instream Habitat and Fish Assemblages
AN  - 2068215168
AB  - Globally, the instream habitat and biotic community of riverine systems are declining. The primary threat to rivers is flow regime alteration through dams, landscape alteration, and climate change. The natural flow regime is the natural pattern of a rivers flow. The flow regime is vital for maintaining abiotic and biotic stream components, including the thermal regime of rivers (i.e., average, maximum and minimum temperature). Increased stream temperature can influence species direct and indirect survival, as well as many life history events. The objectives of my Master’s research were to 1) develop flow-ecology relationships for stream habitat and fishes from the Arbuckle Mountain and Ozark Highland ecoregion and 2) determine the maximum thermal tolerance of stream fishes from the Arbuckle Mountains. Flow-ecology relationships were determined through the development of linear models for both stream habitat (i.e., deposited sediment, channel-unit diversity, residual-pool depth, and bankfull width-to-depth ratio) and fish assemblages (i.e., coarse-scale reproductive guilds and finer-scale reproductive-taxonomy guilds) to determine their relationship with flow alteration. These flow-ecology models showed that many stream abiotic and biotic characteristics were positively influenced by dynamic flow conditions, such as, increased magnitude and number of reversals. For example, stream fish diversity and reproductive guild diversity were positively influenced by increased maximum flows. Abiotic and biotic flow-ecology relationships can further improve the development of environmental-flow standards. I also determined the critical thermal maxima (CTM) of 15 species and the longer-term tolerance of 10 fish species from the Arbuckle Mountains. Longer-term studies had both a spring-fed and non spring-fed treatment that mimicked the thermal regime of Arbuckle Mountain streams. Comparing the results of the CTM and the longer-term study improves our understanding of species thermal tolerance and acclimation ability. Results showed that pelagic species had higher thermal tolerances than benthic species and had greater acclimation ability. Results from both objectives provide insight on the susceptibility of species to future flow and thermal alterations. This can be used to predict future fish assemblage changes and determine species of conservation concern.

T1  - Evaluation of a Fungal Entomopathogen for Malaria Mosquito Control, with an Emphasis on Temperature
AN  - 1912798255
AB  - Malaria remains one of the most significant vector-borne diseases worldwide. One of the cheapest, most effective ways of controlling malaria is by targeting the anopheline mosquitoes which transmit it. This is primarily accomplished via the use of chemical insecticides, which may be integrated into bed nets or applied as spray treatments to indoor walls. However, wild mosquitoes are rapidly evolving resistance to all four classes of chemicals currently approved for indoor use, spurring research to identify new control technologies.   Fungal entomopathogens are one such tool. Fungal spores act as contact pesticides and may be deployed in a manner similar to chemicals. While chemicals are selected to kill or knock down mosquitoes within hours of exposure, fungal entomopathogens may require a week or more to kill exposed mosquitoes. However, the parasite which causes malaria also requires at least nine days to mature within the vector before it can be transmitted to a new host, and both this extrinsic incubation period and mosquito survival time following fungal exposure are strongly dependent on environmental temperature. Because little was known about the relationship between temperature and fungal virulence (defined here as rate of kill), we evaluated virulence of the candidate fungal biopesticide  Beauveria bassiana in anopheline mosquitoes across the range of temperatures relevant for malaria transmission. We found that the fungus consistently killed the vast majority of mosquitoes before they would have been expected to begin transmitting malaria (i.e. in a shorter period of time than the malarial extrinsic incubation period). This result was robust across different diets (mosquitoes fed exclusively on sugar vs. blood fed), species (Anopheles stephensi  and Anopheles gambiae) and levels of diurnal temperature variation (±0°C, ±6°C). We also evaluated the fungus in mosquitoes infected with malaria but found no evidence of an effect of fungal co- or superinfection on malaria infection parameters or on mosquito mortality rate. Theoretical modeling predicted that realistic levels of fungal coverage could deliver significant reductions in infectious adult mosquito population density. When combined with mean temperature data from across Africa, our results suggested that, if fungus was deployed at sufficiently high coverage levels, temperature would have a limited impact on the ability of this biopesticide to suppress malaria-infectious mosquito populations.   We parameterized our model based on data collected at constant temperatures. However, temperatures in the field tend to vary even over the course of a single day. Because mosquitoes are small-bodied ectotherms, their body temperature and the temperature of the pathogens they carry will vary along with the temperature in their environment. Because organismal performance tends to be nonlinearly related to temperature, it has long been recognized that performance rates under constant temperatures may not be equivalent to those under fluctuating conditions, a phenomenon known as the Kaufmann effect. While this is often accounted for by summing incremental rates over the range of temperatures experienced, there are indications that this rate summation technique does not always accurately predict the impacts of realistic levels of diurnal temperature variation. We tested the accuracy of rate summation by measuring  in vitro radial growth rate of B. bassiana at constant temperatures to create a thermal performance norm curve. We then used rate summation to predict the impacts of diurnal temperature variation and tested these predictions empirically. We found that the accuracy of rate summation depended both on mean temperature and on the patterns of diurnal temperature variation. At moderate levels of variation, rate summation was accurate, but at high levels, rate summation overestimated performance at the warm end of the curve. We also found that initial growth conditions significantly affected estimates of the critical thermal maximum, or the temperature above which no growth should occur. Acute exposure to temperatures above the critical thermal maximum paused growth in a time- and temperature-dependent manner, but once growth resumed, growth rate was not significantly different from controls in the majority of treatments.   Based on these results, we concluded that fungal biopesticides have the potential to significantly reduce infectious mosquito density and that, based on the results of our rate summation experiment, our modeling predictions regarding malaria mosquito control likely underestimate fungal impact under more realistic fluctuating temperature conditions.

T1  - Comportement d'établissement du Homard américain (<i>Homarus americanus</i>): Effet de l'origine des femelles et de la température de développement
AN  - 1884808867
AB  - The benthic settlement success of American lobster (Homarus americanus ) postlarvae (stage IV larvae) is a key factor in population dynamics. Water temperature is a factor that may limit the settlement of postlarvae, particularly the presence of a strong vertical thermal stratification. The spatial distribution of this species allows its pelagic larvae to encounter, during development, heterogeneous thermal zones. Little information is available on the ability to acclimate to temperature or on the occurrence of local adaptation for the American lobster, depending on the geographical area. In this context, the main objectives of this thesis were to characterize 1) the settlement behavior of the postlarvae in relation to the incubation temperature and the geographical origin of the females and2) the behavioral responses of postlarvae in the absence/presence of a thermocline. This study involved, rearing of larvae from hatching to the postlarval stage, behavioral observations of the postlarvae with video recording and hepatopancreas lipid analysis of the postlarvae. Our results do not support the hypothesis of a local thermal adaptation for the American lobster since no significant difference in the settlement behavior of postlarvae was observed in relation to the origin of the females. The results show a significant effect of developmental temperature on larval survival and settlement behavior as well as on energetic conditions of the postlarvae. Behavioral plasticity in benthic settlement has been demonstrated in the different thermal water column conditions used. This study may underline links between developmental temperature and the natural variability in survival and settlement of American lobsters. The findings emphasize the need for an integrated approach on the study of lobster recruitment, where the interactions between environmental fluctuations and behavioral plasticity are considered. The inclusion of these variables in dispersion models of lobster larvae should be an important step to improve the understanding of the population structure of the American lobster and to manage its fisheries.

T1  - Does the goldfish COX4-1 gene promoter possess cold-responsive elements?
AN  - 1823609239
AB  - Mitochondrial biogenesis permits tissues to increase mitochondrial content in response to environmental and physiological stressors. In many species of fish mitochondrial biogenesis is triggered by cold exposure. The greater capacity to produce ATP may compensate for energy shortages when body temperature decreases. In goldfish, cold acclimation increases COX activity (and content), paralleled by increases in COX4-1 transcript levels. These transcriptional changes are accompanied by increases in nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) mRNA and nuclear protein levels. Since NRF-1 regulates mitochondrial biogenesis in mammals, my thesis explored whether the increase in NRF-1 caused the change in COX4-1 mRNA that is associated with mitochondrial biogenesis. I used reporter genes under the control of the goldfish COX4-1 proximal promoter to characterize the COX4-1 gene in an effort to identify cold responsive elements. Preliminary analysis of the promoter sequence suggested that there was a putative NRF-1 site at -444/-414 on the proximal promoter, and a second putative NRF-1 element in the 5’UTR. I created a series of reporters that differed in length and analyzed these promoters in several cell types. In mouse myoblasts (C2C12), a decrement in promoter activity was seen when a critical region from 230 bp to 159 bp was deleted. In C2C12 myotubes, deletion of a region of the promoter from -452 to -312 led to a 30% loss in activity. The 1592bp reporter gene transfected into rainbow trout gonad (RTG-2) cells was unaffected by deletions until shortened to 114 bp, and promoter activity was not affected by temperature. When plasmids were transfected into goldfish white muscle, no increase in luciferase expression was seen in cold-acclimated fish that showed a 6.5-fold increase in COX4-1 mRNA. This goldfish in vivo model also created an opportunity to determine if species that differ in thermal tolerance possessed promoters that differed in thermal sensitivity. COX4-1 promoters from the eurythermal goldfish and the stenothermal zebrafish showed the same magnitude of change in promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was conducted on goldfish white muscle to assess if acclimation affected the amount of NRF-1 bound to the COX4-1 promoter. I saw no significant change in binding of NRF-1 to the promoter. While I found no evidence of NRF-1 binding to the proximal promoter of COX4-1, it remains possible that the up-regulation of COX4-1 transcript is a result of NRF-1 binding to an upstream distal promoter region or in an indirect manner through regulating other transcription factors.

T1  - The responses of subtropical nearshore fishes to climate change
AN  - 1818738661
AB  - The purpose of this aspect of the study was to assess the relative impacts of climate-related challenges across seasons on fishes that inhabit the nearshore ecosystem. To do this, blood-based physiological responses to elevated temperature, salinity, acidity, and temperature + acidity of adult bonefish, adult checkered puffer, and juvenile yellowfin mojarra were compared across seasons (i.e., summer and winter). Bonefish exposed to climate-related challenges experienced elevated Cl-, Ca2+, lactate, and glucose levels in the summer relative to winter, and elevated temperature resulted in glucose and ionic disturbances in both seasons. Similarly, independent of season, checkered puffer exhibited elevated hematocrit, glucose, and cortisol levels when exposed to elevated temperature relative to ambient conditions. Yellowfin mojarra experienced minimal physiological disturbance to the climate-related challenges, but independent of season, elevated temperature increased hematocrit values relative to ambient conditions. Interestingly, the combined stressor, temperature + acidity, did not result in a synergistic or additive physiological disturbance in nearshore fishes. Results indicate that adult bonefish exposed to climate-related challenges experience the greatest physiological disturbances in the summer relative to the winter, with temperature being the most challenging stressor. Collectively, temperature change will be the most challenging climate-related stressor for nearshore fishes, particularly in the summer, and may result in more energy being expended to maintain homeostasis.   The purpose of this aspect of the study was to define the performance of subtropical nearshore fishes to projected climate change scenarios and relate these findings to the ecology of nearshore ecosystem in the future. Adult bonefish, adult checkered puffer, juvenile yellowfin mojarra and juvenile schoolmaster snapper, were acclimated to ambient conditions, along with a range of elevated pCO2, salinity, and temperatures that coincide with, or exceed, the worst-case scenario predicted by the IPCC in 100 years. Post acclimation, fish performance was quantified by measuring standard metabolic rate (SMR) with intermittent-flow, static respirometry, and by chasing the fish to exhaustion (i.e., swimming performance (SP)). Bonefish and yellowfin mojarra experienced an increase in SMR of more than 65% when acclimated to seawater at 33ºC, and all species experienced an increase in SMR and a decrease in SP at 34ºC. Nearshore fishes acclimated to elevated pCO 2 and salinity experienced minimal disturbances in SMR or SP. Results indicate that elevated temperatures that coincide with (33ºC), or exceed (34ºC), the worst-case scenario predicted by the IPCC increased standard metabolic rates and reduced swimming performance for a number of nearshore fishes, with elevated pCO2 and salinity resulting in minimal disturbances in performance. To avoid costs associated with elevated temperatures, nearshore fishes may choose to migrate to more thermally stable environments, allocate energy differently, or increase feeding rates to meet energetic demands.   The goal of this aspect of the study was to assess the vulnerability of nearshore fishes to climate change and to evaluate the ability of these fishes to adjust their physiological limits across seasons (i.e., phenotypic plasticity). To do this, the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and minimum (CTMin) of adult bonefish, adult checkered puffer, juvenile yellowfin mojarra, and juvenile schoolmaster snapper were determined across seasons. Acclimatization response ratios (AZRR; ΔCTMax ΔT-1 and ΔCTMin ΔT-1) were typically greater than 0.60 for all species, a value greater than most previously reported for fish species from variable thermal environments. Present day maximum and minimum temperatures in the nearshore environment are approximately equal to or exceed the thermal tolerance limits of the fish in this study, making thermal safety margins (TSM) very small or even negative for nearshore fishes (TSM upper = −4.9–0.5; lower = −0.2–0.4). The thermal landscape in the nearshore ecosystem in the future will likely benefit species with positive thermal safety margins that are capable of acclimatizing (e.g., schoolmaster snapper) while relatively intolerant species (e.g., bonefish) may select habitats in this ecosystem less frequently or will be absent from this ecosystem in the future.   The purpose of this aspect of the study was to define the relative cost of habitat selection by measuring temperature and pCO2 avoidance thresholds of nearshore fishes under altered abiotic conditions in the presence or absence of a predator, (i.e., a juvenile lemon shark). To do this, common subtropical nearshore fishes (i.e., juvenile schoolmaster snapper, juvenile yellowfin mojarra, adult bonefish, and adult checkered puffer) were acclimated to a behavioral choice arena (i.e., two chambers connected by a central corridor). Temperature or CO2 were manipulated in one chamber while the other chamber was maintained at ambient conditions. Results show that elevated temperatures and pCO2 alter habitat choice in all nearshore fishes in this study, and that temperature and pCO2 avoidance thresholds increase in the presence of a predator.

T1  - Processes and Modeling of Temperature Sensitivity of Soil Organic Matter Decomposition in Subtropical Wetlands
AN  - 1786633821
AB  - Wetlands play a pivotal role in global carbon (C) dynamics by sequestering a significant amount of global C, while simultaneously serving as the largest single natural source of CH4. Wetlands are vulnerable to lose stored C if climate warms, yet radiative forcing of global wetlands is poorly represented in climate models. Estimates of gaseous C fluxes in northern wetlands are heavily based on temperature, however, in warmer wetlands, temperature effects on anaerobic C processing are known to interact with substrate quality and nutrients. Additionally, several long-term warming studies in uplands have documented the attenuation of warming response of soil respiration over time. Some argued that it stemmed from the loss of the labile substrates, others indicated that adjustments of microbial physiology (i.e. CUE, carbon use efficiency) might play a role. Recent developments of organic matter decomposition models for uplands also highlighted the importance of measuring extracellular enzymes as a function of temperature, as these are the proximate agents of soil organic matter decomposition.Therefore, a detailed study on C cycling in warmer wetlands is crucial in order to improve our understanding of climate effects on the net ecosystem C balance of wetlands. This study investigated the interactive effects of warming with other environmental drivers (C quality and nutrients) on anaerobic C cycling with special reference to thermal acclimation of microbial and enzyme processes and modeling decomposition. The study site was the Water Conservation Area 2-A (Everglades, Florida), a Peat-based subtropical wetland ecosystem.First, a pilot study was conducted to assess the effect of C quality and nutrient availability on organic matter decomposition as a function of stepwise temperature increase of subtropical peat soils. The warming response of decomposition showed greater interaction with C quality than nutrient availability. Increased decomposition at higher temperature was associated with increased availability of labile C. Our observation of increased C availability with warming is in contrast to many studies in uplands where substrate limitation results into thermal acclimation of decomposition, suggesting a possible association with alteration in microbial CUE. Additionally, nutrient parameters dominantly control decomposition rates at higher temperature end, highlighting a need for careful evaluation of enzyme kinetics.The preliminary findings helped us design an experiment to assess how thermal acclimation of microbial CUE and enzyme kinetics affect decomposition. The extent of thermal acclimation was tested by employing contrasting warming rates and monitoring of CO2 and CH4 production, CUE, and enzyme kinetics. Greater CUE and MBC in the slow warming treatment increased overall decomposition, where the effect of warming rate was more pronounced in recalcitrant and nutrient limited soils. However, global warming potential was greater in the step warming treatment. Contrasting warming rates also altered microbial biomass stoichiometry that regulates expressions of hydrolytic enzymes. Activity (higher Vmax) and efficiency (lower Km) of C vs. nutrients and nitrogen (N) vs. phosphorus (P) related enzymes were greater in the fast-warming treatment. Stable C isotopes of CH4 and CO2, enzyme Km values, and biomass stoichiometry values further indicated the likelihood of altered microbial identity under contrasting warming rates. Thus, two different but apparently stable endpoints under contrasting warming rates resembles to the concepts of alternate stable states. This observation highlights a need for improved conceptual representation of warming in models.Next, a series of microbial decomposition models were evaluated. A diminishing return mechanism (or reverse Michaelis-Menten function) leads to producing stable solutions in the transient stage. Also, laboratory measurements of essential microbial and enzymatic processes were coupled with simulation modeling, which was proposed to be an effective way to estimate wetland C fluxes under warming. This study highlights the importance of CUE and enzyme kinetics on thermal acclimation of soil organic matter decomposition, and identified the need for future investigations in order to improve our understanding of wetland C loss under warming.

T1  - Overwintering Strategies of <i>Ascaphus montanus,</i> the Rocky Mountain Tailed Frog
AN  - 1767441138
AB  - The Mountain Tailed Frog, Ascaphus montanus is a cryophile that is associated with permanent mountain streams in the Northwestern United States. Although unknown, adults likely overwinter in the fast moving streams, but to do so they would need to survive extended bouts of subzero temperatures. Previous work has described the frog’s ability to supercool to low temperatures and survive freezing. The purpose of this study was to determine tissue level indicators of freeze tolerance, namely cryoprotectant concentrations and wet mass. Winter acclimated frogs cooled from 2°C at 0.2°C h-1 and then held at -1°C until they spontaneously froze or had a small ice chip placed on their pack to inoculate freezing after 3 days. After being held at -1 °C for seven days, they were then removed, double pithed and the gracilis and gastrocnemius muscles, heart, and liver were removed on ice. Water content of the liver was determined after a portion of the tissue was blotted dry, weighed and dried in an oven at 60 C°. Water content significantly increased after freezing. Urea and Glycerol concentration were below detectable limits of the assay. Glucose concentrations did not change in response to freezing but were elevated compared to acclimatized individuals of other species. Based on the known literature and previous work it seems that this species can survive in high sub-zero temperatures found in its aquatic environment. These data suggest that the frogs may survive freezing in conditions likely found in their stream habitat and may use a combination of supercooling and freeze tolerance to overwinter.

T1  - Exploring ecological risks facing regional sagebrush ecosystems in the 21<sup>st</sup> century
AN  - 1762747578
AB  - Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) ecosystems have experienced loss over large portions of their historic range throughout the intermountain western United States over the last two centuries. Leading into the 21st century, much of this loss could be attributed to anthropogenic land conversion -- particularly from regional population growth, agricultural development, and the spread of invasive species. Over the course of the 21st century, climate change and invasive grassland conversion (Bromus tectorum) are expected to further alter the structure of regional sagebrush ecosystems, potentially contributing to range loss for big sagebrush and its many obligate species. My overall objective was to investigate the exposure of sagebrush ecosystems to risks from climate change and invasive species spread. I developed a series of species distribution models (SDMs) for three major sagebrush subspecies and compare the trajectory of regional sagebrush ecosystems under future climate conditions.  I assessed my confidence in range projections for big sagebrush under future climate conditions using a sensitivity analysis to explore deficiencies in the underlying data behind my SDMs. Lastly, I attempted to assess the invasibility of climatically-stable sagebrush ecosystems by developing and deploying a process-based demographic model for cheatgrass at sites throughout the intermountain region.   I implemented a series of big sagebrush species distribution models (SDMs) fit to individual subspecies records of big sagebrush.  I used climate variables previously described as limiting for big sagebrush as explanatory data and extrapolate the models into mid-century and end-of-century conditions using an ensemble of recent global circulation model (GCM) data.  I expected all three big sagebrush subspecies to respond negatively to increases in temperature and drier summer conditions forecasted for much of the intermountain region, assuming that future environmental conditions would warm beyond the environmental tolerances to which big sagebrush is physiologically adapted to.   However, at the subspecies level, this did not appear to be the case. Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) and basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata) both demonstrated slight range expansion, largely along elevational gradients, under end-of-century forecasts across GCMs. Although experiencing loss within southern portions of their current range, the warmer winter conditions and slightly drier summer conditions forecasted for wyomingensis and tridentata are not so unusual that the subspecies don’t currently encounter these conditions within portions of their current range.  Notably, mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana) does respond negatively to future climate conditions, with winter temperatures increasing beyond what the subspecies experiences across its current range.  Unlike ssp. tridentata and wyomingensis, vaseyana does not appear to have a large elevational gradient to retreat into under future climate conditions, which could result in potentially large losses of its current range if the subspecies is unable to adapt and compete under warmer conditions. In order to better indicate confidence in SDM predictions for big sagebrush, I used a Monte Carlo-based sensitivity analysis to demonstrate how uncertainties attributed to occurrence, absence, and climate data biases propagate through two commonly used SDM algorithms (Generalized Linear Models [GLMs] and Random Forests [RF]) for sagebrush ecosystems dominated by ssp. wyomingensis and tridentata. I derived predictive intervals for both GLM and RF and used the intervals to produce envelopes indicating areas of high and low predictive confidence in SDM predictions and explore how bias can contribute to latitudinal and elevational drift in suitability predictions. Both algorithms demonstrated sensitivities to climate and presence-record uncertainty that translated to large geographic uncertainty in predictions.  I found that RF is more sensitive to bias than GLM, and that climate and presence record bias contributed to greater predictive ambiguity than absence record uncertainty. I found that uncertainties in predictions arising from data uncertainty could easily produce the same magnitude of range shift as those observed under mid-century (2050) predictions of distributional change for big sagebrush under climate change, suggesting that mid-century forecasts of change for big sagebrush are not so unusual that they couldn’t also be explained by biases affecting underlying data. However, many late-century (2100) predictions of suitability change appear to diverge from what was observed in our sensitivity analysis and deserve greater confidence. As roughly half of climatically suitable space available to big sagebrush throughout the intermountain region has experienced some degree of invasion by cheatgrass, it’s continued spread is an important factor to consider in assessing the long-term viability of big sagebrush ecosystems. Using a soil hydrology model (SOILWAT) and a meta-analysis conducted from a number of studies of cheatgrass’ demography and physiology, I built a process-based model that simulates cheatgrass population growth over time.  I applied the model to current climate conditions at a number of sites sampled from sagebrush ecosystem subspecies strata across the intermountain region and found detectable differences in population suitability response.  The cheatgrass demographic model demonstrates detectable differences in population response between montane sites (suitable for ssp. vaseyana) and basin sites (suitable for ssp. wyomingensis and tridentata) that suggest basin subspecies ranges are more suitable for cheatgrass than montane sites. I also demonstrate that basin subspecies are typically closer to known invasive annual grasslands throughout the intermountain region, and are probably more susceptible to cheatgrass propagule pressure. A synthesis of results across my studies suggests differing fates for regional sagebrush ecosystems. Although ssp. wyomingensis and tridentata dominated sagebrush ecosystems may be potentially robust to future climate change, they demonstrate a greater risk to cheatgrass invasion, which could challenge the long-term stability of sagebrush ecosystems in the basin interior of the intermountain region.  Conversely, although montane sagebrush ecosystems dominated by ssp. vaseyana may be at comparatively less risk of cheatgrass invasion, these sagebrush ecosystems will face greater exposure to climate change stressors over the course of the 21st century.

T1  - Short term adult plasticity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster </i> and its role in climatic adaptation
AN  - 1759630576
AB  - Adaptation to environmental heterogeneity is a fundamental aspect in evolutionary biology. A constantly changing environment puts continuous stress on organisms, and causes spatially and temporally varying selection regimes where survival depends on responsiveness. Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism enabling this responsiveness, which manifests upon exposure to an environmental stressor and facilitates a more resistant phenotype. Environmental heterogeneity exposure at the adult life stage of an organism produces a plastic response that is important for local adaptation and persistence. Hence, adaptive plasticity is an important mechanism of adaptation to localized environmental variation.  To study short term exposure plasticity, we sampled Northern and Southern populations of Drosophila melanogaster, originating from distinct geographic regions and habitats in eastern North America. To elicit a plastic response these populations were exposed to two environmental variables, temperature and photoperiod, for a short-term (five-day) treatment. Flies that had been exposed to this treatment were then tested for phenotypic stress response using chill coma tolerance, heat shock and starvation resistance assays, all of which act as proxies for fitness. To test their response to the natural environment, the same populations were exposed to outdoor field conditions for a treatment equivalent to that in the lab, after which their stress response to heat and cold tolerance was recorded. Whole genome level plasticity was observed by sequencing the transcriptome of lab flies exposed to the same treatment of crossed temperature and photoperiod regimes as the phenotyped flies; thus, allowing for a complimentary gene expression plasticity study. Geographic origin and temperature treatment determined the phenotypic stress response for the three stress assays. Photoperiod showed significant interaction with temperature, indicating that D. melanogaster is responding to both cues in order to modify its life-history strategies. The field results showed the Northern population had a faster chill coma recovery time when exposed to extreme cold temperatures relative to the Southern population, where this was not observed, suggesting adaptive cold response plasticity is important in the Northern population’s fitness. Lastly, the Northern and Southern populations showed a differential expression plasticity response, which is consistent with the expected patterns based on spatially varying selection.

T1  - Physiological adaptations of Diamond killifish (<i>Adinia xenica</i>) to survive temperature extremes
AN  - 1758252393
AB  - Diamond killifish, Adinia xenica, is a species of shallow saltmarsh fish subject to rapid temperature increases over short periods of time as well as high and low temperature extremes, however little is known about this organism’s thermal ecology. Chronic thermal maxima and minima were measured in addition to critical thermal maxima and minima (CTmaxima/minima) at four acclimation temperatures in order to construct a thermal polygon and quantify the thermal niche of diamond killifish. Fish acclimated to temperatures of 10.6, 16.7, 26.1, and 35.2°C demonstrated CTmaxima of 38.6, 38.7, 42.0, and 43.8°C, and CTminima of 0.7, 1.7, 4.6, and 9.4°C respectively, and the resulting thermal polygon had an area of 1320.7°C2. Fish acclimated to 10.6, 16.8, and 26.0°C were plunged to increased temperatures of 16.8, 26.0, and 35.6°C respectively, and acclimation rates were measured by recording CTmaxima values after 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days. The CTmaxima of reciprocal transfers were also recorded, and resultant data were used to construct second-order polynomial regressions to model acclimation from low to high and high to low temperature changes. This fish demonstrates acclimation patterns much like Cyprinodon dearborni, with most tolerance gained or lost within five days post-transfer.

T1  - Nesting ecology and interactions between local and international priorities for hawksbill sea turtle (<i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i>) conservation on the Pacific Coast of Central America
AN  - 1739191626
AB  - Despite human interaction with the biophysical environment since the beginning of human history, traditional research generally studied human and natural systems separately when addressing human-nature interactions. The purpose of my research is to better understand the nesting ecology and interactions between local and international priorities for hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) conservation in El Salvador and Nicaragua, where >90% of eastern Pacific hawksbill nesting occurs. In the first study, I explained the realities experienced by coastal residents who share habitat with hawksbills in El Salvador and then identified and clarified implications of discrepancies between these realities and international priorities for hawksbill conservation. The main findings were 1) primary importance of hawksbills is economic value attached to egg sales, but deeper cultural connections exist, 2) egg purchase by hatcheries benefits hawksbills and humans and 3) opportunities for local residents to participate in decision-making  are limited and should be increased.  In the second study, I characterized the microhabitat preferences and repeatability of nest-site choice by hawksbills, and then clarified the implications of doomed egg relocation programs on gene pools of hawksbills. I found 1) hawksbills preferred nest sites with abundant vegetation on dynamic beaches in mangrove estuaries, 2) female hawksbills exhibited local adaptations to differences in nesting habitat and 3) individual hawksbills consistently placed nests under high percentages of overstory vegetation, but were inconsistent in nest placement related to woody vegetation borders.   In the third study, I generated and analyzed thermal profiles of hawksbill nest environments and estimated the sex ratios and physical condition of hatchling hawksbills under natural and artificial conditions. The primary findings were 1) minimal differences in temperature existed between sand depths, 2) adjustment of nest depth is unlikely to compensate for climate change, 3) in situ clutches incubated at higher temperatures and produced less fit offspring and 4) egg relocation can contribute to recovery efforts.  The findings of these studies offer insight into interactions between hawksbill population dynamics and local community development on the Pacific coast of Central America, and demonstrate the value of implementing an evidence-based approach to guide public policy and conservation strategies.

T1  - Affects of acclimation temperature on the critical thermal maxima and minima of the little skate, <i>Leucoraja erinacea</i>
AN  - 1738998680
AB  - Little skates, Leucoraja erinacea, inhabit cold-water habitats where temperatures approach the freezing point of seawater, yet little is known about this species’ thermal ecology. I quantified critical thermal maxima (CTMaxima) and minima (CTMinima) and determined the thermal niche of little skates from Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Fish acclimated at 5.3, 10.5, 15.0, or 15.8°C exhibited respective CTMaxima of 24.4, 28.1, 28.0, or 27.0°C, and CTMinima of -3.1, -1.9, 0.6, or -0.4°C. A thermal tolerance polygon from laboratory data revealed an area of 522°C 2—the second smallest measured in a batoid—and a limited acclimation range of 18°C. The thermal niche is dominated by intrinsic tolerance, and a low acclimation response ratio (~0.3°C per 1°C change in acclimation temperature), limiting little skate acclimation adjustments to no more than 5.5°C. My data suggest that little skates are an obligate cold-water species that may not fare well under warming sea temperatures.

T1  - Coastal ocean pH variability in the context of global change biology
AN  - 1735794630
AB  - Anthropogenic carbon emissions are predicted to alter marine ecosystems. One such change is the decline in ocean pH, known as ocean acidification. Model predictions of ocean acidification have guided biological experiments for more than a decade. Many studies predict negative consequences of future ocean pH on marine species. To understand how species will respond to future conditions, however, knowledge of present-day pH exposures is necessary and often limited. In this dissertation, I described present-day pH variability in three coastal regions and used the data to design laboratory experiments assessing the physiological response of two organisms, sea urchins and mussels, to changing ocean conditions. As recorded by autonomous pH sensors, I found three unique patterns of coastal pH variability. Near-shore Antarctica was characterized by a steep seasonal increase in pH and pH variability during summer phytoplankton blooms. The northern Channel Islands, California, exhibited event-scale and diurnal pH variability due to primary production of phytoplankton and fixed vegetation. Only mild effects from upwelling were detected at the islands, suggesting that this region may become a spatial refuge from extreme low pH in the future. Finally, Oregon was characterized by event-scale decreases in pH due to periodic upwelling events. The results from this research show that many coastal species experience short-term changes in pH that are within the same magnitude of change predicted for ocean acidification by the end of the century. While such present-day exposures to pH variability may promote tolerance of future pH change, these near-shore regions are also characterized by unique patterns of thermal stress. I conducted two studies to investigate the interactive effects of pH and temperature on organismal physiology. First, Antarctic sea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri, early developmental stages (EDSs) currently experience < 2 °C seasonal warming and may only experience a few degrees of ocean warming over the next 100 years. Despite development under pH and temperatures outside of current exposures,  S. neumayeri EDSs exhibited high tolerance of a one-hour heat stress test, suggesting this species may be more resilient to ocean change than previously thought. Second, unlike Antarctic species, intertidal species at mid-latitudes experience daily temperature fluctuations that can exceed four times end-century predictions of ocean warming, due to tidal cycles. In Oregon, upwelling events enhance this temperature range by periodically delivering cold, low pH water to the intertidal zone. Depending on sea water conditions simulating an upwelling event (cold, low pH) or wind relaxation (warm, high pH), the intertidal mussel  Mytilus californianus generated different transcriptomic signatures of the cellular heat shock response, following exposure to aerial heat stress. This suggests that future changes in seawater conditions may alter the heat stress tolerance of M. californianus during low tides. The results from this dissertation highlight the importance of designing experiments that reflect species’ present-day and future multi-stressor environment, in order to generate ecologically relevant conclusions. As anthropogenic stressors continue to take hold of coastal seas, understanding the biological consequences is critical for management and conservation efforts.

T1  - Ecological genomics of an intertidal marine snail: Population structure and local adaptation to heat stress in <i>Chlorostoma</i> (formerly <i>Tegula) funebralis</i>
AN  - 1732683678
AB  - The intertidal marine snail Chlorostoma (formerly  Tegula) funebralis has a wide geographic distribution, and across this range populations are exposed to large variations in temperature. Southern California (USA) populations generally occupy warmer climates and are presumably exposed to high air temperatures during low tides more often than northern California populations. C. funebralis’ broad, thermally heterogeneous geographic range could promote local adaptation, or the fine-tuning of individuals to their local habitat via natural selection. However, this species also has pelagic larvae, and available genetic data have found no evidence for population structure, suggesting there may be extensive gene flow that could preclude local adaptation. Overall, the potential for adaptive differentiation in C. funebralis is unclear because the balance between selection for local adaptation and the rate of interpopulation gene flow is largely unknown. To address this issue phenotypic assays were used to identify initial evidence for local adaptation to heat stress in three northern and three southern California C. funebralis populations, and subsequently mRNA and DNA were sampled from these populations to examine transcriptome and genome-wide signatures of local adaptation. In the field, temperature data loggers were also deployed to explicitly quantify regional differences in thermal stress exposure among populations. The cumulative results of this work uncovered: (i) phenotypic evidence for local adaptation to heat stress between northern and southern California populations, with southern populations being more thermally tolerant than northern ones, (ii) region-specific transcriptomic responses to heat stress in northern and southern California, including unique gene expression strategies in southern populations that potentially confer higher thermal tolerance, (iii) differences in the frequency and magnitude of extreme thermal stress events in northern and southern California, and (iv) genomic evidence for ecological adaptation against a background of homogeneity in northern and southern California populations. Not only do these findings provide unique insights into region-specific responses of thermal stress response, but they also suggest that adaptation to local environmental differences can evolve despite a pelagic larval phase in C. funebralis. Accounting for intraspecific population variation in thermal tolerance may provide important insights for predicting how species distributions will respond to global warming.

T1  - Effects of the developmental environment on oxidative damage and antioxidants in red-eared slider turtle (<i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i>) hatchlings
AN  - 1732672809
AB  - Developmental environments influence many individual phenotypes. However, currently we have a limited understanding of how the developmental environment influences oxidative stress resistance phenotypes. Oxidative stress is defined as a physiological state during which the production of harmful free radicals exceeds the protective capabilities of antioxidants. Variations among adults in susceptibility to oxidative stress can have important consequences for life history strategies and fitness related traits. Our work was aimed at providing insight in to the role that the developmental environment plays on oxidative stress phenotypes in the model oviparous reptile the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans). Here, we conducted three independent experiments to determine if hatchling levels of oxidative damage and antioxidant activities vary following manipulations of the incubation thermal environment. First, to investigate if temperature fluctuations elicit oxidative stress during incubation, eggs from clutches were randomly assigned to a constant temperature (29.5°C) or daily sinusoidal fluctuating temperature incubation (28.7+3°C) treatment. Second, to assess the effect of temperature fluctuation frequency on oxidative stress, eggs were incubated in one of three fluctuating incubation regimes; 28.7+3°C sinusoidal fluctuations every 12 (Hyper), 24 (Normal), or 48 hours (Hypo). Third, we tested the influence of average incubation temperature on hatchling oxidative damage and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). To test this, eggs were incubated in daily sinusoidally fluctuating incubation temperature regime with a mean temperature of 26.5 ° C (Low), 27.1 °C (Medium), or 27.7 °C (High). We report that regardless of any thermal manipulation, no treatment effects on hatchling accumulation of oxidative damage were observed. This finding suggests that  T. scripta hatchlings have sufficient antioxidant defenses that effectively protect individuals from temperature induced oxidative stress during incubation. However, hatchling TAC was influenced by both temperature fluctuation frequency and average incubation temperature. Following incubation with a low frequency of temperature fluctuations individuals had a reduced TAC, while incubation at a lower average temperature was associated with enhanced TAC. These results indicate that hatchling TAC is likely sensitive to the developmental thermal environment and may have important future consequences for hatchling fitness. In addition to temperature, we also saw that both oxidative damage and TAC were significantly related to clutch identity suggesting that there are either strong maternal or genetic factors influencing early life oxidative status of T. scripta.

T1  - Environmental impacts and carry-over effects in complex life cycles: The role of different life history stages
AN  - 1729439394
AB  - A challenge faced by organisms with complex life cycles is how environmental factors experienced at an earlier life stage affect the fitness at that stage or are carried over to subsequent life stages. I used container-inhabiting mosquitoes: Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti, Aedes triseriatus and Culex quinquefasciatus to study the interactions and performance of life history stages under specific environmental factors. I investigated the effects of egg-desiccation tolerance on egg viability and larval performance in the Aedes mosquitoes. I found increase in egg hatch rate with relative humidity and interaction between relative humidity and egg storage period. Larval performance differed among species, but egg-desiccation tolerance did not lead to higher larval performance. I examined the effects of temperature on the outcome of larval intraspecific competition as well as interactions between temperatures for rearing and those for adult maintenance in Aedes albopictus. I found that increasing temperatures resulted in shorter development time and smaller adult sizes while increasing densities led to longer development time and smaller adult sizes for males and females. There was also an interaction between larval and adult temperatures; higher temperatures led to greater differences in female fecundity, and lower temperatures led to increased survival. I investigated the effects of female natal habitat on oviposition responses and larval performance in Ae. albopictus, Ae aegypti and Cx quinquefasciatus. I found that Ae aegypti showed no oviposition preference,  Ae. albopictus significantly preferred animal:leaf detritus infusion and Cx quinquefasciatus did not oviposit in tap water. However, there was no overall carry-over effects of natal habitat on oviposition choices and population growth. I examined the relationships among female natal habitat, female size, egg number, and egg volume in Ae. albopictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus. For Ae. albopictus, I found strong positive relationships in animal detritus with female size and egg number, and in leaf detritus with egg volume. For Cx. quinquefasciatus, I found strong positive relationships in animal detritus with female size and egg number. My study provides more insight on the importance of habitat heterogeneity and environmental stochasticity, and the strength of their carry-over effects across life stages in complex life cycles.

T1  - Ecology and Evolution of Geographic Range Size Variation in North American Plethodontid Salamanders: Perspectives from Thermal Physiology
AN  - 1725140503
AB  - Species exhibit remarkable variation in geographic range size. Understanding the causes of this variation is fundamental to the fields of ecology and evolution, and is central to understanding how species will respond to rapid climate change. Using eastern North America’s species-rich salamander fauna, I explore whether seasonal variation in temperature and climatic tolerance evolution underlie geographic range size variation (as per the climate variability hypothesis). First, I determined critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and critical thermal minimum (CTMin) temperatures of 18 salamander species. I then tested for relationships between thermal tolerances, seasonality, and geographic range size. Localities with greater annual temperature ranges (seasonality) were found to have individuals with broader thermal tolerances, and correspondingly species with larger latitudinal extents. Intraspecific tests, however, found only one of six wide-ranging species to relate thermal tolerances to environmental temperature changes across the range. Next, I estimated acclimation ability of salamanders to see if species with larger distributions have greater physiological plasticity. Salamanders were acclimated to 14 and 22°C and results of a phylogenetically controlled MCMCglmm model indicated that there are significant differences in temperature adjusted standard metabolic rates (SMRs) of species with wide versus narrow latitudinal extents. Wide-ranging species showed a slight increase in SMR after acclimation, whereas narrow-ranging species showed a statistically significant drop in SMR. These results indicate that wide-ranging species have a greater thermal acclimation capacity than narrow-ranging species. Finally, using GIS-based climate data I included all available locality points to estimate species-level thermal niche breadths. I found that CTMax and CTMin of species are strongly correlated with the maximum and minimum temperatures that occur within their geographic ranges. I also found that species’ thermal tolerance breadths (CTMax – CTMin) are highly correlated with estimates of their thermal niche breadths. My general finding that wide-ranging species have broader physiological tolerances than narrow-ranging species supports key predictions of the climate variability hypothesis and the role of seasonality in the evolution of physiological traits. It also highlights the potential vulnerability of narrow-ranging montane salamanders.

T1  - Climate anomalies and primary production in Lake Superior
AN  - 1712659898
AB  - This dissertation supports the modeling of primary production in Lake Superior by offering site specific kinetics and algorithms developed from lab experiments performed on the natural phytoplankton assemblage of Lake Superior. Functions, developed for temperature, light and nutrient conditions and the maximum specific rate of primary production, were incorporated in a 1D specific primary production model and confirmed to published  in-situ measured rates of primary production.    An extensive data set (supporting model calibration and confirmation), with a fine spatiotemporal resolution, was developed from field measurements taken bi-weekly during the sampling seasons of 2011, 2012 and 2014; considered to be meteorologically average, extremely warm and cold years, respectively. Samplings were taken at 11 stations along a 26 km transect extending lakeward from Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula covering the nearshore to offshore gradient. Measurements included: temperature, solar radiation, transparency, beam attenuation, chlorophyll-a fluorescence, colored dissolved organic matter, suspended solids and phosphorus and carbon constituents. Based on these measurements and application of the developed primary production model, patterns in primary production and driving forces (i.e. temperature, light and nutrients) are described in a seasonal, spatial, and interannual fashion.    The signal feature in 2011 was the development of a mid-summer “desert” in the offshore surface waters (a period of suboptimal temperatures coincident with a high degree of phosphorus limitation). The manifestation of the “summer desert”, however, was most extreme during the warm year and nonexistent during the cold year. Offshore primary production in all years manifested a subsurface maximum in the upper area of the metalimnion, distinctly above the deep chlorophyll maximum, with rates of production xiv being highest in 2011 (∼20 mg C m-3 d-1) followed by 2012 (∼17 mg Cm-3 d-1) and lowest in 2014 (∼12 mg Cm-3 d-1). Driven by variances in biomass and forcing conditions, offshore areal primary production manifested differences in seasonal patterns between years as well. In 2011 and 2014 a negatively skewed bell-shape pattern was observed, differing in magnitude and timing. The pattern in 2012 differed from these years in magnitude and timing, manifesting elevated production in April and decreased production in September. Greatest areal production in 2012 occurred in July and August (∼320 mg Cm -2 d-1), in 2014 in August (∼265 mg Cm-2  d-1) and in 2011 production was greatest in July (253 mg C m-2 d-1). Areal production in the summer of 1998, calculated for EPA’s 19 offshore stations in Lake Superior, manifested comparable rates and averaged 224 ± 90 mg C m-2·d -1.    Although in all years the development of the thermal bar (TB) occurred after the spring runoff event, an increase in chlorophyll-a concentration during the presence of the TB was observed in 2012. Rates of primary production during this period, however, decreased while the opposite occurred in 2014, signifying that changes in chlorophyll-a concentration should be interpreted carefully (especially if used to identify spring blooms).    The information presented in this work not only offers site specific kinetics, appropriate algorithms in support of primary production modeling and an extensive dataset supporting model calibration and confirmation, it also offers new insights into the dynamics of the Lake Superior ecosystem and the forces driving its function.

T1  - Tests for Positive Selection on Genes Encoding Heat Shock Proteins in the Marine Slipper Snail, <i>Crepidula fornicata</i>
AN  - 1706877011
AB  - Sedentary organisms that inhabit the marine intertidal zone must be adapted to withstand  forms of environmental stress that are uncommon in other marine environments. Adaptations  to these stressors are apparent in the morphologies, behaviors, life histories, and regulation  and products of genes of sedentary intertidal organisms (Lent 1969; Garrity 1984; Schmidt et  al 2008). However, for those species that have a planktonic larval stage, evolutionary  specialization at the molecular level could be constrained by opposing requirements for larvae and adults that are adapted to very different environments. This constraint would have  been removed in lineages that lost the ancestral larval stage, and reinstated in lineages that  secondarily reacquired a larval stage. A comparative approach using a group in which the  planktonic larval stage has been lost and reacquired could be used to test the hypothesis that  adaptive evolution of stress-related genes accompanies these life-history transitions.     Genes with known roles in physiological stress tolerance include those that encode  the family of 70 kilodalton heat shock proteins (hsp70s ) (Feder and Hofmann 1999).  Statistical tests for departures from selective neutrality were applied to sequence variation in  hsp70  genes of calyptraeid gastropods. The Calpytraeidae include both intertidal and subtidal  species, as well as species that have lost or secondarily reacquired the ancestral planktonic  larval stage (Collin 2003a; Collin et al. 2007). I focused on two species: Crepidula fornicata  and C. atrasolea. Both species are found in low intertidal and subtidal habitats in the western tlantic region. However, whereas the eggs of C. fornicata hatch into planktonic veligers,  the eggs of C. atrasolea develop directly into crawling juveniles. I tested for selection with  statistics that characterize the distribution of sequence variation within and between species,  comparing values for each  hsp70 gene fragment with expectations for selectively neutral loci.

T1  - Impact of Development on Freshwater Turtle Populations of Coastal South Carolina: An Examination of Land Use and Road Density
AN  - 1703434024
AB  - Previous studies (Haxon 2000; Steen and Gibbs 2004; Marchand and Litvaitis 2004; Aresco 2005) have demonstrated that urbanization and development have disproportionally adverse affects on female turtles. In order to test this paradigm I caught 301 turtles (primarily Trachemys scripta scripta ) in ten ponds (5 impacted and 5 unimpacted) across coastal South Carolina. Not only do coastal South Carolina turtles not follow the same male biased pattern of many other studies, there was an overall female bias (154:95). Turtle metrics were between the types of sites existed as well, indicating larger/older population of turtles in unimpacted sites. Water quality parameters  (dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature) were examined. The unimpacted sites exhibited more conductive parameters for the majority of biota. Diversity was significantly larger in unimpacted sites as well. It appears that the turtle populations (largely Trachemys scripta) examined have a high tolerance for human impact (both with regards to water quality and direct mortality) based on their high abundance in impacted areas. They may be exception to the male biased population paradigm exhibited by the majority of other turtles in previous studies.

T1  - Novel pathways of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
AN  - 1697861424
AB  - Introduction:  Diastolic heart failure (HF) i.e., HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for ~50% of all clinical HF presentations; but unlike systolic HF i.e., HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), there are no evidenced based therapies. Obesity is commonly associated with HFpEF. However, there exist a sub-group of obese patients that exhibit a higher survival rate to HFpEF as compared to average patients. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for HFpEF, with a prevalence of 60-89% reported by large controlled trials, epidemiological studies and HF registries. HFpEF morbidity and mortality rates are staggering: 50-60% 5 year mortality rate, 50% 6 month rehospitalization rate and severe clinical disability.  However, there remains an incomplete mechanistic understanding about HFpEF.      Objectives:  We wanted to explore new pathways related to HFpEF in order to better understand the mechamisms behind its pathophysiology. To do so, we first wanted to explore the potential crosstalk between the heart and adipose tissue during HFpEF by analyzing the adipose tissue in our HFpEF model. Secondly, we sought to test the hypothesis that chronic ETA/ETB inhibition with macitentan (mac) modulates pathologic cardiac remodeling in hypertension-induced HFpEF.      Methods:  Mice (20-25 g) were anesthetized, underwent uninephrectomy and received either a continuous infusion of saline (sham) or d-aldosterone (0.3 ug/hour for 4-weeks via osmotic minipumps). All mice were maintained on standard rodent chow and 1.0% sodium chloride drinking water for 4 weeks and then harvested.   Second group of mice underwent the same surgical procedure and infusion. They were maintained on standard chow for 2 weeks and then each group was randomized to chow containing macitentan (30 mg/kg/day, HFpEF mac) or standard rodent chow. After 2 additional weeks, the 4 groups of mice (n=4-8/group) were harvested.     Blood pressure (BP) was obtained weekly. Prior to sacrifice, body weight and echocardiography parameters (total wall thickness (TWT) and relative wall thickness (RWT)) were determined. We also obtained diastolic dysfunction parameters including deceleration time (DT), isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), and E/A ratio. Furthermore, we measured organ weight after harvesting the mice and obtained histological images for the adipose tissues collected. Glucose tolerance test and acute cold tolerance test were performed on HFpEF mice to determine their metabolic state.      Results:  HFpEF mice developed hypertension, LV hypertrophy, and diastolic dysfunction. Epididymal and inguinal adipose tissue showed significantly reduced weight and adipocyte size. HFpEF mice displayed regular glucose metabolism but were not able to endure a cold tolerance test as their body temperature dropped too low.      After 4 weeks, there was no difference in body weight between sham, HFpEF, shammac and HFpEFmac. As expected HFpEF increased systolic BP (117±14 vs 133±16mmHg; P=NS); macitentan did not lower systolic BP after 2 weeks in either shammac or HFpEFmac. Similarly there was no difference in systolic BP between HFpEF and HFpEF mac. Both kidney and spleen weights were increased in HFpEF but not altered by macitentan therapy. There was no change in lung congestion as measured by wet-dry lung ratio.      HFpEF increased TWT (0.998±0.04 vs. 0.79±0.11 mm; P<0.01 vs. sham) and RWT (0.686± 0.10 vs. 0.476±0.05 mm; P<0.001 vs. sham) but were modulated by macitentan (HFpEF vs. HFpEFmac; P<0.05 and P<0.001, respectively). There was no difference in chamber size between HFpEF and HFpEFmac. Similarly, IVRT, DT, left ventricular ejection fraction were no different between HFpEF and and HFpEFmac. Furthermore E/A ratio was increased in HFpEF but was not affected by macitentan    Conclusions.  Adipose tissue collected from our HFpEF mice displayed a very different phenotype. This demonstrates that inter-tissue communication is definitely occurring between the adipose tissue and the heart. Further research is required to explore what that communication encompasses and how they can be used to improve HFpEF.     Macitentan did not lower systolic BP in sham or mice with HFpEF after the development of hypertension. Diastolic dysfunction, as measured by an increased E/A ratio, was not affected by macitentan. Macitentan significantly modulated TWT and RWT after 2 weeks of therapy. It is thus plausible that macitentan may improve HFpEF by improving adverse cardiac remodeling.

T1  - Cold tolerance of <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> (Diptera: Drosophilidae)
AN  - 1696068716
AB  - Drosophila suzukii Matsumura, or spotted wing drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae), is a fly that is believed to be native to Japan. Spotted wing drosophila females lay eggs into ripe and ripening soft skinned fruits, where larvae develop. The species was first found in the continental United States in 2008, where it was reported to cause extensive economic damage in many fruit crops, including raspberry, blackberry, blueberry and cherry.      Spotted wing drosophila is believed to overwinter as a seasonally acclimated winter morph adult. While spotted wing drosophila is found in northern states with colder climates, the ability of it to establish and overwinter in these regions is unknown. Likelihood of spotted wing drosophila overwintering survival was hypothesized by reviewing literature on other Drosophila species cold tolerance. Cold tolerance of spotted wing drosophila was then measured by comparing the supercooling points and lower lethal temperatures of seasonally acclimated (winter-morphs) and non-acclimated adults (summer-morphs). The ability of winter-morphs and summer-morphs to rapidly cold-harden was also studied to determine if the fly can quickly acclimate to new cold temperatures.

T1  - Linking Effects of Climate Change Stressors Across Biological Levels In Delta Smelt
AN  - 1695061088
AB  - In the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) the delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus, is an endemic, endangered fish strongly tied to California conservation planning that has suffered rapid population declines in recent decades. In chapter one, I examine the roles of ontogeny and phenotypic plasticity in delta smelt's temperature and salinity tolerance. The complex life history of delta smelt combined with dynamic seasonal and spatial abiotic conditions in the SFE results in dissimilar environments among ontogenetic stages, which may yield stage-specific susceptibility to abiotic stressors. I quantified thermal and salinity limits in several ontogenetic stages and acclimation states of delta smelt, and paired these data with environmental data to evaluate sensitivity to climate change stressors. Thermal tolerance decreased among successive stages, with larval fish exhibiting the highest tolerance and post-spawning adults having the lowest. Delta smelt had limited capacity to increase tolerance through thermal acclimation, and comparisons to field temperature data revealed that juvenile tolerance limits are the closest to current environmental conditions, which may make this stage especially susceptible to future climate warming. In contrast, delta smelt tolerated salinities spanning the range of expected environmental conditions for each ontogenetic stage, but salinity did impact survival in juvenile and adult stages in exposures over acute timescales. These results underscore the importance of considering ontogeny and phenotypic plasticity in assessing climate change impacts, particularly for species adapted to spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments.     In chapter 2, I assess the physiological mechanisms driving thermal tolerance patterns in the context of understanding how ontogeny and acclimation affect the cellular stress response in organisms with moderate thermal windows. Differential thermal tolerance and acclimation capacity between eurytherms and more thermally sensitive species may be driven by differences in molecular responses, and the recent rapid expansion of high-throughput molecular technologies has enabled investigations directly in non-model species. I combined next generation sequencing and microarray platforms to investigate the roles of acclimation, ontogeny and acute thermal challenge in delta smelt gene transcription as a species representing thermally sensitive fishes of high conservation concern. I linked results to thermal tolerance to understand how transcriptional stress responses manifest to organismal level phenotypic differences, and compared results to eurythermal species to identify possible mechanisms of thermal limitation.    In the final chapter, I explore the hypothesis of sublethal costs of osmotic stress as a possible contributing factor of delta smelt's in situ limitation to the SFE low salinity zone (LSZ; 1-6ppt) despite their capacity to tolerate a wide range of salinities (0.4-34.0ppt). As anthropogenic global change alters multiple environmental conditions, it can be challenging to predict species' responses without knowledge of how each factor directly or indirectly influences organismal fitness. I combined molecular and organismal measures to quantify the physiological mechanisms and sublethal costs of coping with salinity stress and linked these to survival. Transcriptome-wide assessments revealed large-scale coordinated changes in gene transcription in response to both hypo- and hyper-osmotic stress. Many of the strongest transcriptional changes associated with cell signaling, ionic and osmotic balance maintanence and increased energetic costs were seen at 0.4, 12 and 18ppt, relative to 2ppt control and 6ppt treatments. Blood plasma osmolality was most strongly affected in fish increased to 34ppt, but fish demonstrated capacity to effectively osmoregulate blood ionic balance within 4 days of exposure. This extreme treatment was also the only condition in which significant mortality was observed, with the vast majority occurring between 24 and 96 hrs. Taken together, these data suggest that delta smelt rapidly adjust their physiology to cope with increased salinity stress, and in extreme conditions fish that are unable to do so succumb to death shortly thereafter.

T1  - Adaptation to climate and climate change in Rocky Mountain butterflies: Morphology, physiology, and behavior
AN  - 1689691159
AB  - Understanding the relative contributions of evolution, plasticity and behavior for local adaptation to climate, and for adaptive responses to recent climate change, is a major challenge for global change biologists. My dissertation explores these issues for Colias butterflies along an elevation gradient. Adults use thermoregulatory behaviors to achieve optimal body temperatures. Past studies show local adaptation in fixed morphological differences in ventral hind-wing melanin and thoracic setal length and a degree of developmental plasticity associated with melanin. My dissertation makes four major contributions. First, reciprocal-transplant and common-garden experiments documented differences in thermal sensitivity for flight initiation between high (C. meadii) and lower (C. eriphyle) elevation species. C. meadii initiated flight at lower body temperatures than C. eriphyle. This result was contrary to expectations that behavior will hinder evolution in fixed physiological differences along climatic gradients. Second, laboratory experiments showed that high-elevation adults had higher survival after heat-shock relative to lower-elevation. In contrast, there were no significant differences in upper thermal limits for eggs from different elevations suggesting the lack of movement did not lead to the evolution of fixed physiological differences in this life stage. Third, I used historic collections of a high-elevation C. meadii to quantify changes over the past 60 years. While mean temperatures during the adult flight have increased significantly, both hind-wing melanin and setal length have also increased. I suggest that this due in part to developmental plasticity; cooler pupal temperature was associated with increased melanin. I propose that this is non-adaptive because pupal temperatures are poor predictors of adult temperatures. Fourth, I quantified seasonal changes in wing melanin for two populations of C. eriphyle. Seasonal change in wing melanin was associated with increases in pupal temperature. In contrast to  C. meadii, pupal temperatures were a good predictor of adult flight season temperature for C. eriphyle. Collectively, my results suggest that behavior does not reduce the importance of physiology and morphology in local adaptation to climate, and that potential for adaptive plasticity in high-elevation ectotherms may be strongly limited by variability and unpredictability in seasonal climate.

T1  - A closer look: Seasonality patterns of skin peptides and microhabitat temperatures in surviving <i>Colostethus panamensis</i> after disease outbreak in Panama
AN  - 1682043930
AB  - Amphibians are declining worldwide and are currently regarded as one of the most threatened classes of vertebrate animals. Many of these declines are due to the disease chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the fungal pathogen,  Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (“Bd”), and has been linked with declines and extirpations of over 200 species worldwide. Some of the most compelling examples of mass amphibian declines come from Central America, and from Western Panama in particular. For example, in 2004 at Omar Torrijos National Park, Panama, within five months of first  Bd detection, there was an ~80% change in amphibian abundances and a ~50% loss in species richness. Relatively few follow up studies have been conducted on the amphibian communities of Central America after chytridiomycosis outbreaks, but the few studies that have been conducted have reported differential survival among host species.       While it is known that the disease dynamics of chytridiomycosis exhibit seasonal fluctuations in many parts of the world, seasonality of infection patterns have been relatively unexplored in Panama. These previous studies in other parts of the world have suggested that seasonal fluctuations in disease dynamics are the primarily caused by temperature effects on Bd (i.e., by limiting Bd growth or providing optimal temperature conditions for Bd proliferation). However, few studies have focused on seasonality changes on host immune responses. Some studies have supported the idea that a key host immune defense against Bd is the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are produced in granular glands and secreted on the skin. AMPS may have the ability to inhibit  Bd growth but little is known about how these defenses may shift with season, or if they can influence infection patterns. I conducted the first study to investigate how seasonal fluctuations in amphibian immune responses may alter Bd infection and development of chytridiomycosis in Panama.     I conducted seasonal (wet and dry) post-decline surveys (2013–2014) in search of Colostethus panamensis in Omar Torrijos National Park. I collected microhabitat temperatures across the two seasons. In persisting populations of C. panamensis, I sampled for the presence and intensity of the pathogen (Bd) and collected host immune defenses (AMPs) across the seasons. The AMPs were tested for the ability effectiveness against Bd.      Although Neotropical temperatures are relatively constant compared to temperate climates, including in Panama, I found that that there are daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations that may influence disease patterns across seasons. The microhabitat mean and maximum temperature during the dry seasons were higher compared to the wet seasons in both sites. The overall infection prevalence of C. panamensis was 30.8%, which varied from 13.6–36.8 % depending on the season. There was a higher prevalence and intensity infection during the wet seasons compared to the dry seasons in both years.      In previous chytridiomycosis studies, seasonal fluctuations in infection dynamics were assumed to be due to the thermal envelope for Bd growth. However, I found that there are also seasonal fluctuations in innate immune defenses of the amphibian hosts (i.e., in skin peptide secretions). The AMPs collected from C. panamensis during the dry seasons were more effective at inhibiting Bd growth than those collected during the wet seasons. In addition, I found that AMP effectiveness across seasons is a better predictor of Bd-infection than microhabitat temperatures.      These results suggest that seasonal differences in peptide effectiveness against Bd may be playing a significant role in post-epidemic disease dynamics. This project highlights the importance of studying the disease dynamics among different time points of the year, even in Neotropical climates, due to the fluctuations observed in infection prevalence, temperature, and host’ immune defenses.

T1  - Population genomic inference of ecology, conservation, evolution, and demographic history of Atlantic seahorses and pipefishes (Syngnathidae)
AN  - 1660199883
AB  - In the Atlantic Ocean powerful directional ocean currents can play a significant role in the formation and persistence of marine species. Syngnathidae fishes have a sparse fossil record, high morphological plasticity, and many of these species are difficult to observe in the wild, therefore they frequently lack life history information and the status of regional lineages and species designations are often obscure. In this dissertation I explore the ecology, evolution, and conservation of primarily Atlantic seahorses (Hippocampus) and pipefish (Syngnathus) in four core chapters, using differing genetic datasets ranging from mitochondrial DNA to genome-wide RAD sequences. Most Synganthids have the potential to disperse passively by rafting on floating vegetation, and are direct developers, which is thought to limit their active mobility, yet many species have widespread distributions. The majority of genetic research on Syngnathids fishes has focused on Indo-Pacific species, however the Atlantic Ocean is home to dozens of species of pipefishes from nine genera and roughly 1/5th of the world's seahorses species. In Chapter 1, I use six loci to infer the species tree for all Atlantic seahorses and infer the demographic history and evolution of the "Hippocampus erectus complex." The results of this study support the establishment of an ancestral population of the H. erectus complex in the Americas, followed by the Amazon River outflow splitting it into Caribbean/North American H. erectus and South American H. patagonicus at a time of increased sedimentation and outflow. Following this split, colonization occurred across the Atlantic via the Gulf Stream currents with subsequent trans-Atlantic isolation. Based on the results of Chapter 1, the species H. erectus exhibited a panmictic genetic structure from Latin America to temperate New York waters. However, inhabitants of the temperate region are considered by some ecologists to be tropical vagrants that only arrive during warm seasons from the southern provinces and perish as temperatures decline. Contrary to the findings of Chapter 1, in Chapter 2, I use thousands of RADseq loci and show strong support that temperate inhabitants are genetically diverged from southern populations and are composed of an isolated and persistent ancestral gene pool. The aim of Chapter 3 is to investigate how major current forces as well as climatic and geographic processes have shaped the evolutionary and demographic history of western Atlantic seahorses (Hippocampus) and pipefishes (Syngnathus). This Chapter takes a comparative approach across five codistributed species (two seahorses and three pipefishes). Genomic patterns of subpopulation divergence and post-divergence gene flow may be shared amongst fish species with similar life history traits, however ecological differences (i.e., macroclimatic tolerance and rafting propensity) may impact the rates of gene exchange and/or isolation times between subpopulations. The result of this study show how directional ocean currents and the life history trait of rafting propensity impacts population divergence and connectivity, and predicts gene flow directionality and magnitude in four out of five of the focal taxa. Lastly in Chapter 4, I use a molecular forensics approach to track the U.S. dried seahorse trade. Due to global exploitation, the genus Hippocampus are the only fish to have all species listed under the Convention of International trade of endangered species (CITES). Millions of individuals are traded each year for the use in traditional Chinese medicine as well as for souvenirs and crafts. Using "DNA barcoding," while mentoring high school and undergraduate students, we identified and compared specimens collected from two primary U.S. dried seahorse end-markets: 1) traditional Chinese medicine and, 2) Internet and coastal souvenir retailers. The results of this study found a significant contrast in both the species composition and size of individuals being sold between each market.

T1  - Potential climate and land use change effects on Brook Trout in the eastern United States
AN  - 1847568770
AB  - Brook Trout is a socially, economically and ecologically important species throughout its native range in the eastern United States (hereafter referred to as the eastern U.S.). Brook Trout have narrow habitat requirements and have already been extirpated or negatively affected throughout much of the eastern U.S. as a result of human activities and related environmental changes. These historic losses have led to an increasing interest in Brook Trout conservation and concerns over how future climate and land use changes might alter habitats and result in further losses. Increasing air temperatures resulting from climate change are expected to result in widespread losses of cold water (< ∼21°C mean July water temperature) habitat in rivers and streams. Since Brook Trout are physiologically dependent upon cold water, warming is very likely to result in reduced and extirpated populations throughout much of the eastern U.S. Historic and contemporary land use change has been one of the major historic drivers resulting in losses of Brook Trout populations through habitat alterations. Land use change, especially urban development, is continuing at a rapid pace in many parts of the eastern U.S. and will likely result in localized losses of Brook Trout populations where such changes occur in the future. Given the potential for climate and land use change to negatively affect Brook Trout populations, identifying potential effects for individual reaches can benefit conservation by identifying sensitive, vulnerable, and resilient river reaches. In this dissertation, I use publicly available data to identify the potential effects of projected climate and land use change on river water temperature and Brook Trout populations in individual stream reaches throughout the eastern U.S.   In Chapter 1, I quantitatively assessed the representativeness of stream flow and water temperature data from United States Geological Survey (USGS) gages throughout subregions of the conterminous United States, including the eastern U.S. This analysis was beneficial because prior to predicting attributes of almost 200,000 stream reaches in the eastern U.S., it was important to know how well available sampling data from a limited number of sites characterized the greater population of streams. I identified substantial biases for seven landscape attributes in one or more regions across the conterminous United States. Streams with small watersheds (< 10 km2</super>) and at high elevations were most often underrepresented, and biases were greater for water temperature gages and in arid regions throughout the conterminous United States. Similar landscape bias was evident in the eastern U.S., but I demonstrated how including water temperature data from additional sources resulted in a dataset that represented the population of stream reaches well. Although I did not use the same methods, I also determined the degree to which sampling data represented the larger population of stream reaches in Chapters 2 and 3.   River water temperature is one of the most important determinants of habitat quality for Brook Trout and is likely to be altered by climate and land use change. In Chapter 2, I developed a model to predict river water temperatures under current conditions and future scenarios of climate and land use change. The final model included air temperature, landform attributes and forested land cover and predicted mean daily water temperatures with good accuracy (root mean squared error ∼ 1.9 °C) for training and validation datasets. Predictions also matched expected spatial and temporal trends with cooler temperatures in headwaters, at higher elevations and latitudes, and in April and October. The model can be used to reasonably estimate thermal characteristics of stream reaches throughout the eastern U.S. to support ecosystem and resource management broadly. I demonstrate in Chapters 3 and 4 how predicted water temperatures from the model can be used to predict Brook Trout occurrence under current conditions and future scenarios of climate and land use change.    In Chapter 3, I develop a species distribution model to predict Brook Trout occurrence probability based on water temperature characteristics predicted by the model described in Chapter 2 and landscape characteristics. I used a hierarchical logistic regression model that performed well at both training and validation datasets (area under the receiver operating curve ∼ 0.78). Predicted water temperature had a strong negative effect on Brook Trout occurrence probability that did not vary throughout the region. The effects of agriculture and developed land covers were weakly negative, but an interaction suggested that agricultural land cover resulted in an increased sensitivity to water temperature. The effect of soil permeability was positive, but decreased as EDU mean soil permeability increased. The model provides a further understanding of how Brook Trout are shaped by habitat characteristics in the region and is the first to provide maps of stream reach-scale predictions, which can be used to support ongoing conservation and management efforts.   In Chapter 4, I used the models developed in Chapters 2 and 3 to identify potential changes in thermal habitat and Brook Trout occurrence probability resulting from projected climate and land use change. The timing, magnitude and location of predicted changes in maximum 30 day mean river water temperature varied greatly among three downscaled climate models, with average increases by 2087 ranging from 1.21 to 2.55 °C. As a result of warming, occurrence probability was predicted to be greatly reduced throughout the region, and between 56,440 (42.7%) and 109,237 (82.6%) of potential Brook Trout habitat was predicted to be lost. Land use change was predicted to result in localized increases in river water temperature and losses of 5,976 (4.5%) stream reaches with potential Brook Trout habitat. Given the magnitude of predicted losses, conservation actions will likely be more successful in the long term if the potential changes resulting from climate and land use change are incorporated into the planning process. My dissertation provides information to support this planning process by providing a suite of decision support tools that can be used to help understand potential changes for individual stream reaches, a scale at which many conservation activities are likely to be relevant.

T1  - Étude de la xylogénèse de l'épinette noire (<i>Picea mariana</i>) le long d'un gradient latitudinal
AN  - 1710455070
AB  - In cold climates, the expected global warming will lead to earlier cambial resumptions in spring, with a resultant lengthening of the growing season but unknown consequences on forest productivity. The phenological traits of cambium activity and xylem formation were analysed at a short time scale along a thermal gradient represented by an altilatitudinal range from the 48th to 53rd parallels and covering the whole closed blackspruce [Picea mariana  (Mill.) BSP] forest in Quebec, Canada. A hypothesis was tested that warmer temperatures influence cambium phenology, allowing longer duration and higher intensity of growth, and resulting in proportionally increased xylem production. From April to October 2012, cell division in cambium and post-cambial differentiation of xylem were observed on anatomical sections obtained from microcores collected weekly from the stem of fifty trees. The southern and warmer site was characterized by the highest radial growth, which corresponded to both the highest rates and longest durations of cell production. The differences in terms of xylem phenology and growth were marginal between the other sites. Xylem growth was positively correlated with rate and duration of cell production, with the latter explaining most variability in growth. Within the range analysed, the relationship between temperature and most phenological phases of xylogenesis was linear. On the contrary, temperature was related with cell production according to an exponential pattern. Periods of xylogenesis of 14 days longer (+13.1%) corresponded to a massive increase in cell production (33 cells, +109%). This disproportionate change occurred at a May-September average temperature of c.a. 14 °C and a snow-free period of 210-235 days. At the lower boundary of the distribution of black spruce, small environmental changes allowing marginal lengthening of the period of cell division could potentially lead to disproportionate increases in xylem cell production, with substantial consequences for the productivity of this boreal species. Models are a mathematic description of a phenomenon. They are useful to simplify and describe natural relationships and can be used to determine the link between the tree development and the surrounding environment. The aim of this research was to represent the relation between xylogenesis and it's alti-latitudinal location. The resulting equations were then extrapolated into a map covering the entire region studied by permanent plots.  Mcrocores were taken weekly from April to October 2012 for 50 black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP] distributed into five sites. Stations were located along a latitudinal gradient extending from the 48th to the 53rd parallel north and covering the entire distribution of the closed black spruce forest. Cellular analysis of each microcores has enabled to distinguish the dates of beginning and ending and then the duration in days for cell enlargement, cell wall thickening and xylogenesis and the total annual cells production. Latitude was the factor with the greatest impact while the altitude had minor or no effect, especially for nonlinear relations. Most results were linear such as the beginning of enlargement, beginning, ending and duration of lignification and the whole duration of xylogenesis. With the increasing latitude, dates were proportionally delayed for the beginning and earlier for the ending, thus creating a shorter duration. The temperature was suggested as the main factor driving these patterns. Duration and ending of enlargement and the complete cells production were nonlinear, with a regression similar to a negative exponential curve. This type of relationship seemed to indicate the presence of a limiting factor around the 49th parallel. This pattern was more complex and probably resulting from a combination of different factors.

T1  - Introgression, natural selection, and thermal tolerance in blue mussels (<i>Genus mytilus</i>)
AN  - 1655594723
AB  - My dissertation addressed questions of the origin and maintenance of biodiversity, and the genomic response to environmental change in blue mussels (genus Mytilus). In chapters One and Two I explored the nature of species barriers and the consequence of hybridization. The ecological and genetic factors determining the extent of introgression between species in secondary contact zones remain poorly understood. I investigated the relative importance of natural selection and the demographic expansion of invasive  Mytilus galloprovincialis on the magnitude and the direction of introgression with the native M. trossulus in a hybrid zone in central California. I used double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) to genotype 1,751 randomly-selected single nucleotide polymorphisms and accurately distinguish early and advanced generation hybrids for the first time in Mytilus. I found that ecologically based selection plays only a small direct role in maintaining reproductive isolation in the California hybrid zone, and that colonization history is an important control on the movement of genetic elements (i.e. introgression) during hybridization. Despite only low rates of hybridization between invasive Mediterranean blue mussel (M. galloprovincialis) and native blue mussel  M. trossulus, introgression is occurring, and the geographic spread of M. galloprovincialis appears to drive the majority of introgression into the invasive species. My work reinforces the idea that demographic processes mediate the role played by natural selection in maintaining species barriers.      Chapter Three focused on the genetic consequences of large-scale environmental change. I developed new techniques using mRNA sequencing and ancestral state reconstruction to estimate rates of structurally stabilizing substitutions in blue mussels. I found that warm-adapted Mytilus galloprovincialis  have higher rates of stabilizing substitutions than cold-adapted M. trossulus, which suggests that natural selection can efficiently modify structural properties of proteins to fine-tune thermal tolerance based on small changes in temperature of just several °C. As a whole, my dissertation reiterates the importance of demographic processes in controlling the movement of genetic material during hybridization, indicates introgression may contribute to invasive success, and documents subtle natural selection for changes in protein properties of warm adapted M. galloprovincialis.

T1  - Effects of photoperiod and acclimation temperature on critical thermal maxima and minima of Dusky pipefish, <i>Syngnathus floridae</i>
AN  - 1650644022
AB  - Dusky pipefish (Syngnathus floridae Jordan and Gilbert, 1882) living in shallow water environments in the northwest Gulf of Mexico are exposed to marked changes in seasonal and daily water temperatures. The study of temperature and photoperiod effects on syngnathid thermal tolerance, however, is limited and contradictory. In this study, Dusky pipefish were acclimated to temperature and photoperiod combinations representative of summer, winter, and spring/fall seasons in northern Florida. Critical thermal methodology (CTM) was used to test photothermal treatment effects on upper and lower temperature tolerance. Acclimation temperature and photoperiod were found to be statistically influential and interactive. Simple effects analyses determined acclimation temperature had a statistically significant effect on pipefish behavior, with thermal tolerance increasing with increasing temperature. Photoperiod effects were significant, but inversely related to day length, such that longer summer day lengths decreased thermal tolerance. These data suggest that thermal pipefish tolerance is influenced more by ambient water temperatures than by day length. Additional work on Dusky pipefish responses to fluctuating thermal regimens and increasing exposure time may provide a better understanding on the evolutionary selective pressures shaping the thermal ecology of Dusky pipefishes across their geographic range.

T1  - Genetic bases and phenotypic consequences of high-temperature adaptation in <i>Escherichia coli</i>
AN  - 1648732462
AB  - Connecting phenotype to genotype and fitness has been a major challenge when studying adaptation. Experimental evolution is a powerful method to facilitate the study of adaptation as an outcome and as a process. This dissertation used 114 clones of Escherichia coli that were evolved independently for 2000 generations under thermal stress (42.2ºC). The goal of my dissertation was to link phenotypes and fitness with specific mutations and to identify the functional mechanisms leading to thermal adaptation.     Chapter 1 focused on a subset of populations that became resistant to an antibiotic, rifampicin, during thermal stress adaptation. Rifampicin resistance was caused by three mutations at codon position 572 of the rpoB gene, which encodes the beta subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP). I used samples from 200 generation intervals to assess the frequency trajectory of rifampicin resistance. I found that resistant mutations typically appeared, and were fixed, early in the evolution experiment. Finally, I confirmed that the three mutations conferred high advantage in glucose-limited medium at 42ºC in the ancestral background.     Chapter 2 investigated the same rpoB mutations in codon 572 to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying their fitness improvement at high temperature. I measured their growth curves and gene expression (mRNAseq) at 42ºC, and compared them to the growth and gene expression of the ancestor at 37ºC and 42ºC. Two rpoB mutations restored the gene expression back to an ancestral state, while one mutation, exaggerated the expression changes of the ancestor at 42ºC. Lastly, I compared the phenotypic characteristics of one single mutant, I572L, to those of two high-temperature adapted clones with this mutation. I concluded that the I572L9 mutation contributed to most of the expression changes while later mutations did not substantially changed gene expression.     Chapter 3 explored the phenotypic consequences of high temperature adaptation in 114 clones. I measured the magnitude of fitness trade-offs across a thermal gradient. I identified two niche dynamics that I associated with two genetic pathways. Overall, my dissertation associates mutations to phenotypes in the context of thermal stress adaptation, and it highlights the difficulties of connecting genotype to phenotype, even if in a "simple" experimental system.

T1  - Combinatorial effects of corexit 9500A and temperature stressors on embryo development in the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
AN  - 1647743615
AB  - To reduce possible ecological impact from oil spill events, the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500A is approved for widespread application. Concerns about toxic effects of dispersant on aquatic fauna have prompted numerous recent toxicological studies. Few of these studies have considered possible interactive effects involving Corexit exposure at normative or high temperatures associated with normal breeding seasons of many aquatic organisms. We examined development, survival, and hatch success of teleost model Danio rerio  embryos exposed to Corexit while maintained at various temperatures. Calculated LC25, 50, and 75 values at 24 h Corexit exposure for 3 hpf embryos reared at the standard husbandry temperature of 28.5°C were 71.0, 110.4, and 171.7 ppm, respectively (Probit analysis, n=5 trials of 10 individuals each). Another cohort of 3hpf embryos was exposed to concentrations of Corexit (0, 80, 125, and 150 ppm for 24 h) at varying temperatures (24.7, 27.0, 29.5, and 31.7oC), representing higher thermal limits. Following exposure for 8 or 24 hrs, embryos were transferred into control media and observed at 27, 57 and 75 hpf. Exposure to higher Corexit concentrations and temperatures resulted in decreased survivorship compared to the lower concentrations and temperatures below 28.5°C, with the outcomes affected primarily during the exposure period. The incidence of phenotypic abnormalities increased with increasing Corexit concentrations and temperature. For embryos surviving the 24 h exposure, successful hatching started by 27 hpf for all Corexit concentrations at 31.7°C. A cohort of 57 hpf early larvae were exposed to concentrations of Corexit (0-200 ppm for 24 h). Hatched larvae showed a greatly reduced sensitivity to Corexit exposure (LC50 > 200 ppm) as compared to embryos. These data suggest that high temperature, as an environmental stressor, can exacerbate the effects of Corexit 9500A. Presuming other fish have similar sensitivities, it is possible that Corexit, particularly if applied in the summer when temperatures are elevated, could affect fish population demographics and, as a consequence, community structure.

T1  - The role of CREB in the liver and adipose tissue
AN  - 1647473315
AB  - Excessive hepatic glucose production is a hallmark of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.  The cAMP-responsive transcription factor cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), thought to be a key activator of the hepatic gluconeogenic gene regulation program, has been suggested as therapeutic target to reduce glucose output by the liver.  Here, I test directly the requirement for hepatocytic CREB for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis utilizing Cre-loxP for conditional, cell-type specific gene ablation. Strikingly, I find no difference in fed and fasted glucose levels, or glucose, insulin, and glucagon tolerance in mice fed normal chow or a high-fat diet in hepatocyte Creb-null mice compared to controls.  In addition, mRNA levels of liver specific genes, including several CREB target genes involved in gluconeogenesis, were not affected by CREB deficiency in the liver. In conclusion, my data indicate that CREB has no non-redundant functions in hepatic glucose metabolism, and is therefore not likely to be a useful target for the development of anti-diabetic drugs.     Furthermore, lipolysis and thermogenesis are regulated by catecholamines signaling via β-adrenergic receptors in adipose tissue and a role for the CREB in adipocyte function had been suggest by previous studies. However the role of CREB in adipose tissue had never been evaluated in vivo.  Here, I test directly the requirement for adipocyte CREB for lipolysis and thermogenesis using the Cre-loxP system for adipocyte-specific ablation of Creb in mice. Loss of adipocytic Creb  lead to a moderate decrease in fasting-induced lipolysis in adipose tissue. Strikingly, the adipocytic transcriptome was not globally affected by ablation of Creb. In addition, cold temperature and cAMP signaling-induced thermogenesis and white-to-beige adipocyte conversion were not changed in adipocyte specific Creb-null mice compared to controls. In conclusion, my data indicate that CREB has no non-redundant functions in thermogenesis, but contributes to the regulation of fasting-induced lipolysis. The underlying mechanism of reduced fasting-induced lipolysis in adipocytic CREB-deficient mice will need to be explored further.

T1  - Here be dragons: Functional analyses of thermal adaptation and biogeography of reptiles in a changing world
AN  - 1627780337
AB  - Environments around the world are changing rapidly and a major challenge for modern biologists is to understand how these changes affect organisms, communities, and ecosystems. Ideally, we would like to predict which taxa/populations are likely to remain stable, increase, or decline in response to predicted environmental perturbations. This information will allow us to create informed management plans and will provide insight into the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape biodiversity. For my Ph.D. dissertation, I examined factors that mediate the responses of reptile populations to rapid changes in the thermal environment, explored the ability of these factors to shift through phenotypic plasticity and evolution, and examined the power of a phenotypically plastic behavioral response to buffer populations from thermal environmental change.      In Chapters 2–4, I explored the evolutionary history and physiology of alligator lizards (Elgaria coerulea, E. multicarinata, and E. panamintina, family Anguidae) to identify mechanisms that mediate their responses to changing thermal environments. First, I integrated morphological data and species distribution modeling with prior molecular data to examine alligator lizard taxonomy. My results support the species status of E. panamintina and the existence of two cryptic taxa within E. multicarinata. Next, I examined the thermal physiology of confirmed alligator lizard taxa and explored the biogeographical implications of their thermal physiology. Adult alligator lizards are active at virtually identical body temperatures even though species occur in very different thermal environments, suggesting average differences in environmental temperature are not limiting. To examine whether extreme temperatures might be more limiting, I examined the effects of extreme temperatures on the physiological stress response of alligator lizards. My results suggest that the thermal-stress response in alligator lizards is species specific and might be important for limiting alligator lizard biogeography. However, adults might not be the most thermally sensitive life-history stage. Thus, I also examined the effects of temperature during alligator lizard development and compared embryonic and adult thermal physiologies. My results suggest that the thermal physiology of alligator lizards changes across their ontogeny and embryonic thermal tolerances are more limiting than adult thermal tolerances. Together, my results suggest that relatively extreme thermal environments and the developmental thermal environment will have the greatest influence on how alligator lizards respond to changes in the thermal environment.    As environments change, many species may be able to respond adaptively through phenotypic plasticity, thereby countering any negative consequences of shifting environments. For example, the most common biotic response to ongoing global climate change is a plastic shift in spring phenology. While altered spring phenology is viewed as an adaptive response to changing thermal environments, this issue has not been examined directly. To test this hypothesis, in Chapter 6, I constructed a mechanistic model examining the power of shifting spring phenology to buffer populations from climate change, and examined this model using data on painted turtles (Chrysemys picta, family Emydidae), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination. Somewhat surprisingly, the model suggested that advancing phenology is a poor buffering mechanism, and only effectively counters the negative consequences of < 1.0 °C increase in environmental temperature.    In combination, my dissertation explores the diverse processes that mediate responses of reptiles to rapid changes in thermal environments such as those predicted to occur as a result of global climate change. This information is necessary to better understand effects of major environmental changes on the ecology and evolution of species as well as for making accurate predictions for conservation/management.

T1  - Heat stress alters animal physiology and post-absorptive metabolism during pre- and postnatal development
AN  - 1627188446
AB  - Heat stress (HS) is a key limiting factor to efficient animal production and negatively impacts health and development during postnatal life. In addition, hyperthermia during in utero development can permanently alter postnatal phenotypes and negatively impact future animal performance. While the teratogenic effects of prenatal HS have been extensively evaluated, the impact of in utero HS exposure on future mammalian thermoregulation, nutrient partitioning, and bioenergetics is undefined. To determine the postnatal consequences of in utero HS, pregnant first parity sows and rats were exposed to either thermal neutral (TN) or HS conditions for the entire gestation, the first half, or second half of gestation. To account for differences in maternal nutrient intake, we utilized an  ad libitum TN control group and a pair-fed TN control group of rats. Progeny were evaluated for differences in production performance, nutrient partitioning, thermoregulation, and post-absorptive metabolism. In a series of experiments, it was determined that prenatal HS exposure increased postnatal adipose deposition at the expense of skeletal muscle mass and permanently increased core body temperature during future development. When compared with  in utero HS-exposed rats, pair-fed TN exposed progeny had increased adipose tissue and reduced lean tissue mass. In opposition to some previously published reports, postnatal HS exposure seems to reduce maintenance costs, which may have implications toward energy efficiency during times of thermal stress.  In summary, HS modifies animal metabolism and physiology during both pre- and postnatal development and reduces livestock production efficiency.

T1  - Microevolution of the oxidative stress response: Organismal and transcriptomic effects of peroxide exposure in the starlet sea anemone <i> Nematostella vectensis</i>
AN  - 1626365543
AB  - The starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis  (phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa), inhabits tidal marshes along the Atlantic coast of North America. These shallow coastal habitats are subject to extreme environmental variability, including fluctuating levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). High ROS concentrations can be cytotoxic and lead to oxidative stress. Given the importance of tidal marshes for marine biodiversity and their susceptibility to oxidative stress, it is important to study how resident organisms counteract oxidative stress. N. vectensis is an excellent model system for addressing the evolution of oxidative stress mechanisms because (1) this anemone exhibits tolerance to a variety of environmental stressors, (2) there is clear evidence of local adaptation to stress in different populations and sub-populations, and (3) protein-coding polymorphisms have been identified, some in proteins that are implicated in stress response. I exposed fifteen different clone lines of N. vectensis collected from four estuaries to biologically relevant levels of hydrogen peroxide. Pronounced differences are apparent between clone lines collected from Meadowlands, NJ, Baruch, SC, and Kingsport, NS, as well as among twelve clones collected at a single Cape Cod marsh.  This is the first study that demonstrates intraspecific variation in the oxidative stress response of N. vectensis. To understand how the peroxide response of these clones might differ at the level of gene expression, I sequenced the transcriptomes of 7 clone lines under control conditions and when exposed to survivable levels of peroxide for 24 h. I found survivable peroxide exposure induces robust and repeatable changes in gene expression, including the up-regulation of genes shown to be associated with cellular responses to oxidative stress, thermal stress, and UV stress, and down-regulation of genes that promote generation of ROS, including the enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, I identified pronounced differences in the peroxide-induced transcriptional profiles between genets of N. vectensis. The existence of a conserved oxidative stress response has major implications for studies on how other cnidarians, particularly corals, will withstand the impacts of climate change. Indeed, the proximal cause of coral bleaching—the major threat to corals worldwide—is oxidative stress.

T1  - The roles of transient receptor potential channels in thermostatic behavior, in thermal acclimation, and in tonic immobility in the red flour beetle, <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)
AN  - 1620485184
AB  - Organisms are capable of sensing environmental conditions through diverse mechanisms. Transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) are a cation channel family that has been found to function in diverse sensing mechanisms. In this dissertation, I identified the function of several TRPs in thermosensing and mechanosensing in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Candidate TRPs were chosen based on homology to TRPs found and studied in  Drosophila melanogaster. To identify the function of candidate TRPs in T. castaneum, I suppressed the expression of target genes by RNA interference technique and investigated the phenotype of each treated beetle.     Temperature is a major limiting environmental factor for organisms. I tested the function of candidate TRPs in thermotaxis (behavior) and thermal acclimation (physiology). Using bioinformatics approaches, I identified three candidate TRPs - painless, pyrexia, and  trpA1 - involved in high temperature sensing. To test thermotactic behavior, I investigated beetle movement on a temperature arena with two separate temperature zones. Thermal acclimation was tested by pre-exposing beetles to either 42 °C for 10 min.  When treated with double stranded RNA of TRPA1 (dstrpA1), the thermotactic response of beetles at 39 and 42 °C was reduced when compared to control groups.  With pre-exposure at 42 °C, survivorship of dstrpA1-treated beetles significantly increased after one minute exposure at 52 °C compared to beetles that were not pre-exposed. With dspainless treatment, beetles showed lower response to thermal acclimation and lower long-term survivorship. Beetles treated with  dspyrexia showed lower recovery after heat treatment without pre-exposure at 42 °C.     To identify the function of candidate TRPs in mechanosensing, I evaluated dsRNA treated beetles for survival, walking behavior, and tonic immobility. Treatment with dsnompC and dstrpA5 resulted in failure in eclosion, causing 93 % mortality in both treatments. Survivors in dsnompC showed defects in elytra sclerotization. In dsnanchung  and dsinactive treatments, adults showed abnormal walking behavior and reduced walking speed that were likely caused by defects of mechanosensing in folding of the joint between the femur and tibia. For tonic immobility, beetles with dsnanchung, dsinactive, dswaterwitch  and dsick2 (insect cytokine 2) treatments showed increased sensitivity to mechanical stimulation leading to tonic immobility.

T1  - Using Benthic Indicator Species and Community Gradients to Optimize Restoration in the Arid, Endorheic Walker River Watershed, Western USA
AN  - 1618232958
AB  - The challenge of restoring watersheds in arid regions often requires the development of novel scientific tools to guide management. The Walker Basin Program was created to reverse ecological decline in an arid, endorheic watershed through scientifically guided restoration. As part of this program, three years of benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected seasonally at ten sites that represent the diversity of river environments from the high mountain headwaters to a desert terminal lake.  Samples were analyzed to quantify baseline conditions in reference and degraded reaches of river and identify opportunities and constraints for aquatic community restoration. Naturally harsh environments in the lower river characterized by high temperatures and low base flow combined with a weak understanding of reference conditions to limit the utility of commonly used indices for quantifying biotic integrity. A flexible approach was employed using a combination of indicator species analysis, cluster analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and community tolerance indices to evaluate the variation of benthic macroinvertebrate community composition across a set of environmental gradients. Results demonstrate that benthic communities in the watershed are primarily influenced by a longitudinal gradient related to elevation. A strong secondary community gradient caused by anthropogenic nutrient loading may constrain restoration effectiveness in some parts of the watershed. Restoration activities should improve water quality conditions and initially target areas of the watershed less affected by nutrient loading. Results also demonstrate that benthic communities shift longitudinally. These shifts should be monitored to inform adaptive management of restoration actions.

T1  - Microbial ecology of a manmade oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and a natural, hydrothermal oil seep in the Gulf of California
AN  - 1613182914
AB  - Members of the Marinobacter genus play an important role in hydrocarbon degradation in the ocean – a topic of special significance in light of the recent Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. The Marinobacter group has thus far lacked a genus level phylogenetic probe that would allow in situ identification of representative members. Here, two new 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes (Mrb-0625-a and Mrb-0625-b) were developed to enumerate Marinobacter species by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In silico analysis of this probe set demonstrated 80% coverage of the Marinobacter genus. A competitor probe was developed to block hybridization by Mrb-0625-a to six Halomonas species with which it shared a one base pair mismatch. The probe set was optimized using pure cultures, and then used in an enrichment experiment with a deep sea oil plume water sample collected from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Marinobacter  cells rapidly increased as a significant fraction of total microbial abundance in all incubations of original contaminated seawater as well as those amended with n-hexadecane, suggesting this group may be among the first microbial responders to oil pollution in the marine environment. The new probe set will provide a reliable tool for quantifying Marinobacter  in the marine environment, particularly at contaminated sites where these organisms can play an important role in the biodegradation of oil pollutants.    The next sections of this dissertation focus on the hydrothermally active sediments at Guaymas Basin, which show a wide range of shallow subsurface temperatures: from 3°C to 200°C in the first 45 cm depth. A combination of extreme thermal gradients and compressed geochemical and metabolic zones limits the depth range of microbial colonization in Guaymas sediments. Using stable carbon isotopic values for methane and dissolved inorganic carbon compared to associated temperatures the upper thermal limits for the anaerobic oxidation of methane and organic carbon remineralization in Guaymas sediments are suggested to be 80oC and 100oC, respectively. At higher temperatures the isotopic imprints of these microbially mediated processes cannot be detected. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene clone libraries demonstrate differential biogeographical zonation patterns for archaea versus bacteria, with archaeal community structure being more heavily influenced by hydrothermal regimes. Chloroflexi  and Deltaproteobacteria dominated the bacterial clone libraries, and anaerobic methane-oxidizing (ANME) archaea represented nearly half of the total archaeal clone library. Thermal zonation of ANME archaeal subgroups is strong: ANME-2c is restricted to low temperature sediments (<25°C), ANME-1 is dominant at warmer temperatures, and the ANME-1 Guaymas archaea appear to have access to the deepest and hottest sediment horizons up to approximately 80°C.   In the last chapter of this dissertation, microbial life at extreme temperatures was investigated further by RNA-based methodologies. Using push core samples collected by the Alvin submarine at four high temperature sites with 40-cmsbf thermal maxima ranging from 100°C to 185°C, the composition of the active microbial community and its possible influence on carbon and sulfur cycling was investigated. Here, evidence is presented indicating that hydrothermal fluctuations are frequent enough to restrict hyperthermophilic life to sediments with average in situ temperatures between 70°C and 95°C, where temperatures may vary by 25°C in as little as a day. Strong microbially mediated sulfate reduction is implicated by sharp decreases in porewater sulfate within the upper 15 cm of all four high temperature cores, while stable isotopic evidence of methane oxidation is only expressed in a single core. Archaeal sequence recovery was greater than bacterial sequence recovery in six out of eight samples from the four cores, but bacterial sequence recovery was particularly strong for a single core, yielding 35% of the total archaeal and bacterial recovery from all samples. Although putative anaerobic methane oxidizing (ANME) archaea were very common, distinct cores hosted diverse and distinct sequence assemblages, including ANME-1 Guaymas, ANME-2c, and ANME-2d/GoM Arc-1 /Methanoperedenaceae. Dominant bacterial groups fell within the  Thermodesulfobacteriaceae family in the Thermodesulfobacteria  phylum, the Helicobacteriaceae family in the subphylum  Epsilonproteobacteria, or were close relatives of Desulfocapsa exigens in the subphylum Deltaproteobacteria. The most probable thermo- or hyperthermophilic groups were investigated by co-occurrence of OTUs across the four hottest samples within the sediment cores and appear to be ANME-1 Guaymas and an uncultured representative of the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotal Group (MCG)-15 for archaea, and members of the Thermodesulfobacteriaceae  family for bacteria.

T1  - Genetic and metabolic bases of thermal plasticity in <i> Drosophila</i>
AN  - 1564754097
AB  - Variation in the thermal environment challenges homeostasis, and organisms respond via physiological and behavioral processes. These strategies are fueled by metabolism, a set of biochemical reactions which themselves directly respond to temperature. Together these dynamics can create complex genotype-by-environment interactions, particularly for mutations affecting energy use. Using the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, I have investigated how genetic variation in energy metabolism underlies variation in genotype-phenotype-environment relationships. Following an introductory chapter, the first chapter of my PhD quantifies the cost of expressing extra gene copies in the context of inducible, protective responses to stressful environments. Compared to the energetic costs of other adaptive mechanisms, the energetic costs associated with high expression of duplicate gene copies could limit the potential of gene duplicates as a source of mutations for adaptation. The third chapter of my thesis identifies the metabolic basis for the temperature-dependence of an epistatic mitochondrial-nuclear genetic interaction in Drosophila.  Cold development temperatures mitigate the deleterious effects of these interacting mitochondrial-nuclear mutations, but cold does not fully rescue metabolic plasticity of developing larvae. This provides strong evidence for a genetic basis to metabolic plasticity, and delineates limits of developmental plasticity for metabolic rate in Drosophila. For the final chapter of my thesis, I show that varying developmental photoperiod results in similar environment-dependent effects on mitochondrial-nuclear interactions as those found by varying development temperature. This result indicates that the deleterious consequences of this mitochondrial-nuclear interaction depend broadly on variation in the energetic demand of development, rather than directly on the thermal-sensitivity of the interacting mutations. In summary, my thesis research identifies mechanisms underlying variation in environmental responses, explores regulatory mechanisms that govern the expression of genetic variance, and defines limits of developmental plasticity in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.

Nutrient availability governs post-embryonic development in Caenorhabditis elegans: larvae that hatch in the absence of food do not initiate post-embryonic development but enter "L1 arrest" (or "L1 diapause") and can survive starvation for weeks, while rapidly resume normal development once get fed. Insulin-like signaling (IIS) has been shown to be a key regulator of L1 arrest and recovery. However, the C. elegans genome encodes 40 insulin-like peptides (ILPs), and it is unknown which peptides participate in nutritional control of L1 arrest and recovery. Work in other contexts has identified putative receptor agonists and antagonists, but the extent of specificity versus redundancy is unclear beyond this distinction.    We measured mRNA expression dynamics with high temporal resolution for all 40 insulin-like genes during entry into and recovery from L1 arrest. Nutrient availability influences expression of the majority of insulin-like genes, with variable dynamics suggesting complex regulation. We identified 13 candidate agonists and 8 candidate antagonists based on expression in response to nutrient availability. We selected ten candidate agonists (daf-28, ins-3, ins-4, ins-5, ins-6, ins-7, ins-9, ins-26, ins-33 and ins-35) for further characterization in L1 stage larvae. We used destabilized reporter genes to determine spatial expression patterns. Expression of candidate agonists was largely overlapping in L1 stage larvae, suggesting a role of the intestine, chemosensory neurons ASI and ASJ, and the interneuron PVT in systemic control of L1 development. Transcriptional regulation of candidate agonists was most significant in the intestine, as if nutrient uptake was a more important influence on transcription than sensory perception. Scanning in the 5' upstream promoter region of these 40 ILPs, We found that transcription factor PQM-1 and GATA putative binding sites are depleted in the promoter region of antagonists. A novel motif was also found to be over-represented in ILPs.   Phenotypic analysis of single and compound deletion mutants did not reveal effects on L1 recovery/developmental dynamics, though simultaneous disruption of ins-4 and daf-28 extended survival of L1 arrest without enhancing thermal tolerance, while overexpression of  ins-4, ins-6 or daf-28 shortened L1 survival. Simultaneous disruption of several ILPs showed a temperature independent, transient dauer phenotype. These results revealed the relative redundancy and specificity among agonistic ILPs.   TGF- β and steroid hormone (SH) signaling have been reported to control the dauer formation along with IIS. Our preliminary results suggest they may also mediate the IIS control of L1 arrest and recovery, as the expression of several key components of TGF-β and SH signaling pathway genes are negatively regulated by DAF-16, and loss-of-function of these genes partially represses daf-16 null phenotype in L1 arrest, and causes a retardation in L1 development.   In summary, my dissertation study focused on the IIS, characterized the dynamics and sites of ILPs expression in response to nutrient availability, revealed the function of specific agonistic ILPs in L1 arrest, and suggested potential cross-regulation among IIS, TGF-β signaling and SH signaling in controlling L1 arrest and recovery. These findings provide insights into how post-embryonic development is governed by insulin-like signaling and nutrient availability.

T1  - Spatial heterogeneity of stink bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) populations in agricultural systems
AN  - 1559962057
AB  - Knowledge on spatial patterns of insect pest populations and the ecological processes influencing these patterns can be directly applied to the management of pests in agricultural systems. Recent increases in stink bug populations, importantly the invasive Halyomorpha halys (Stål 1855), has caused unprecedented economic losses in the mid-Atlantic United States. To inform integrated pest management programs, I quantified the spatial heterogeneity of stink bug population density in field crops at multiple spatial scales (field edge, entire fields and regional), and identified the associated environmental factors and the underlying ecological mechanisms (i.e. climatic tolerances, resource quality and availability).     At corn and soybean field edges, highest density of stink bugs was limited to the first few crop rows. At some study sites, fields adjacent to woods and buildings harbored higher density of stink bugs than those adjacent to open areas. Injury to corn kernel damage, and soybean pod and seed increased with stink bug density, and was highest at the field edges. Stink bug density was also positively associated with yield loss in soybean.     In entire fields of corn-soybean, H. halys was found in very low density or absent beyond 25m from the field edge. At study sites with high stink bug populations, interpolated density values showed potential dispersal of H. halys, particularly adults and large nymphs, from corn into soybean, coinciding with the end of dough stage in corn and beginning of soybean seed development stage.      Temperature and developed areas, and proportion of forest and crop areas were important predictors of regional patterns in H. halys and Chinavis hilaris abundance, respectively. For  Euschistus servus, temperature and forest cover influenced patterns at broad spatial scale. Adjacent habitat influence, with highest abundance along woods, on stink bug density was limited to within field scale, and difference in abundance between sites was driven primarily by temperature gradient.     These results directly inform field level stink bug management strategies through planting date and orientation of fields in the landscape, and for timing and intensity of treatments, as well as area-wide management. This research also identified roles of temperature and landscape in facilitating or impeding invasive pest populations.

T1  - Genomics and physiological evolution of cold tolerance in <i> Drosophila melanogaster</i>
AN  - 1559118482
AB  - Thermal stress impacts animals around the globe and understanding how organisms adapt to changes in temperature is of particular interest under current climate change predictions. My research focuses on the evolutionary genetics involved in cold tolerance and plasticity of cold tolerance using both artificially selected and naturally segregating populations, while tying the genes of interest to their physiological components. First I address cross-tolerance of stress traits following artificial selection to a non-lethal cold tolerance metric, chill-coma recovery. Using these artificial selection populations, we found that stress traits such as desiccation tolerance, starvation tolerance, acclimation, and chronic and acute cold tolerance do not correlate with level of cold tolerance as defined by chill-coma recovery time. We next assessed lifetime fitness of these different cold tolerance lines and found that only at low temperatures did fitness differ among cold tolerance levels. We then analyzed gene expression differences between resistant and susceptible populations at three time points to understand where selection pressures are hypothesized to act on genomic variation. Our gene expression analyses found many differences between resistant and susceptible lines, primarily manifesting themselves in the recovery period following cold exposure. We next utilized a community resource, the Drosophila melanogaster reference panel, to identify naturally segregating variation in genes associated with cold acclimation and fitness. We specifically asked if long- and short-term acclimation ability had overlapping genetic regions and if plasticity values from constant rearing environments were associated with demographic parameters in fluctuating environments. We found that long- and short-term acclimation are under unique genetic control and functionally tested several genes for acclimation ability. We also found that acclimation ability in constant environments and fitness in fluctuating environments do not correlate, but that genotypes are constrained in their fitness abilities between a warm and cool environment. Our analyses describe several novel genes associated with cold tolerance selection and long- and short-term acclimation expanding our knowledge of the complex relationship between demographic components and survivorship as well as a unique investigation of the change in gene expression during cold exposure.

T1  - Ice age fish in a warming world: Thermal acclimation capacity of lake trout (<i>Salvelinus namaycush</i>) populations
AN  - 1554698806
AB  - In the face of climate change, the persistence of cold-adapted species and populations will depend on their capacity for evolutionary adaptation of physiological traits. As a cold-adapted Ice Age relict species, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are ideal for studying potential effects of climate change on coldwater fishes. I studied the thermal acclimation capacity and aerobic metabolism of age 2+ lake trout from four populations across four acclimation temperatures (8ºC, 11ºC, 15ºC, and 19ºC). One population had marginally significant higher active metabolic rate (AMR) and metabolic scope across all temperatures. There was no interpopulation variation for critical thermal maximum (CTM), standard metabolic rate (SMR), or thermal acclimation capacity. Acclimation resulted in a 3ºC increase in thermal tolerance and 3-fold increase in SMR for all populations. At 19ºC, SMR increased and AMR declined, resulting in sharply reduced metabolic scope for all populations. The limited intraspecific variation in thermal physiology suggests that climate change may threaten lake trout at the species rather than population level.

T1  - Range limits, range shifts, and lower thermal tolerance in the tropical barnacle <i>Megabalanus coccopoma</i>
AN  - 1547742580
AB  - Climate change and species introductions are leading to shifts in marine species' geographic distributions.  However, few studies have examined range limits and range shifts in tropical marine species.  The barnacle  Megabalanus coccopoma is native to shorelines from Baja California to Peru and has been introduced to a number of locations worldwide including the Atlantic US SE coast, where its current introduced range extends from Ft. Pierce, FL to Cape Hatteras, NC with seasonal populations as far north as Kitty Hawk, NC.  In order to understand the potential poleward range limit of M. coccopoma in the US SE under modern day climate regimes, the larval and adult lower thermal tolerances were examined and larval energy budgets were used to estimate the potential extent of larval dispersal.  The distribution of M. coccopoma was then surveyed within the Atlantic US SE during the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012.  Changes in the range documented during these surveys were used to test the predictive accuracy of the species distribution model MaxEnt using data from the global range, the native range and the Atlantic US SE range.  In contrast to work done with temperate species, which suggests larval thermal tolerances often set range limits, adult thermal tolerances corresponded most closely to current range limits.  Larval energetic reserves may limit the extent of the seasonal range.  Surveys revealed that, following the cold winter months of 2010, the range of M. coccopoma retracted down to northern Florida, rapidly re-expanded during 2011 and was re-established in its previous range by the summer of 2012.  This range re-expansion is the fastest documented for any marine invertebrate and is one of the few documented for any tropical marine organism.  When MaxEnt was used to predict the range retraction and range limits of M. coccopoma, only the MaxEnt model trained on the US SE data was able to accurately predict both the range retraction and range limits prior to the range retraction.  Consideration of the range limiting mechanism(s) and spatial variation in the mechanism(s) is fundamentally important in accurately predicting range limits and even more so in predicting range shifts.  In many marine species, and particularly in tropical species, lower limits to functionality and cumulative chill damage are likely the mechanisms responsible for setting poleward range limits at above freezing temperatures.  Limited selection in tropical marine species for the ability to acclimate to cold temperatures may result in more ephemeral range expansions when compared to temperate species when both are moving poleward.

T1  - Local and regional controls of brook trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>) metapopulation dynamics within a complex Appalachian riverscape
AN  - 1529307871
AB  - Brook trout have recently become a species of conservation focus due to their unique spatial structure and restricted thermal requirements. These life history characteristics make brook trout particularly vulnerable to major biodiversity threats, such as climate change and habitat loss. For appropriate conservation actions to be taken, it is imperative to identify the scale that limits brook trout productivity. The popular view of brook trout ecology indicates that populations exist as isolated fragments within watersheds, where productivity is concentrated in small, cold tributaries. This has led to management resources being allocated towards small tributaries with a goal to enhance local habitat characteristics. However, recent evidence suggests broader spatial scales are equally important for appropriate management planning. Application of landscape ecology theory has indicated that some brook trout populations may demonstrate linked metapopulation structure, where productivity and population dynamics operate at the watershed scale. Contrasting views on the appropriate spatial scale limiting brook trout productivity must be resolved for effective conservation planning: are brook trout fragmented isolates within watersheds, limited by local resources, or are they linked metapopulations that rely on dispersal and population dynamics operating at regional scales?     The upper Shavers Fork watershed in West Virginia supports a historically productive brook trout fishery. However, numerous anthropogenic factors within this watershed have led to a drastic decline in the brook trout population. Loss of riparian vegetation and increasing temperatures due to climate change has reduced the amount of larger, more productive mainstem habitats available to supplement brook trout productivity. Additional isolation by impassible barriers (e.g. culverts perched above the stream bottom) limits the number of brook trout spawning tributaries that are well connected to high quality foraging mainstem locations. Lastly, poor buffering geology increases the susceptibility of many tributary spawning areas to acid precipitation. For my dissertation, I adopted a riverscape approach to better understand which factors limit brook trout productivity within this historically productive watershed. In particular, my dissertation is strongly focused on factors that limit brook trout use of the supplementary mainstem.      My first chapter applies multiple spatial population hypotheses to a longterm brook trout monitoring data set collected along a continuum of stream sizes. In particular, these hypotheses are based within a concept known as the abundant center hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts stronger density-dependent regulation at the core of a species distribution, while density-independent factors become the limiting mechanism with distance from the core.     The second chapter of this dissertation also used the same data set as analyzed in chapter one, but incorporated a regional analysis component to partition out the actual mechanism limiting brook trout productivity in the mainstem. Both source-sink dynamics (i.e. mass effects) and habitat limitation (i.e. thermal refugia) are equally likely factors controlling brook trout distributions within the mainstem. Therefore a series of models were ranked using information theoretic to explain brook trout densities and sizes along the core to periphery, with particular focus on the periphery.      The third chapter of this dissertation took advantage of a robust capture-mark-recapture data set within this watershed to identify the relative strength of different sources and sinks as contributors to the brook trout metapopulation. Often defining sources and sinks within a landscape is limited to a discrete categorical classification. However, identifying the habitats that provide the greatest contribution to the entire metapopulation would provide substantially greater benefit towards development of management strategies.      The fourth chapter of this dissertation was designed to model growth potential and habitat selection by brook trout within this watershed as a function of current and anticipated temperature regimes along a stream continuum. Habitat quality based on energetic potential has often been used to describe fish distributions at multiple spatial scales (i.e. microhabitat to the reach).  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)
