T1  - Physiology and ecology of three amphipod species in UK estuaries
AN  - 2033729922
AB  - The physiology and ecology of three amphipod species, Corophium volutator, Gammarus marinus and G. chevreuxi were examined. The physiology of the amphipods were investigated in two ways. The physiological capacity was measured as the rate of oxygen consumption (MO2 micro.l of oxygen per mg of wet mass per hour), over two time durations, 4 hours (short term) and 5 days (medium term) in a variety of salinities with individuals of all size classes. Overall, larger individuals of all species exhibited lower MO2 by mass. More specifically, C. volutator and G. chevreuxi exhibited lowest rates of respiration at salinities between 15 and 20ppt. G. marinus was found to have high mortality at 2 ppt, with high rates of respiration measured at 5 ppt. The second set of physiology experiments examined the effect of acclimation temperature, salinity and seasonality on the temperature limits of the three amphipod species. The critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and minimum (CTMin) were investigated using multiple endpoints for summer 2007 and winter 2008 using two test acclimation temperatures (10 and 20 gegrees C) and three test salinities (2, 20 and 35ppt). C. volutator had the highest CTMax, whereas G. marinus had the highest tolerance to cold temperatures with the largest temperature range. The CTMin for male G. chevreuxi was found to be significantly lower than females. The ecology of the three amphipod species was studied over a two year sampling period (June 2006 to June 2008) across 11 sites in three estuaries (Avon, Taw/Torridge and Plym). A large amount of variation in the densities was noted with the sex ratios for all species found to have a significant bias towards females at all sites. The density of G. chevreuxi fluctuated across site and date equally, compared to C. volutator which showed a strong spatial component and G. marinus which showed a strong temporal component. A model was developed to incorporate the results of the physiology and ecology investigations. A Binary Logistic Regression approach was adapted and occupancy was found to be a strong predictor of presence/absence data for all three species. The implications of this model are discussed in relation to a wider physiological and ecological context.

T1  - Physiological responses of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) to climate change parameters: Elevated temperature, drought and carbon dioxide.
AN  - 33826346; 200905-30-0080686 (CE)
AB  - Black spruce is a dominant North American boreal tree species that has large impacts on high latitude climate and carbon cycling. Growth of black spruce is strongly inhibited in warm years, and climate change may eliminate this species from much of its current range. This thesis addresses how black spruce responds to high growth temperatures, drought stress and CO(2) enrichment using greenhouses and growth chambers to vary growth conditions. Elevated temperatures reduced seedling growth and decreased the root to shoot ratio. Despite increased shoot allocation, warm-grown seedlings had smaller canopies and thinner needles with lower nitrogen content than cool-grown seedlings. Elevated growth temperatures reduced day and dark respiration, and photosynthesis. On a leaf nitrogen basis, photosynthesis showed little thermal acclimation, and the lower carbon gain of warm-grown seedlings was largely due to lower nitrogen content. The ratio of photosynthesis to respiration declined linearly with increasing temperature, implying that reduced carbon gain at elevated temperatures limits black spruce growth. Co-limitation of photosynthesis by Rubisco and RuBP regeneration predominated from 10--30degC, with no evidence for P(i) regeneration limitations. At high temperatures, photosynthesis appeared to be limited by Rubisco in warm-grown seedlings, but the limitation was unclear in cool-grown seedlings. High growth temperatures increased seedling thermotolerance; heat damage to needles did not occur below 50degC. In response to prolonged drought, declines in the maximum efficiency of photosystem II occurred at a water potential of -2 to -3 MPa, indicating damage to photosynthetic processes. Elevated growing temperatures reduced the water potential that damaged photosystem II from -2 MPa to -2.5 MPa, but caused seedlings to reach a damaging level of drought stress two to three days earlier than cool-grown seedlings. Photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO(2) can occur within 16 days in black spruce seedlings following high CO(2) exposure. An exponentially supplied high nutrient treatment did not affect the degree of down-regulation of photosynthesis to high CO(2). Exposure to elevated CO(2) during the first year of growth did not enhance growth the following year and had little effect on biomass over a five-year field study.

T1  - Seasonal changes in behavioural and thermoregulatory responses to hypoxia in the eastern chipmunk (<i>Tamias striatus</i>)
AN  - 304835966
AB  - Mammalian heterotherms, such as hibernators, are known to be more tolerant of low oxygen tensions than their homeothermic counterparts. It has been suggested that this relative hypoxia tolerance is related to their ability to deal with dramatic changes in body temperature during entry to and arousal from torpor. However, hibernators demonstrate dramatic seasonality in both daily heterothermy and overall torpor expression. It was of interest to test if seasonal comparisons of normothermic individuals within a single species with the capacity to hibernate produce changes in the response to hypoxia that would reflect a seasonal change in tolerance to low oxygen. In particular, the species studied, the Eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus ), is known to enter into torpor exclusively in the winter. To test for seasonal differences in the metabolic and thermoregulatory responses to hypoxia, flow-through respirometry was used to compare metabolic rate, minimum thermal conductance, body temperature, and a thermal gradient used to assess selected ambient temperature in response to hypoxia in both summer and winter acclimated animals. Although the animals periodically expressed torpor throughout the winter, no differences between season in resting metabolic rate, body temperature or minimum thermal conductance were observed in normoxia. The metabolic trials indicated that chipmunks are less responsive to hypoxia in the winter than they are in the summer. Although body temperature dropped in response to hypoxia in both seasons, the decrease was less in the winter, and there was no corresponding decrease in metabolic rate. Providing the animals with a choice of ambient temperatures in hypoxia resulted in a blunting of the drop in body temperature in both seasons, suggesting that the reported fall in body temperature set point in hypoxia is not fully manifested in the behavioural pathways responsible for thermoregulation in chipmunks. Instead, body temperature in hypoxia appears to be highly dependent on ambient temperature and oxygen concentration. The results of this study suggest that the season in which the responses to hypoxia are measured is important, especially in a heterotherm where seasonality can affect the degree to which the animal is tolerant of hypoxia. Winter-acclimated chipmunks appear more capable of defending metabolic heat production in hypoxia, a response consistent with the increased thermogenic capacity observed in animals that must periodically enter and arouse from torpor during hibernation.

T1  - Conceptual model development and testing of factors affecting select benthic macroinvertebrate metrics in select Ozark Highland streams
AN  - 304689025
AB  - In recent years the use of biological monitoring as a method for identifying anthropogenic impairments of aquatic systems has increased. With this increase in use a need for methods to identify the causes of those impairments has become apparent. The US EPA has developed a causal analysis system named CADDIS which is intended to direct investigations of biological impairment. A part of this system is the development of conceptual models of potential stressors. In late 2003 through early 2004 the University of Arkansas Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering conducted a study for EPA on selected stream segments in the Illinois and Kings River basins. The results of this study included multiple benthic macroinvertebrate impairments that did not exclusively correlate to targeted point source discharges. The initial steps of the CADDIS process were followed to create conceptual models of six identified candidate causes of impairment; toxic substances, low dissolved oxygen, trophic shift, increased scour, decreased interstitial habitat, and increased temperature. These models were tested using simple linear, pairwise, and multiple linear regression analysis of the benthic macroinvertebrate metrics, candidate causes of impairment, and intermediate model steps using data from the 2003-2004 EPA study. Analysis of the simple linear and pairwise results suggests that the models adequately represent the system. While no causality could be determined from this analysis the factor with the highest correlation to the macroinvertebrate metrics was temperature. Analysis of the multiple linear regression results indicate that though high R 2 values were found the regression models are not appropriate for this system and dataset. This was determined due to inconsistencies in the effects of the most influential variables in the regression models. To adequately model this system a larger and more robust dataset would be needed. Also a better understanding of the affects of specific stressors on the specific biotic communities of the Ozarks is needed. The development of regionally specific tolerance values as well as and overall Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity is also needed.

T1  - Diffuse flow chemistry and associated biological changes after an eruption at 9(degrees)50'North along the East Pacific Rise
AN  - 304628649
AB  - The hydrothermal vent system at 9°50’N along the East Pacific Rise (EPR) has been extensively studied since an eruption occurred in 1991. Following this eruption, the chemical environment and faunal succession was monitored for 15 years before another eruption occurred, between mid 2005 and early 2006. Several studies provided valuable information regarding the declining hydrothermal vent system (since the initial 1991 eruption), characterized by decreasing temperatures and sulfide concentrations and changes in the biological community structure (order of colonization from microbial mats to the tubeworms,  Tevnia jerichonana and Riftia pachyptila, to the mussels, Bathymodiolus thermophilus). The most recent eruption at 9°50’N EPR (2005-6) has provided the opportunity to study its transition from an old, declining hydrothermal vent system (pre-eruption) to a young hydrothermal vent system (post-eruption), marked by changes in the chemical conditions and biological community structure. Technological development of instrumentation along with an improved knowledge of the 9°50’N EPR location has allowed more detailed studies to be conducted involving the most recent eruption (2005-6) compared to previous research which followed the initial eruption (1991).    With the use of in situ voltammetry (using solid state gold amalgam microelectrodes) the chemical environment among organisms near diffuse flow sources was measured pre- and post-eruption (2005-6). The dominant megafauna present in 2004 and 2005 (pre-eruption) were mussels and  R. pachyptila tubeworms. These pre-eruption conditions were marked with decreasing median sulfide concentrations (53.4 µM among  R. pachyptila in 2004 to below the detection limit among  R. pachyptila in 2005). The chemical environment experienced by mussels had less sulfide (median sulfide concentration ranged from 0.7 µM in 2005 to 3.2 µM in 2004) than R. pachyptila (median sulfide concentrations ranged from below the detection limit in 2005 to 53.4 µM in 2004).    In 2006 and 2007 (post-eruption), the primary organisms observed were microbial mats and T. jerichonana tubeworms. The median sulfide concentrations ranged from 13.3 µM (among R. pachyptila in 2007) to 80.1 µM (among T. jerichonana in 2006), displaying the increase of sulfide following the eruption compared to pre-eruption conditions. A distinction between T. jerichonana and  R. pachyptila was observed regarding tolerance to microaerophilic conditions. T. jerichonana were observed to have a median O2 concentration that was below the detection limit (2007) whereas  R. pachyptila experienced a median O2 concentration of 57.7 µM (2007). This suggests possible differences in their blood chemistry and the possible use of the reductive TCA cycle under anaerobic or microaerophilic conditions.    The decreasing sulfide concentrations support that the hydrothermal vent system was declining prior to the eruption (2005-6). Also, the difference in chemical conditions pre- and post-eruption and the resulting order of megafaunal colonization indicates that chemistry significantly affects vent ecology.

T1  - Morphological and physiological developmental consequences of parental effects in the chicken embryo (<i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>) and the zebrafish larva (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
AN  - 304537773
AB  - Cardiac, metabolic and growth response of early-stage chicken embryos to perturbations in yolk environment was investigated. Also, effects of parental hypoxia exposure on hypoxia resistance, thermal tolerance and body length of zebrafish larvae were investigated.    In the first study, thyroxine, triiodothyronine and testosterone produced differential effects on heart rate and development rate of chicken embryos during the first 4 days of development. Triiodothyronine caused a dose-dependent increase in heart rate when applied at 40 or 70 hours of age, while thyroxine caused a dose-dependent increase in heart rate when applied at 40 hours only. Testosterone and propyl-thiouracil (deiodinase antagonist) did not have an effect on heart rate. Development rate was not changed by thyroxine, triiodothyronine, testosterone or propyl-thiouracil, which suggested that heart rate changes did not result from changes in embryo maturity. In the second study, chicken embryos exposed to yolks of different bird species during early-stage embryonic development showed changes in heart rate, mass-specific oxygen consumption and body mass that scaled with the egg mass, incubation period length, and yolk triiodothyronine and testosterone levels of the species from which yolk was derived. In the third study, this phenomenon was investigated between layer and broiler chickens. Heart rate, oxygen consumption and body mass of broiler and layer embryos were significantly changed by a breed-specific change in yolk environment. Yolk triiodothyronine and testosterone concentrations of broiler and layer eggs did not suggest that these hormones were responsible for physiological and morphological changes observed. The final study demonstrated that hypoxia resistance and body lengths, but not thermal tolerance of zebrafish larvae was increased by parental hypoxia exposure.

T1  - Thermoregulation and fluid balance in children exercising in the heat
AN  - 304504857
AB  - Numerous factors could affect a child’s physical performance, subjective comfort and/or physical well-being during exercise in the heat including hydration status, degree of heat acclimatization/acclimation and severity of environmental conditions. However, there is a dearth of empirically-based information examining the impact of these factors on the physiological and subjective responses of children exercising in the heat. This series of studies were designed to: (1) determine the effect of 2% (DEH) and 6% carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (CES) euhydration (EUH) compared with placebo (P) EUH on basketball skill performance in highly skilled young players; (2) determine the degree of natural acclimatization and artificially-induced acclimation-related changes during repeated exercise/heat bouts in 7 lean and 7 obese 9- to 12-yr-old boys during the summer months; and (3) determine the critical environmental limits for uncompensable heat stress, above which an imbalance between heat gain and heat loss forces body core temperature (Tc) upward for exercising, heat-acclimated lean and obese 9- to 12-yr-old boys.    Results from the first study suggest that in skilled 12- to 15-year old basketball players, deterioriation in basketball skill performance accompanies 2% dehydration and EUH with a 6% CES significantly improves shooting performance and on-court sprinting over EUH with water.    Findings from the second study suggest that obese compared to learn children are less naturally heat-acclimatized as indicated by significantly higher baseline Tc and display a significantly slower rate of decrease in exercise Tc and less of an elevation in sweating rate during repeated exercise/heat bouts.    Results from the third study study suggest that during light-to-moderate intensity exercise in a warm environment, the critical environments for heat-acclimated obese vs. lean 9- to 12-yr-old children will be shifted downward on a psychometric chart, toward a lower critical water vapor pressure. The critical water vapor pressure was identified by a continuous rise in Tc and was defined as the critical ambient water vapor pressure above which thermal balance could not be maintained during exercise. Therefore, separate critical environmental guidelines should be tailored to lean and obese children exercising in the heat.

T1  - Reproductive and larval biology of the northeastern Pacific polychaete <i>Owenia collaris</i> (Oweniidae) in Coos Bay, OR
AN  - 304498719
AB  - The polychaete worm Owenia collaris (Family Oweniidae) is found in soft sediment habitats along the northeastern Pacific coast, particularly within bays and estuaries. Seasonally, these small tubeworms spawn gametes freely into the water column where they develop into planktotrophic mitraria larvae. After three to four weeks at ambient temperatures, they undergo a dramatic metamorphosis and return to the bottom. The reproductive and larval biology of a population of O. collaris in Coos Bay, OR was investigated over several years. The development of this polychaete has several unusual features, including a stomodeum not derived from the blastopore and continued proliferation of trochoblast descendents, producing simple cilia on monociliated cells. The description of larval and juvenile structures provided morphological characteristics useful for distinguishing this species from the congener O. fusiformis. The consequences of the unusual larval morphology of O. collaris (i.e. simple cilia, convoluted ciliated band) were investigated by comparing the feeding performance and growth of this species with those of invertebrate larvae representative of the more typical tornaria-type larval forms found in deuterostomes and trochophore-type larval forms found in the lophotrochozoa. Feeding and growth patterns were similar in the convergent mitraria and deuterostome larval forms. In an experiment designed to test the relationship between abiotic factors and the seasonal reproduction, the onset of breeding was cued by photoperiod, but seasonal trends in temperature, alkalinity, food availability for larvae, and salinity may drive reproductive patterns as well. Within the Coos Bay estuary, the intertidal distribution of O. collaris is related to adult salinity tolerances. Low salinity limits horizontal distribution and also reduces potential for reproduction. Most life-history stages are tolerant of a wide range of temperatures, both higher and lower than those typically seen in Coos Bay. There is little evidence to support the hypothesis that sediment characteristics limit distribution within the bay, although settling juveniles show some preference for small grain sizes and may not be able to recruit to mudflats that completely lack these size fractions.

T1  - Resource allocation to growth and thermoregulation during early development in altricial nestlings
AN  - 304400407
AB  - Patterns of limited resource allocation to the mutually exclusive processes of growth and maintenance are products of natural selection and presumably confer fitness benefits. Hypothesized universal scaling of metabolic rate, growth, and resource allocation may not apply for altricial birds. Altricial birds grow rapidly by delaying thermal maintenance costs and preferentially allocating energy to growth. Endothermic nestling thermoregulation is aided by intermittent parental brooding. A general growth model was used as a null-model to test if deviations of altricial growth from universal patterns suggested energetic and fitness advantages. Differences between altricial and universal growth were not explained by changes in proportional water content of tissue or observed systematic increases in body temperature during ontogeny. Nestling body temperatures are maintained below 37°C for the first few days. Mass- and temperature-normalization of nestling metabolic rates suggest the rapid development of metabolic capacity may explain observed growth patterns, and thus deviations from universal patterns. The hypothesis that the altricial thermoregulatory strategy has a cost savings relative to the endothermic-at-hatch (precocial) alternative was tested for young house wren (Troglodytes aedon) nestlings. Nestling and parental thermoregulatory contributions were estimated from rates of wren broods cooling and heating under natural conditions, and costs for brood-level endothermy were modeled. Intermittent brooding was energetically cheaper than endothermy, ∼250 kJ savings or ∼168% over the first 5 days of development at moderate environmental temperatures, ∼21°C. Relative cost savings for brooding increased with lower environmental temperatures. Projected metabolic capacities necessary for endothermy are unrealistically high, up to 14-fold, for young nestlings in broods. The shift in the brooding strategy cost effectiveness coincides with the age when relative tissue water decreases and growth rate is maximum, suggesting a shift in preferential resource allocation from growth to maintenance. The hypothesis of temperature dependent growth was tested in wrens by experimentally increasing body temperatures ∼2°C for the first 7 days. No change in growth rate was observed suggesting that nestling metabolic and growth rates may be maximized. Because there is no growth rate advantage with higher temperatures, maintaining lower body temperatures for young nestlings is another cost savings of the altricial strategy.

T1  - Inhibition of protein kinase C restores morphine efficacy following excitotoxic spinal cord injury: Implications for the treatment of post-spinal cord injury pain syndromes
AN  - 304367842
AB  - The development of neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury occurs in up to 90% of patients within five years post-injury. The most common analgesic for the treatment of pain, morphine, exhibits significantly reduced efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The reduced efficacy of morphine in models of morphine tolerance has been related to changes in mu opioid receptor phosphorylation and protein kinase C levels. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to determine the relationship of changes in mu opioid receptor phosphorylation and protein kinase C levels to the development of overgrooming, which is believed to be a correlate of at-level neuropathic pain following excitotoxic spinal cord injury. The results demonstrate that decreased morphine efficacy following excitotoxic spinal cord injury can be related to increased phosphorylation of mu opioid receptor. Additionally, increased protein kinase C expression preceded increased mu opioid receptor phosphorylation. The administration of calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor, restored morphine efficacy in overgrooming animals following acute intracisternal injection and chronic intracisternal administration reduced the development of thermal hyperalgesia and maintained morphine efficacy.

T1  - Thermoregulatory responses during upper body exercise, thermal stress, training and heat acclimation
AN  - 301748963
AB  - The area of thermoregulation during upper body exercise has received limited research in able bodied individuals. The series of studies presented in this thesis investigated the effect of exercise intensity, duration and environmental temperature on thermoregulatory responses, including calf volume and blood flow, during upper body exercise and recovery. In order to manipulate these variables and observe the adaptive thermoregulatory responses, upper body training and heat acclimation were also performed. Chapter 4 examined the effect of exercise intensity (45, 60, 75Ã‚Â· and 90% peak power; Wpeak) on thermoregulatory responses during 5 min of upper body exercise. The results of this study suggest a redistribution of blood from the relatively'inactive lower body during arm exercise of intensities up to 60%Wpeak after which point calf volume did not 'I significantly decrease further. The calf volume decrease is possibly a result of vasoconstriction reducing blood pooling in the leg. Chapter 5 examined the effects of exercise duration (15,30, arid 45 min at 60%Wpeak) on thermoregulatory responses during and after upper body exercise. During upper body exercise at 60% Wpeak calf volume decreased up to 15 min with no further decrease thereafter. In all trials calf blood flow was greater at the cessation of exercise compared to rest suggesting hyperaemia occurred at the end of exercise. Chapter ~ examined the effects of exercise (30 min, 60%Wpeak) in different environmental temperatures (21, 27 ~nd 33Ã‚Â°C) on thermoregulatory responses. Calf skin blood flow from Laser Doppler measurements increased in all trials with a concomitant decrease in calf volume. The decrease in the calf volume..reported therefore reflected a greater and more substantial muscle vasoconstriction compared to increased skin blood flow. There was a greater decrease in calf volume during the 27Ã‚Â°C trial which appears to be, a result of a lower skin blood flow response compared to exercising in 33Ã‚Â°C. Chapter 7 examined the effect of 8 weeks of upper body training on thermoregulatory responses during upper body exercise. Upper body training reduced aural temperature and heat storage at a given power output as a result of increased whole body sweating and heat flow. Upper body training produced a smaller calf volume change after training at the same absolute exercise intensity demonstrating less leg vasoconstriction which was possibly as a result of a reduced response to sympathetic nervous activity or the fact that exercise was performed overall at a lower intensity post training (47% vs. 60%Wpeak). Chapter 8 examined the effect cSf exercising (30 min, 60%Wpeak) evrpry day in the h~at for 7 . '. days on'thermoregulatory responses to upper body exercise in the heat. There was reduced core temperature during exercise. The calf volume decrease was significantly greater during exercise in the heat following heat acclimation which may be a .result of increased vasoconstriction compensating, for an increase in skin blood flow to reduce venous pooling and therefore to maintain both stroke volume and blood flow to the skin. The lower body appears to have an important role in both cardiovascular stability as well as thermoregulation during upper body exercise.. It is proposed that this is achieved by reducing venous pooling in the calf thus increasing the availability of blood for maintaining stroke volume and increasing skin blood flow during exercise. The responses at the calf during exercise can be adapted through heat acclimation and upper body training.

T1  - Molecular responses to environmental stress in temperate and polar flies
AN  - 288458758
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms used by insects to survive stress is critical for understanding adaptations to the environment and may suggest future tools for pest management. To this end, two very different flies from different parts of the world were examined to determine how they deal with environmental stressors in their habitat. The insects examined include the fruit fly  Rhagoletis pomonella and the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica , two species that spend most of their immature period in the soil.    The apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella, is a major pest of domesticated apples. It can spend most of the year (~11 months) in the soil in a deep diapause. During this time, the pupae are vulnerable to the low temperatures of winter as well as the warm temperatures of early summer. In late summer, adults emerge and oviposit into apples, where the larvae spend several weeks. The larvae then drop to the soil and pupariate. Most pupae enter a deep diapause (300 d), some enter a shallow diapause (100 d), while others directly develop. We cloned and monitored expression of the genes encoding heat shock proteins (Hsps) 70 and 90, molecular chaperones involved in a wide variety of stress responses in insects. Larvae reared at 28°C for 2 weeks did not express Hsp70, but Hsp70 was highly upregulated in larvae reared at 35°C. Hsp90 was expressed in larvae reared at both temperatures. Infested apples were also placed in the field for a 24 hr period during August, and the Hsps were monitored. During this time, the core temperature of the apples exceeded 40°C for at least 2 hrs per day. Hsp70 was mildly upregulated in the field at 9:30 am and upregulation was maximal at 5:30 pm. By 11 pm Hsp expression again declined and by 6 am the next day there was no signal. Hsp90 was again constitutively expressed during the entire day, but a strong upregulation was also noted at 5:30 pm. Hsp expression was also noted during diapause. Diapausing pupae were sampled at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 250 days post pupariation. Hsp70 was expressed throughout diapause but was further upregulated at 120 d (deep diapause). This further upregulation correlates with the onset of winter and lower temperatures, suggesting a possible cold tolerance function for Hsp70 in this pupal diapause as documented for the pupal diapause of another fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis. Hsp90 was constitutively expressed throughout diapause. We thus provide evidence that certain Hsps cycle daily during larval development under field conditions, and their expression is developmentally upregulated during deep diapause.    The desiccation tolerance of the apple maggot was evaluated for the overwintering diapausing pupae. These pupae have water loss rates similar to that of another desiccation-tolerant fly pupae, Sarcophaga crassipalpis. To investigate the involvement of stress genes, we monitored expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 during dehydration. The antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, were cloned and also monitored during dehydration, heat shock and diapause. We found that Hsp70, SOD and catalase were strongly upregulated during dehydration, while Hsp90 was downregulated compared to the controls. SOD was downregulated but expressed at a constant low level throughout diapause. Catalase was also downregulated during diapause. SOD and catalase were upregulated in response to heat shock. These results suggest that Hsp70 is crucial in minimizing protein misfoldings and aggregation during periods of water loss, while SOD and catalase scavenge reactive oxygen species that are produced as a result of dehydration.    We also collected several thousand pupae from the field (Grant, MI) and placed them into laboratory conditions to generate direct developers, shallow diapausers and deep diapausers. We monitored weight, size and eclosion time to see if we could identify determinants of these three developmental programs. We found no correlation between weight and/or size with eclosion time or diapause incidence.    Larvae of the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica, spend nearly 11 months each year encased in a matrix of substrate and ice. During that time the larvae are exposed to the dehydrating conditions of being surrounded by ice, but they also experience numerous freeze and thaw cycles. Those conditions can lead to the generation of oxygen radicals, and thus we monitored the expression of antioxidant enzymes and heat shock proteins.

T1  - Slaves to the Eyring Equation? Temperature Dependence of Life-History Characters in Developing Ectotherms
AN  - 2463628315
AB  - This thesis investigates to what extent the thermodynamics of biological rates constrains the thermal adaptation of developing ectotherms. The biophysical Sharpe-Schoolfield model is applied to explain the temperature dependence of body size in ectotherms, to predict the temperature tolerance limits in developing ectotherms and to predict patterns of thermal adaptation within and among species. If the Sharpe-Schoolfield equation is applied to model the temperature dependence of growth and differentiation rate separately, then the temperature dependence of size at maturity follows from the interaction between these processes. Recent studies have shown that this approach provides an explanatory framework for all ectotherms, which obey the Temperature-size Rule, the observation that ectotherms at high temperatures grow and develop faster to a smaller size at maturity compared to low temperatures, but also to the exceptions of this rule. The Sharpe-Schoolfield equation basically consist of two parts: the numerator, which is formed by the Eyring equation, models the exponential increase of reaction rates with temperature based on reaction kinetics, and the denominator, which describes the reversible temperature-induced inactivation of enzymes. If the denominator is applied to a genetic control system of the cell cycle, it can be shown that the temperature tolerance limits are accurately predicted in range of insect species. It is argued that reversible temperature-induced inactivation of regulatory components of the cell cycle mimics the dosage change during the cell cycle. The Eyring equation is also successfully applied to cross-species comparisons of thermal adaptation in a large group of related frogs and toads. The recently developed model of Universal Temperature Dependence is critically discussed and it is argued that the predictions are partly based on incorrect assumptions and biased use of literature data. Furthermore, the supposed invariant biophysical parameters may vary in response to thermal adaptation. When ectotherms adapt to lower temperatures (horizontal shift) a correlated response occurs of a wider thermal range (specialist-generalist shift), a smaller slope (sensitivity shift) and lower activity (vertical shift). This correlated response is mainly determined by the Eyring equation. The enzyme activity-stability tradeoff is the most important thermodynamic constraint and limits the viable development of most ectotherms to a relative small thermal tolerance range of approximately 20°C. It is argued that this correlated response does not limit evolution within thermal environments, but instead may be one of the drivers of evolution and consequently biodiversity. The overall conclusion is that the biophysical Sharpe-Schoolfield equation is an excellent model to study thermal adaptation in ectotherms.

T1  - Macrozoobenthic and Fish Production of the Mondego Estuary: Anthropogenic and Climate Variability Impact
AN  - 2435821354
AB  - The major aim of the present thesis was to estimate the macrozoobenthic intertidal community and the dominant fish community production of the Mondego estuary. Such estimates allowed to assess the ecological integrity of the estuary, under anthropogenic and climate variability stress, and infer on the links between macrobenthos and fish. The thesis core was divided into four main chapters, focusing on: 1) the estuarine macrozoobenthic community production, where it was presented an overview of the main impacts occurring in the Mondego estuary over a ten-year study period, namely eutrophication and flood effects; 2) the population dynamics, regarding density, biomass and production, of Pomatoschistus minutus and Pomatoschistus microps, through an analysis of the real population dynamics (field study) and by the development of an ecological model to simulate that dynamics; 3) the links between macroinvertebrates and fish, by studying the fish diets; and 4) the estuarine production of resident and marine juveniles fish species using the estuary as nursery grounds (nursery species).In chapter I, empirical estimation methods were tested to be used for the computation of the macrozoobenthic community production. For this purpose, five estuarine species were used, each with a different life histories and abundances. Two areas, with contrasting anthropogenic activities impact, were tested. Brey (2001) version 4-04 produced the most satisfactory estimates, being considered the best methodology. Then, the assessment of the macrozoobenthic community production of the south arm of Mondego estuary over a ten year study period—1993 to 2002, enabled to evaluate the impact of macroalgal blooms and Zostera noltii decline, resulting from eutrophication. The success of a restoration programme implemented in 1998 could also be monitored. Before the mitigation measures of 1998, the Z. noltii beds declined gradually. In parallel, species richness, mean biomass and production of the macrozoobenthic community also decreased. After the management measures, the seagrass bed seemed to recover, along with a substantial increase in the mean biomass and production of the community for the whole intertidal area of the south arm of the Mondego estuary. Nevertheless, during this period, the occurrence of strong flood events (2001) induced a drastic reduction of the macrozoobenthic annual production. This study showed that the resilience of the macroinvertebrate populations may have been lowered by a prior disturbance history (eutrophication) and consequent interactions of multiple stressors.In chapter II, the population dynamics of P. minutus and P. microps was assessed from June 2003 to May 2006, in order to understand the ability of these species to withstand environmental variability, particularly during extreme climate events. Increasing drought conditions were observed, starting with a normal hydrological year in 2003 and attaining a severe drought in 2005. This resulted in low freshwater discharges mainly in 2005. Occasionally, abnormal high water temperatures were observed. During the drought year, non-expressive recruitments and the quick disappearance of the parental cohort were observed for P. minutus. This translated into a clear decrease in the fish density and production. For P. microps, the correspondent decrease was not so pronounced. No direct effects were attributable to the salinity and temperatures variations. Yet, the hypothesis of higher predation pressure on P. minutus was raised since the higher salinity incursion in the estuary increased the piscivorous marine adventitious species. These were more often in the downstream areas, where P. minutus distributed. Pomatoschistus microps benefited from a wider temperature and salinity range tolerance, allowing the species to occupy different estuarine areas. Therefore, P. microps seemed more adapted to withstand the environmental variability during the study period. Subsequently, an ecological model to simulate the population dynamics of the Pomatoschistus spp. studied previously, regarding density and biomass, was developed having as baseline the three-year field study mentioned above. The model comprised two sub-models: 1) an individual growth; and 2) a population dynamics (density) of juveniles and adults. These two sub-models were then coupled to form a cohort model (density and biomass). The cohorts were grouped, and again coupled according to the fish recruitments, to simulate their population. Results predicted by the model were in agreement with the field results. This approach also allowed to formulate hypotheses regarding possible restriction effects of the drought on the fish population development.The diet of 14 species from the fish community was assessed in chapter III. The most important prey were invertebrates with several polychaetes (Nephtys spp., Capitellidae, Spionidae, Eunicidae), Corophium spp. and Crangon crangon among the dominant ones. Pomatoschistus spp. were the most preyed fish and calanoid copepods (mainly Acartia spp.) were the most preyed plankton species. Several fish species showed a tendency for a specialized diet. Yet, almost all fish also showed some degree of opportunistic behaviour, as they preyed on other food resources. High diet overlap was found between some fish species but exploitative competition for food resources could not be concluded.Finally, in chapter IV, the production of the resident (P. minutus and P. microps) and nursery species (Dicentrarchus labrax, Platichthys flesus, Solea solea) was assessed from June 2003 to May 2006. These species comprised about 70% of all the fish community, both in numbers and biomass. In general, production was lower in the Mondego estuary, compared to other systems, which was probably due to its small area. Production decreased in the drought year, especially for D. labrax, P. minutus and P. flesus. Again, no direct effects could be attributable to the salinity and temperature variations and to the low freshwater discharges (resulting from the drought and high temperatures). Yet, these were pointed as the probable major reasons for the decreased production: directly due to the tolerances of each species and indirectly thorough a potential higher predation pressure. A significant reduction of the potential estuarine production to be exported for coastal areas by nursery species was also estimated for drought conditions.Alternate abstract:A presente tese teve como principal objectivo estimar a produção da comunidade macrozoobentónica intertidal e a produção da comunidade ictiológica dominante do estuário do Mondego. Por sua vez este estudo visou compreender os efeitos de impactos antropogénicos e de origem climática no estuário, e inferir acerca das relações entre os invertebrados macrobentónicos e os peixes em estudo. Com efeito, a estrutura da tese compreendeu quatro capítulos principais em que foram estudados 1) a produção estuarina da comunidade macrozoobentónica intertidal, em que foi apresentado um historial dos principais impactos no estuário do Mondego ao longo de dez anos de estudo, nomeadamente os efeitos da eutrofização e efeitos de cheias; 2) a dinâmica populacional, no que respeita a densidade, biomassa e produção, de Pomatoschistus minutus e Pomatoschistus microps, através de uma análise da dinâmica real da população (dados de campo) e através de um modelo ecológico desenvolvido para simular a referida dinâmica; 3) a relação entre os macroinvertebrados e os peixes, através da análise das dietas dos peixes; 4) a produção estuarina das espécies de peixes residentes e dos juvenis marinhos utilizando o estuário como área de viveiro.No capítulo I, foram testados métodos empíricos de produção, para serem utilizados no cálculo da produção da comunidade macrozoobentónica. Cinco espécies estuarinas foram utilizadas para o efeito, com diferentes histórias de vida e representatividade (abundâncias) no estuário, em duas áreas com condições ambientais contrastantes no que respeita ao impacto de actividades humanas. O método de Brey (2001) versão 4-04 produziu os resultados mais satisfatórios, sendo considerado o melhor método alternativo. Seguiu-se o cálculo da produção da comunidade macrobentónica intertidal do braço Sul do estuário, no período de 10 anos—1993 a 2002, permitindo avaliar o impacto dos blooms macroalgais e consequente declínio da macrófita Zostera noltii, bem como monitorizar o sucesso de um programa de recuperação ambiental implementado em 1998. Antes das medidas de mitigação de 1998, em paralelo com o declínio dos bancos de Z. noltii, a riqueza específica, biomassa média e a produção decresceram acentuadamente. Após as medidas de gestão, os bancos de Z. noltii pareceram recuperar gradualmente, concomitante com aumentos consideráveis na biomassa média e produção da comunidade macrobentónica em toda a área intertidal do braço sul do estuário do Mondego. No entanto, durante este período, a ocorrência de fortes cheias (em 2001) induziu a uma redução drástica da produção anual. Este estudo mostrou que a resiliência das populações de macroinvertebrados poderá ter sido comprometida pelo efeito da perturbação anterior no estuário (eutrofização) e consequente interacção de múltiplos agentes de stress.No capítulo II, a dinâmica populacional de P. minutus e P. microps foi estudada de Junho 2003 a Maio 2006, de forma a perceber como estas espécies reagem à variabilidade ambiental, em particular a efeitos climáticos extremos. Neste período, situações de seca foram graduais, começando com um ano hidrológico normal em 2003, até atingir a condição de seca extrema em 2005, resultando numa diminuição do fluxo fluvial. Ocasionalmente, foram observadas temperaturas anormais elevadas da água. Durante o ano de seca os recrutamentos de P. minutus foram pouco expressivos e a coorte parental desapareceu rapidamente, traduzindo-se num decréscimo da densidade e produção. Para P. microps este decréscimo não foi muito pronunciado. Não foi possível concluir um efeito directo das variações de salinidade e temperatura para os decréscimos observados. Contudo foi sugerida a hipótese do aumento de predação em P. minutus, dado que a maior incursão salina no estuário conduziu a um aumento de espécies de peixes marinhos adventícios piscívoros a jusante, onde P. minutus se distribui mais frequentemente. Pomatoschistus microps beneficiou de uma maior tolerância a variações na salinidade e temperatura, permitindo-lhe ocupar diferentes áreas no estuário, e desta forma pareceu melhor adaptado para lidar com as variações ambientais. Posteriormente foi desenvolvido um modelo ecológico para as mesmas espécies, com intuito de simular a dinâmica populacional (densidade e biomassa) de ambas. Para tal, foi utilizado como base, para obtenção dos parâmetros necessários ao modelo, o estudo de campo no período de três anos referido anteriormente. O modelo compreendeu duas fases/submodelos: 1) o de crescimento individual; e 2) dinâmica populacional (densidade) de juvenis e adultos. Estes sub-modelos foram agrupados para formarem o modelo de uma coorte (densidade e biomassa). As coortes foram então agrupadas e organizados de acordo com os recrutamentos de cada espécie, de forma a simular a população dos peixes em estudo. Os valores simulados pelo modelo foram concordantes com os valores reais de densidade e biomassa, obtidos no estudo de campo. Este procedimento permitiu igualmente constituir hipóteses no que respeita a possíveis condicionantes no desenvolvimento dos peixes em estudo, com particular relevância aos efeitos da seca extrema.A dieta de 14 espécies de peixe foi analisada no capítulo III. Entre as presas mais importantes constavam macroinvertebrados, nomeadamente vários poliquetas (Nephtys spp., Capitellidae, Spionidae e Eunicidae), Corophium spp. e Crangon crangon. Os peixes mais predados foram Pomatoschistus spp., e os copépodes calanoides as principais espécies presas de plâncton. Vários peixes demonstraram alguma tendência para uma dieta especializada. No entanto, quase todos demonstraram algum oportunismo alimentar, dado se alimentarem, ocasionalmente ou frequentemente, doutros recursos disponíveis no sistema. Foi observada uma elevada sobreposição alimentar entre algumas espécies de peixe, mas não foi possível concluir a existência de competição por recursos alimentares.Finalmente, no capítulo IV, a produção dos peixes residentes (P. minutus e P. microps) e dos peixes marinhos utilizando o estuário como viveiro (Dicentrarchus labrax, Platichthys flesus e Solea solea) foi avaliada, no período de Junho 2003 a Maio 2006. Estas espécies compreenderam cerca de 70% da comunidade ictiológica, no que respeita a densidade e biomassa. No geral, a produção do estuário do Mondego foi menor que noutros sistemas, sendo associada à área relativamente pequena do estuário. A produção decresceu no ano da seca, especialmente evidente para D. labrax, P. minutus e P. flesus. Não foi possível provar que estes efeitos se deviam às variações da temperatura e salinidade, e ao baixo fluxo fluvial (resultantes da seca e altas temperaturas). No entanto, estes constituíram a base para as hipóteses sugeridas para o decréscimo na produção: efeito directo, devido às tolerâncias de cada espécie e efeito indirecto através de um possível aumento da predação. Relativamente ao potencial de produção a ser exportado do estuário para zonas costeiras pelas espécies marinhas juvenis também se verificou uma diminuição durante as condições de seca.

T1  - The effect of temperature change on the New Zealand marine fish, Notolabrus celidotus
AN  - 2307054836
AB  - Physiological responses of the labrid fish Notolabrus celidotus to temperature change, found thermal compensation to be more advanced in cold environmental temperatures compared to warm environmental temperatures. N. celidotus was acclimated for 28 days to 8, 14 and 24 C and metabolism, ventilatory and circulatory function, condition factor, swimming ability, thermal tolerance and hypoxia tolerance investigated. N. celidotus acclimated to 8 C almost achieved full thermal compensation, which resulted in, resting and maximum oxygen consumption not being significantly different to 14 C acclimated fish. In contrast, N. celidotus acclimated to 24 C achieved only partial or no metabolic thermal compensation. This resulted in high resting oxygen consumption and a reduced aerobic scope for activity, which had detrimental affects on other physiological parameters investigated. Thermal compensation was achieved for the resting ventilation rate of the 8 C acclimated fish, which is most likely needed in order to meet the high oxygen demands incurred by metabolic thermal compensation. No thermal compensation was achieved for any other ventilation rate or for heart rate, at any acclimation temperature. Thermal compensation at the level of heart and ventilation rate of the 24 C acclimated fish, would have been limited by the lack of metabolic thermal compensation. A low condition factor of the 24 C acclimated fish would also have occurred due to the lack of metabolic thermal compensation, which would have caused high-energy demands and the utilization of energy stores. Thermal tolerance ranges shifted in the direction of temperature change for all acclimation groups, which indicates thermal compensation must have occurred to some degree at a variety of organizational levels. Swimming ability reflected metabolic thermal compensation, with the swimming ability of the 8 C acclimated fish being similar to the 14 C acclimated fish. In comparison, the 24 C acclimated fish had a diminished swimming ability, which is likely to have occurred due to the reduced aerobic scope for activity of these fish and the low condition factor. The findings suggest that the increasing temperatures associated with climate change will cause N. celidotus to migrate to cooler waters in order to survive. This response will have a large effect on New Zealand's marine ecosystem as N. celidotus is abundant in New Zealand waters and is an important part of the food chain. Additionally, the response of N. celidotus may be an indicator of the response of other New Zealand species to climate change, which could cause huge upset to New Zealand commercial fisheries.

T1  - Colonization and sucession of macrofauna in artificial substractes
AN  - 2008656756
AB  - Na colonização de um novo substrato por macroinvertebrados bentónicos, os colonizadores iniciais, maioritariamente provenientes de habitats adjacentes, podem estabelecer-se quer por meio de assentamento e recrutamento larvar, quer por dispersão de organismos adultos. Estes colonizadores respondem não só a propriedades físicas do substrato, reflectindo a sua capacidade e/ou necessidade de explorar novos recursos, mas também à presença de outros indivíduos, iniciando a cadeia de interacções bióticas que caracterizam a sucessão ecológica. O padrão temporal dos colonizadores iniciais pode determinar o decorrer da sucessão da comunidade não só pela ocorrência de fenómenos de inibição e facilitação, mas também pelo efeito da contínua chegada de novos colonizadores. Por conseguinte, a dinâmica inicial de sucessão é fortemente condicionada por flutuações das variáveis ambientais. No entanto, à medida que a sucessão avança, a instabilidade inicial vai paulatinamente dando lugar a uma situação de quasi-equilíbrio, na qual a dinâmica da comunidade passa a ser determinada por características dos ciclos de vida e por mecanismos de dominância das espécies que a compõem. A natureza dinâmica dos ecossistemas costeiros, como a Ria de Aveiro, dita a necessidade de estudar os processos de colonização e sucessão em condições ambientais muito específicas, de modo a poder determinar as tendências gerais de recuperação do ecossistema depois de uma perturbação, tanto ao nível das populações como ao nível das comunidades. Neste sentido, e com o objectivo de aprofundar o conhecimento dos mecanismos que regem ditos processos em comunidades macrobentónicas de substratos duro, o presente trabalho baseou-se numa série de experiências de campo com substratos artificiais (AS), levadas a cabo em dois pontos da Ria de Aveiro com condições hidrodinâmicas contrastantes. Num estudo preliminar de curta duração, réplicas de quatro tipos distintos de AS foram submergidas nos pontos experimentais e posteriormente recolhidos em três ocasiões durante um período de 6 semanas. Num estudo posterior de longa duração (14 meses), levou-se a cabo uma experiência de colonização em relva artificial, nos mesmo pontos experimentais. Obtiveram-se duas séries de amostras: 1) ‘Monthly’ em que réplicas submergidas num determinado mês, foram colhidas no mês seguinte, durante 14 meses; 2) ‘Start’ em que réplicas submergidas no início do período experimental, foram colhidas cada mês ao longo de 13 meses. Durante todo o período experimental, as principais variáveis ambientais foram monitorizadas mensalmente, através de medições efectuadas nos mesmos dias das amostragens, e sazonalmente através de medições efectuadas durante ciclos de 24 horas. A amostragem com substratos artificiais, revelou ser um método bastante efectivo na avaliação da diversidade de macrofauna bentónica infralitoral na Ria de Aveiro. Ao longo deste trabalho, foram colhidos um total de 440710 indivíduos pertencentes a 143 taxa. Observou-se uma grande assimetria na composição faunística dos dois pontos experimentais: a densidade máxima registada no ponto confinado foi de quase dois milhões de ind.m-2 , para um número máximo de taxa identificados de 31; no ponto exposto a densidade máxima não chegou a meio milhão de ind.m-2, mas foram identificados 110 taxa. De um modo geral, a estrutura das comunidades colonizadoras foi determinada pela acção negativa da complexidade dos AS, pelo efeito conjunto e a pequena-escala da heterogeneidade e variáveis ambientais, e pelo grau de confinamento dos pontos de amostragem. No ponto experimental mais exposto, os diferentes tipos de AS usados desenvolveram comunidades bentónicas muito diferentes e com dinâmicas de sucessão distintas, mas em todo o caso pouco abundantes, com elevada diversidade e altas taxas de renovação. No ponto mais confinado, todos os tipos de AS desenvolveram comunidades dominadas por populações extremamente densas de Corophium acherusicum, apresentando tendências semelhantes de sucessão e baixas taxas de renovação. Os mecanismos iniciais de sucessão mais relevantes, parecem ter sido conduzidos por fenómenos de inibição no ponto mais confinado e de tolerância no ponto mais exposto. O substrato que melhor desempenho mostrou durante o estudo preliminar foi a relva artificial. No estudo de longa-duração, as comunidades com um mês de idade mostraram uma componente sazonal muito marcada em ambos pontos experimentais, em resposta a flutuações sazonais da temperatura e salinidade da água, reflectindo por um lado a flutuação temporal da disponibilidade de indivíduos colonizadores e por outro, a ocorrência de relações interespecíficas pós-colonização. No entanto, as principais diferenças espaciais detectadas no estudo preliminar mantiveram-se nesta segunda fase. No ponto mais exposto as comunidades desenvolveram-se em dois passos: um period inicial de colonização nos primeiros 2-3 meses, seguido do período de sucessão conducente a uma estabilização da estrutura da comunidade. A dinâmica de colonização inicial foi determinada pela flutuação sazonal e competição interespecífica de cinco espécies de mobilidade reduzida e perfil essencialmente oportunista: C. acherusicum, C. acutum, Aora gracilis, Pomatoceros triqueter and Mytilus galloprovincialis. A actividade destes recrutas iniciais promoveu o posterior estabelecimento de espécies com preferências tróficas mais amplas. Este aumento da complexidade trófica foi acompanhado por uma estabilização do quociente colonização/emigração entre os três e os seis meses de colonização. As comunidades no equilíbrio foram condicionadas fundamentalmente por processos autogénicos, como a competição não-exclusiva. No ponto mais confinado, o padrão temporal das comunidades foi sobretudo determinado por alternâncias na dominância de três espécie altamente abundantes (C. acherusicum, Leptocheirus pilosus e Polydora sp.) provocadas por mecanismos de exclusão competitiva, despoletados por variações sazonais na disponibilidade de colonizadores e de fontes de alimento e protecção.    Alternate abstract:In the colonization of an open space by benthic invertebrates, early colonists, which are likely to be produced from the adjacent established community, may come either from larval settlement and recruitment or from adult dispersal. During settlement they respond not only to physical properties of the substrate, reflecting their ability and/or need to explore newly available resources, but also to the presence of concurrent establishers, triggering the complex net of biotic interactions of ecological succession. The temporal pattern of early colonization may dictate the progress of assemblage succession not only through intraassemblage post-colonization processes such as inhibition and facilitation, but also through the effect of the continuous arrival of colonists. Hence, in subtidal benthic assemblages, early successional dynamics is strongly dependent on patterns of environmental variability. Initial highly variable assemblages may though be gradually replaced by more stable ones, where life-history traits and dominance will be the major determinants of assemblage dynamics. The dynamic nature of coastal ecosystems, such as Ria de Aveiro, dictates the need to develop studies of colonization and succession under specific habitat conditions, in order to determine the general patterns of recovery following disturbance at community and population levels. As so, in order to understand the mechanisms behind those processes in hard-bottom macrofaunal communities of Ria de Aveiro, a set of experiments using artificial substrates (AS) were carried out at two sites with contrasting hydrodynamics. A short-term pilot experiment was conducted, where replicates of four types of AS were deployed at the experimental sites and sampled in three occasions over a period of six weeks. Afterwards, a long-term colonization experiment using artificial grass as AS was carried out at the experimental sites. Two series of samples were obtained: 1)’Monthly’ series –replicates deployed each month were collected in the following month, over a period of 14 months; 2)’Start’ series –replicates deployed at the beginning of the experiment were sampled each month over a period of 13 months. During the experimental period, the main environmental parameters were monitored through monthly records and seasonal 24 hour-cycles. The use of artificial substrates proved to be a very effective way to evaluate the diversity of hard-bottom assemblages in Ria de Aveiro. A total of 440710 individuals ascribed to 143 taxa were collected. There was an important site asymmetry in assemblage composition: the maximum density recorded in the confined site was about two million ind.m-2, while in the exposed site it did not reach the half-million ind.m-2; moreover, a maximum of 31 taxa were recorded in the confined site while 110 were recorded in the exposed site. Overall, the structure of the colonist assemblages was determined by the negative effect of AS complexity, the environment-dependent effect of smallscale substrate heterogeneity and by the general degree of confinement. of the sampling sites. In the exposed site, each AS type yielded distinct high diversity and low abundance assemblages, each of them with its particular successional dynamics, but always with high turnover rates. In the confined site, all AS yielded assemblages dominated by extremely dense populations of Corophium acherusicum and showed similar trends of successional dynamics marked by low turnover rates. The relevant early successional mechanisms identified seemed to be majorly driven by inhibition and tolerance in the confined and exposed site, respectively. During the pilot experiments, artificial grass showed the best performance as experimental AS. The long term-study allowed to develop a first approach in the explanation of the mechanisms behind colonization and succession of subtidal hardsubstrates, in Ria de Aveiro. At both sites the development of 1-month assemblages showed a strong seasonal component, associated with seasonal fluctuations in water temperature and salinity, which reflected the temporal fluctuation of colonist availability and short-term post-colonization interactions. However, the main site differences identified in the pilot experiments were confirmed to occur in the long-term experiment. In the exposed site the development of macrofaunal assemblages, occurred in two steps: an initial colonization and early succession period during the first 2-3 colonization months followed by the successional period of assemblage structure stabilization. Early colonists were majorly mobile amphipods, although shortterm post-colonization dynamics was determined by seasonal fluctuations and inter-specific competition of five low mobility species with an opportunistic profile: C. acherusicum, C. acutum, Aora gracilis, Pomatoceros triqueter and Mytilus galloprovincialis. The activity of these early settlers facilitated the further recruitment of species with a wider trophic preferences. The increase in the trophic complexity of the assemblages was accompanied by a stabilization of the ratio colonization/emigration, somewhere between the three to six months of colonization. The quasi-equilibrium assemblages were mainly ruled by autogenic processes, such as non-exclusive competition. In the confined site, the temporal pattern of the assemblages was primarily dictated by shifts in the dominance of three highly abundant taxa: C. acherusicum, Polydora spp. and Leptocheirus pilosus. These shifts were mostly the result of competitive exclusion, triggered by seasonal variations in the availability of both colonists and food/shelter resources. Hence, assemblages at this confined site seem to maintain a permanent “late colonization” or “early succession” stage, characterized by low trophic complexity.

T1  - Response to environmental stressors in native and invasive kelp species
AN  - 193719924
AB  - This study first characterized morphological variation in the California kelp, Egregia menziesii, over a large geographic scale. Marked differences in rachis and lateral morphology suggested local adaptation to variable conditions of wave exposure and upwelling. This was supported by observations indicating differential survivorship of smooth versus papillated individuals at sites with differing wave exposure. Sequencing of ITS regions did not reveal genetic structure among sampled populations providing little evidence for speciation in Egregia. To further investigate environmental responses, subsequent portions of this study characterized temperature tolerance in native and invasive kelp species. Since temperature is one of the primary factors determining seaweed distributions, investigations of how seaweeds cope with temperature may have particularly interesting implications relating to invasive species spread. Physiological mechanisms of thermotolerance (such as the heat shock response) may reveal the basis for local and regional patterns of distribution and abundance. I chose to examine up-regulation of the hsp70 gene to assess thermotolerance in the invasive kelp, Undaria pinnatifida, compared to California native kelps, Egregia menziesii and Pterygophora californica.  Individuals of all species were collected from 3 to 6 sites and three different habitats in California. Additionally, collections of  Undaria pinnatifida were made from two habitats in its native range in Japan. Using quantitative PCR, I found that the profile of hsp70  expression was more similar between like habitats than between closely related species or populations. I further observed that the invader exhibited a greater magnitude of response, which may result in greater thermotolerance and facilitate range expansion. Finally, since it is hypothesized that Hsp production varies with developmental stage, and U. pinnatifida gametophytes have been shown to have a broader temperature range for growth and survival than sporophytes, I examined up-regulation of hsp70 in gametophytes of invasive U. pinnatifida and quantified metabolic responses to temperature. Oxygen evolution measures and PAM fluorometry revealed that U. pinnatifida gametophytes remained metabolically active at temperatures well above normal environmental conditions, indicating they are broadly thermotolerant. However, they apparently employ some mechanism other than up-regulation of hsp70 transcription to cope with temperature effects as no gene induction was observed.

T1  - Identification of proteins associated with insect diapause and stress tolerance
AN  - 193666911
AB  - This dissertation focuses on patterns of protein synthesis that are linked to several different stress responses in insects. These include the overwintering dormancy response of insects, known as diapause; the response of insects to rapid drops in temperature, known as rapid cold hardening (RCH), and responses of an Antarctic insect to desiccation and rehydration.    Proteomics, the comprehensive study of all proteins in an organism, has proven to be a powerful technique for studying changes in protein abundance during various stresses. However, only a few studies have used proteomics to examine diapause and stress responses in insects. The primary focus of this work is to identify proteins associated with diapause, low temperature and desiccation. The flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis, and the midge, Belgica antarctica, were used as model organisms.    A proteomic analysis of pupal brains in S. crassipalpis revealed that heat shock proteins (Hsp) were among the most conspicuous brain proteins present in higher amounts during diapause. While the mRNAs encoding Hsps were previously known to be associated with diapause, other proteins identified during this study were not known to be linked to diapause, thus suggesting that the proteomic approach nicely supplements work done at the transcript level. A gene encoding neuropeptide like precursor 4 in  S. crassipalpis showed close association with diapause, suggesting a potential role for this gene in initiating and maintaining diapause. Changes in brain proteins following pupal diapause termination in S. crassipalpis  showed an increase in abundance of myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (Inos). The elevation of Inos at diapause termination is likely downstream of the physiological regulation that initiates development. During RCH, an increase in ATP synthase suggests that an elevation of ATP is an important component of this response, and a small Hsp increase suggests that at least one of the Hsps is actually mobilized during RCH, rather that after RCH as previously assumed. Proteomics of B. antarctica larvae indicate that both desiccation and rehydration elicit synthesis of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins that are likely to be involved in the body contraction and cytoskeleton rearrangements that are associated with survival of changes in body water content.

T1  - Foamed glass-ceramics prepared by using titania-bearing blast furnace slag
AN  - 1868457396
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorWith the gradual and further view of scientific development, developing circular economy and raising the availability of resources become a research hotpot in scientific research field recently. In this paper, foamed glass and foamed glass-ceramics were made by using titania-bearing blast furnace slags. Material was analyzed and characterized by modern test technique suchas XRD,SEM and FT-IR. The research not only has effect on resources,environment and ecoligy, but also finds utilization ways which can solve the utilization problem of titania-bearing blast furnace slag, improves technical content and adding value of Material. Foamed glass-ceramics which was prepared in the research is divided into two parts,that is, preparation of foamed glass and sitallization of foamed glass. In the first part, insulation materials of foamed glass were made by using titania-bearing blast furnace slag. Properties foamed glass were researched by the amount of additive and heat treatment. First, amount of additive and heat treatment process parameters were determined preliminarily by single factor experiment. Second the optimal amount of additive and optimum process parameters of heat treatment were obtained by the optimization of orthogonalization. The results show that the optimal content of blister calcium carbonate, stabilizing agent sodium phosphate and lacquer solvent borax were 1.5%,6% and 6% respectively. Heat treating regime foamed glass fired was the best when heating rate was 12℃/min,foaming temperature was 900℃ and foaming time was 15min.Excellent performance of foamed glass is homogeneous aperture, low thermal coefficient of conduction and low bulk density low by preheating,sintering, foaming,foam stabilizing and annealing and soon. The additions of blister, foaming time, and foaming temperature have great influence on aperture size and homogeneity of foamed glass. The additions of foam stabilizer limit generation of bulk to some extent. Production cost of foamed glass was decreased by using solid waste as basic material. In addition, due to smaller particle size of micro silicon powder, process in grinding of part raw omitted, thus material production cost was decreased to some extent. In the second part, foamed glass-ceramics as wall materials were made by using optimization of foamed glass with second heating treating. Microcrystallization behavior was controlled by controlling heat treatment. First, heat treatment process was preliminary ascertained using the single factor method. The best heat treatment processing parameters were obtained by using optimization treatment of orthogonalizatio. The results show that effect of nucleation temperature on microcrystallization behavior is the most influential factor. The second factor is crystallization temperature, and the third factor is nucleation time and crystallization time. Long nucleation time caused uneven crystallization while short nucleation time caused inadequacy of nucleation. Crystallization time mainly effect on Grain Size. Nucleation time and crystallization time are not suitable for long time, or they can produce harmful effects on microcrystallization behavior. The optimal processing parameters of heat treatment are showed as follows: nucleation temperature is 740 ℃, nucleation time is 80 min, crystallization temperature is 890 ℃, and crystallization time is 100 min. It produced a lot of nanocrystalline in the internal of foamed glass after heat treatment. By using modern test technique suchas XRD,SEM and FT-IR, main crystal phase of foamed glass-ceramics is hedenbergite, and anorthite was the minor crystallization phase, such as spherical magnesium titanate minor one e.g. Compressive strength of foamed glass significantly increased and thermal conductivity increased slightly to meet the standard of thermal insulation material for building wall. In a word, foamed glass has preferable heat-insulating propeily and simple technology by using titania-bearing blast furnace slag. When utilization ratio of titania-bearing blast furnace slag is over 30%,excellent properties of products were obtained with the lower sintering temperature and lower cost without the adding of nucleating agent.   Key words: Titania-bearing blast furnace slag; Foamed glass; Blister; Foamed glass-ceramics; Main crystal

T1  - Tolerance limits and survival potential of methanogenic archaea from Siberian permafrost under extreme living conditions.
TT  - Toleranzgrenzen und Ueberlebensstrategien von methanogenen Archaeen aus sibirischen Permafrosthabitaten unter Extrembedingungen
AN  - 20110367; 8351691
AB  - The characterizations of the survival potential of microorganisms which are able to thrive in extreme environments are receiving a great attention in astrobiological research as driven by the possibility of their existence in extraterrestrial extreme niches. Speculations about methanogenic life an Mars are arising since ESA mission Mars Express determined water an Mars, a fundamental requirement for life, as well as the presence of CH sub(4) in the Martian atmosphere, which could be originated only from active volcanism or from biological sources. In the view of these findings it became obvious that microbial life could still exist on Mars, for example in the form of subsurface lithoautotrophic ecosystems, which also exist in permafrost regions an Earth. The objectives of this study were to fill fundamental gaps in our knowledge about the physiological potential of methanogenic archaea and their tolerance limits to extreme environmental conditions in terrestrial or extraterrestrial permafrost. Within the scope of the DFG Priority Program "Mars and the Terrestrial Planets" the survival potential influenced by high salinity, extremely low temperatures, prolonged starvation and desiccation, ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, exposure to Oxygen as well as simulated Martian conditions were studied. For this purpose, the methanogenic archaea in pure cultures as well as in their natural environment of Siberian permafrost were used. The differences or similarities in the stress behavior of methanogens originated from permafrost and non-permafrost habitats under diverse stress conditions were compared. Generally, higher resistance to all stress factors tested was shown for the methanogenic archaea from Siberian permafrost in comparison to methanogens from non-permafrost habitats. A better adaptation to defined stress factors was observed at low incubation temperatures (4 degree C), which correlates well with the in situ temperatures of the active layer of permafrost. Furthermore, metabolic activity and viability of methanogenic archaea in environmental samples from permafrost remained unaffected by exposure to simulated Martian UV radiation due to the protected effect by soil particles. Moreover, irradiation of pure methanogenic cultures revealed unexpectedly high radiation resistance of permafrost strains to monochromatic, polychromatic and ionizing radiation. Until now, such a high resistance was only shown for Deinococcus radiodurans, the most radiation resistant bacterium an Earth. Finally, in simulation experiments, methanogenic archaea in pure cultures as well as in environmental samples from Siberian permafrost reveal a high survival potential under Martian diurnal thermo-physical conditions. Therefore, the investigation of the survival potential of these high specialized organisms provided a unique insight into possible life on the red planet.

T1  - The user centred design, development and evaluation of a practical heat stress risk assessment method
AN  - 898746699
AB  - A five stage systems life-cycle was adopted. Stage 1 involved a literature review and hierarchal tasks analysis of existing European and British heat stress standards. The literature review developed the rationale for the study by providing a knowledge framework on human thermal environments and human thermoregulation. This was supplement by a review of occupational heat stress. Stage 2 consisted of a series of ten experiments conducted at the Human Thermal Environments Laboratory at Loughborough University to compare the validity of ISO 7933 Required Sweat Rate (SWrcq) and Predicted Heat Strain (PHS) index predictions with observed physiological data. Comparisons were made between the predicted and observed sweat rates and the time it took core temperature to reach 38°C (Duration Limit Exposures). The results showed that neither the SWieq nor the modified SWreq model were valid predictors of Duration Limit Exposures (DLE) and predicted sweat rate for people wearing protective clothing in warm humid environments. The PHS DLE predictions were more representative of the ISO predictions than observed DLEs in all but one experiment. Although the PHS model predictions of sweat rate were an improvement on the ISO predictions, the model also significantly underestimated the observed sweat rates. Stage 3 provided the Exploratory Stage for the identification of appropriate ergonomic methods to collect the data necessary for the design, development and evaluation of a practical heat stress method for use in British Industry. A heuristic evaluation of the usability of ISO 7933 SWTreq was conducted. This found that the standard is unnecessarily scientific and may not encourage users to use it. The format and the information provided do not satisfy ergonomic guidelines of usability. The need for a more practical heat stress assessment methodology was identified. Stakeholder engagement through a practical field study of heat stress in a paper mill, together with informal interviews and discussion groups with potential users provided a framework for formulating the design, development of a prototype method. Stage 4 was the Design Stage. Expert discussion groups and the results of a postal questionnaire combined with the findings of Stage 3 provided for the user requirements and the functional specification of such a methodology to be established. This showed that a simple approach, together with additional information (e.g. expert systems, job aides etc) was required. A process flow diagram of heat stress risk assessment was developed as was a prototype Observation Checklist. In Stage 5 the Prototype Observation Checklist was evaluated in a comparative study with the Malchaire method (developed as part of the BIOMED II project). Although the Malchaire method was found to easier to use it did not meet the user's requirements. The outcome of Stage 5 was the development of a two part practical heat stress method. Both are based on simple checklists. Part A is concerned with identifying people who may be at added risk from working in the heat. Part B provides a checklist based on the six basic parameters of the human thermal environment; air and radiant temperature, humidity, air movement, clothing and metabolic rate. A score sheet is provided to allow users to identify factors of greatest risk. This forms part of a holistic approach to the Management, Assessment and Control (MA&C) of heat stress. Job aides such competency checklists, specimen record sheets and information for managers are also provided.

T1  - Cryogenic single and phased-array coils for Magnetic Resonance Imaging design and implementation.
AN  - 35334781; 200902-10-0012842 (CI); 200902-20-0008879 (EA)
AB  - Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) is now increasingly being used for fast imaging applications such as real-time cardiac imaging, functional brain imaging, and contrast enhanced MRI. Imaging speed and resolution in MRI are mainly limited by the signal to noise ratio (SNR). SNR can be improved by reducing the thermal noise in the system which can he achieved by cooling the coils and/or using high critical temperature superconductor (HTS) coils. The SNR can be further improved by optimizing the coil design, its associated electronics, and the interface used to connect to the system. Recently, there is a great demand for imaging using coil arrays. As the number of array elements increases and the size of each element continue to decrease, the thermal noise of the radio frequency (rf) receiver coil becomes the dominant source of system noise. In such a case, significant SNR improvement can be achieved by cooling down normal metal coil or by using HTS coils. The primary objective of this dissertation is to investigate the feasibility of reducing the thermal noise by using different designs of cryogenic, high SNR receiving coils and arrays for imaging of small animals. For imaging of small animals with high Q-factor coils both tuning the coils to the scanner's frequency and matching the coils to 50 Omega have to be controlled remotely from outside the scanner. The tuning/matching circuitry was designed and implemented using dc controlled variable capacitors (Varactors). For both single coils and coil arrays capacitive coupling to coils was a more convenient method to be implemented into the system. Capacitive decoupling was used to decouple array elements and was extensively investigated and tested. In this dissertation, different techniques for actively decoupling the receive coils from the volume transmit coil are also investigated. The development and fabrication of a 7 T cryogenic system for a receive-only single HTS coil for rat brain and spinal cord MRI is described and followed by a demonstration of the superiority of this coil over the state-of-art commercially available coils. The developed coils were extensively tested at the University of Texas Medical School using a Bruker T scanner. A 200% SNR gain over room temperature coils was recorded confirming that an HTS coil and array can provide very substantial SNR gains nor obtainable by other techniques of SNR improvement. The development and fabrication of a room temperature copper coil array are also presented and the resulting images are shown in this dissertation. The Sensitivity Encoding (SENSE) technique was chosen as an example for parallel imaging techniques. Software code was written in MATLAB to simulate and implement the SENSE technique on simulated and real images acquired with the coil array to obtain faster imaging.

T1  - Abdominal acoustic radiation force impulse imaging.
AN  - 33621485; 200905-16-0043130 (SO)
AB  - For many years, clinicians have been aware of the correlation between the mechanical properties of soft tissue and the tissue's state of health. This relationship has allowed for the technique of manual palpation to become an effective and simple mechanism for early detection of potential disease. However, the efficacy of manual palpation is generally limited to very superficial structures. Recently, several research groups have developed methods of elasticity imaging which seek to extend the depths over which the mechanical properties of soft tissues can be interrogated. The work presented in this thesis involves one of these elasticity imaging methods, called Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging. Initial developments of the ARFI imaging method focused upon applications requiring relatively superficial (3 cm or less) scanning depths. However, abdominal imaging applications in adults may require scanning depths of 10 cm or more. Challenges exist in adapting the ARFI method so that it can effectively displace and accurately monitor the dynamics of deep-lying tissues in a safe and clinically-relevant manner. In this thesis, we investigate the potential of ARFI imaging for use in abdominal applications. Results from feasibility and optimization experiments are provided. Finite element method (FEM) models of tissue heating and thermocouple measurements are utilized to determine the thermal safety of the abdominal ARM technique. FEM mechanical models are used in conjunction with a linear ultrasound simulation package to analyze limitations on abdominal ARFI imposed by physiological motion in target organs. The feasibility of radiofrequency (RF) ablation guidance with ARFI imaging is evaluated using an animal model and experiments with tissue-mimicking phantoms. Finally, an initial investigation into the clinical potential of abdominal ARFI imaging is performed through imaging sessions with cancer patients at the Duke University Medical Center. Results from both tissue-mimicking phantom and in vivo experiments indicate that ARFI imaging can successfully induce and track displacements in tissues at depths exceeding 9 cm. FEM and thermocouple measurements demonstrate the thermal safety of the abdominal ARFI technique at low frame rates and allow for safely-achievable frame rates to be determined for a number of imaging and tracking configurations. Although physiological motion may be prohibitive in some imaging scenarios, patient breath-hold and ECG-triggering allow for quality ARFI images to be acquired in most abdominal imaging situations. Thermal lesions induced with RF ablation methods are well-visualized with ARFI imaging in both an animal model and in follow-up assessments of human patients. Initial results demonstrate that both primary and secondary abdominal tumors appear with improved contrast in ARFI images relative to companion B-mode images. These studies provide preliminary evidence supporting the potential of abdominal ARFI imaging as a safe and viable clinical tool.

T1  - Using ecological physiology for the conservation and restoration of a declining species: A case study Sacramento perch (<i>Archoplites interruptus</i>)
AN  - 304901028
AB  - Although, California's only native sunfish, Sacramento perch, has been extirpated from its native habitat in the Sacramento-San Joaquin watershed, a lack of biological information has blocked development of restoration strategies. To address this gap, I investigated the physiological tolerances, performances and behavioral preferences of Sacramento perch to various environmental conditions. These results can be used to predict physiologically advantageous habitats for Sacramento perch and increase the efficacy of restoration efforts by elucidating differences between Sacramento perch and non-native species.    Laboratory-based experiments were conducted to address hypothesis surrounding this species' restoration efforts, compared to other centrarchids and field data from collection sites. Sacramento perch's hematological characteristics and hemoglobin-oxygen equilibria responses to temperature and carbon dioxide were assessed to understand its performances and environmental limits. At cool temperatures, Sacramento perch can tolerate hypoxic environments and sustain moderately high activity levels similar to native other California fishes; yet under warmer conditions they can tolerate only moderate hypoxia and sustain moderate activity levels. The optimal environmental conditions for Sacramento perch were described by defining their physiological tolerances, energetic costs, and environmental preferences over three life stages: larval, juveniles and adult. Although Sacramento perch have retained broad thermal tolerances, their metabolism and preferences indicate that this species is a "cool-water centrarchid" that can tolerate very harsh conditions (i.e., hypoxia, salinity and alkaline-pH). Because of altered water-flow regimes and diversions in California, I also considered Sacramento perch's ability to avoid entrainment. The critical swim performance (Ucrit) increased in the larval and juvenile stages with length, while the adults' Ucrit  decreased with increasing length, possibly due to preferential energy reallocation towards reproduction. In all stages, their Ucrit increased with temperature to 23°C, and then declined or reached a plateau at 26°C.    We conclude that Sacramento perch are cool-water fish that have retained many centrarchid physiological characteristics, yet are well adapted to historical California watersheds. Restoration for this species requires careful  site selection that provides floodplain access to larvae and juveniles, cool-water refuge for adults, and incorporates hydraulic refuges of ≤ 10, 20 and 30 cm/s for larvae, juveniles and adults, respectively.

T1  - Characterization of adiponectin in the canine
AN  - 304896716
AB  - Obesity is the most common nutritional disorder observed in small animal medicine. Obesity in dogs can result in numerous complications, including traumatic and degenerative orthopedic diseases, cardiopulmonary compromise, heat and exercise intolerance, pancreatitis, glucose intolerance, and diabetes mellitus. Adiponectin is a 30 kD hormone produced exclusively by adipocytes that was identified independently by four different groups in 1995. Serum concentrations of adiponectin are high in the normal state, accounting for approximately 0.01-0.03% of total plasma proteins. However, circulating concentrations of this hormone are significantly reduced in obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. Decreased adiponectin concentrations have been significantly correlated with the development of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is often associated with obesity and may be one of the links between increased adiposity and the development of type 2 diabetes. In dogs, the impact of compromised glucose tolerance and insulin resistance on health appears when dogs are even moderately overweight. The reduced capability to absorb glucose can hinder the ability of organs, tissues, and body systems to function properly, which can result in chronic health conditions. With increasing evidence that adiponectin may physiologically regulate energy metabolism and its importance in the relationship between obesity and the development of insulin resistance, adioponectin could potentially serve as a treatment target or marker for obesity, insulin resistance, and/or pre-diabetes. In order to determine the effects that insulin resistance has on adiponectin secretion and expression we have first characterized the secretion, circulating protein complex profile, and gene expression in normal dogs. Adiponectin is secreted into the serum as a >360 kD multimer, termed the HMW (high molecular weight) complex and as a 180 kD LMW (low molecular weight) complex. Under various reducing and denaturing conditions, adiponectin separates into cross-linked products whose molecular sizes are multiples of 30 kD. Additionally, gene expression of adiponectin is observed within visceral adipose tissue. We next studied adiponectin gene expression and protein secretion in dogs fed a high-fat diet in order to induce adiposity. High-fat fed dogs had a 2.6 fold increase in adiposity in the face of minimal weight gain (15.4%). High-fat fed dogs developed high/normal fasting insulin concentrations compared to controls at the peak of adiposity. Interestingly, adiponectin gene expression and secretion of total and high molecular weight adiponectin were unaffected at all timepoints during the course of this study.

T1  - The reform of energy subsidies for the enhancement of marine sustainability: An empirical analysis of energy subsidies worldwide and an in-depth case study of South Korea's energy subsidy policies
AN  - 304861033
AB  - This dissertation seeks to raise awareness about harmful effects of fossil fuel and nuclear energy subsidies that have blocked transition from conventional energy to a decarbonized, renewable energy system. Today, humans face daunting challenges in the form of global warming, which results mainly from the burning of fossil fuels. To avoid catastrophe, the transition to a renewable energy regime should be an urgent priority; however, the reality is that the progress of renewable energy is very slow due to the various political and economic factors when compared to conventional energy resources. A chief factor is that the energy subsidy for fossil fuel and nuclear energy obstructs the "level playing field" for renewable energy. Energy subsidies for conventional energy can be understood in the context of the commodification paradigm, which regards nature as an object of conquest and supports the principle of more is better. Although fossil fuel energy damages the environment, economy, and social equity, all countries subsidize such energy, no matter the country's state of development. This holds true as much in the U.S. and the EU as in China, India and South Korea.    The oceans, which cover 71% of the earth, are threatened by the activities of conventional energy, which are underpinned by subsidies. These subsidies have contributed to the destruction of the marine ecosystem through increased GHG emissions like CO2 and NOx which cause a sea temperature increase and coral bleaching. Subsidies also significantly affect fishery overexploitation, oil pollution, and thermal pollution. In-depth empirical analysis of South Korea showed how fossil fuel and nuclear energy activities have threatened marine sustainability through thermal pollution, algae bloom (red tides), overexploitation, and oil-related marine pollution. Reforming subsidies of fossil fuel and nuclear energy should be a global priority because of imminent of global warming.    As strategies for energy subsidy reforms, first of all, humans need a new energy paradigm to replace the hitherto dominant commodification paradigm. On an international level, creation of an international renewable energy agency and creation of renewable funds will spur on energy subsidy reforms of all nations, especially developing countries. On a national level, government's role should change from growth-oriented economic policy to sustainable development that includes environmentally friendly energy systems. In terms of social welfare, energy subsidies should be transformed to direct income policy, which is more effective for the welfare of the poor. The South Korean government should exchange its current supply-oriented fishery policy, which relies heavily on energy subsidies, to a Marine Reserves policy and direct income policy.    For successful energy subsidy reforms, the government, NGOs, and private market should cooperate. Specifically, NGOs' role in monitoring and pushing government's energy subsidy reform is invaluable, considering the limits of modern bureaucracy and the profit-oriented market character. Most environmental problems, including global warming, have a close relation with fossil fuel and nuclear energy use. Historically, these energy systems have become entrenched deeply in society through energy subsidy policy. Energy subsidy reforms are a key to the environmental problem and accelerated transition to renewable energy.

T1  - Factors affecting piping plover (Charadrius melodus) parental care behavior and hatching success on Long Island, New York
AN  - 304852067
AB  - An important and well-known stage of avian parental care is egg incubation. This demanding task requires the formation of a physiological unit with suitable thermal, gaseous, and hydric conditions that balances the needs of developing offspring and the energetic demands of adults.  Parent birds also need to successfully defend their nesting territory against con-specifics and protect their eggs from predators. Birds exhibit a wide variety of nest defense behaviors that usually involve leaving eggs unattended to deter predators, while mediating the risk of self survival and future reproductive success.  The benefits of parental care, however, do outweigh the costs. This is substantiated by the fact that most birds exhibit bi-parental incubation and that hatchability (the average proportion of eggs hatching excluding nests that are not depredated, abandoned, or otherwise destroyed) in many avian populations is approximately 91%. Understanding the factors that affect hatching success is crucial for protecting species that have been presented with novel anthropogenic disturbances that limit and degrade nesting habitat.    The focal species chosen for this study, the Atlantic Piping Plover ( Charadrius melodus), is listed as federally threatened and New York State endangered and has not yet recovered from serious declines during the 20th century. The primary goals of my research were to evaluate the fertility and development of Piping Plover eggs from completely failed and mixed-fate nests (nests where not all eggs successfully hatch) from multiple sites from across Long Island (Chapter I, Appendix A), examine patterns of predator/human disturbance associated with low plover hatching success (defined as the total number of eggs that hatch divided by the total number of eggs laid) at Suffolk County Parks sites (Chapter I), and investigate the relationship between disturbance, parental care behavior, and hatching success (Chapter II). I found that Piping Plovers on Long Island (including Suffolk County Parks) abandoned fertilized, viable eggs and that unhatched eggs from mixed-fate nests were more likely to be unfertilized or poorly developed compared to eggs from abandoned nests. This was the first study to examine and report Piping Plover embryo development and eggshell morphology. Furthermore, I calculated overall plover egg hatchability for Suffolk County Parks sites, a statistic that can be used to quantify why eggs do not hatch in plover populations (due to reasons other than predation, abandonment, and wash-out events, more likely due to infertility or poor embryonic development). This is significant because analyzing only hatch rates may allow land managers and biologists to overlook declines in hatchability; a potential sign of decreasing genetic variability and/or contaminant exposure.    Nesting Piping Plovers at Suffolk County Parks sites were exposed to a variety of threats in addition to nest destruction by predators or high tides. Hatching success (0.60 eggs hatch for each egg laid) was lower than historical reports for the region (0.91 eggs hatch for each egg laid). Hatchability however, was not lower than the baseline percentage reported for birds (91% of eggs hatch out of the eggs that are laid and are not destroyed). In other words, the frequency of mixed-fate nests (nests where at least one, but not all eggs hatch; i.e. partial clutch failure) was probably not a factor limiting hatching success in this population. On the contrary, mammalian predators, especially Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes), were a primary factor responsible for nest abandonment where foxes were active and paced around nest exclosures. Completely failed plover nests had higher numbers of fox tracks near them prior to abandonment.    Piping Plovers were persistent incubators (92% attendance), and their behavior does seem to be affected by human and predator disturbance. Plovers left their nests and switched incubation duties less frequently during weekends when humans were most active, and were also more attentive at night when mammalian predators were most active. Diurnal disturbance (avian, dog, and human) and incubation behavior did not appear to affect hatching success at Suffolk County Parks which may indicate that symbolic fencing provided an adequate buffer for nesting plovers. Nocturnal disturbance from mammalian predators, which presents a high-risk to adult survival, resulted in a rapid cessation of parental care activities. While patterns of nest attendance (behavior) could not be used to predict abandonment events, it is probable that birds exposed to high levels of predator disturbance became stressed, resulting in a physiological response (i.e. elevated heart rate, altered hormone-plasma levels) and temporary reproductive abandonment.  Modified nest exclosures that prevent predators from pacing directly around nests or changes in exclosure assignment criteria could help to reduce disturbance from introduced mammalian predators and increase plover hatching success. In addition, conservation biologists interested in studying the effects of disturbance on declining species should consider investigating physiological responses to complement their behavioral observations.

T1  - Phenology and taxonomic composition of lotic Chironomidae (Diptera) communities in contrasting thermal regimes
AN  - 304839778
AB  - Temperature is generally assumed to be the most important factor influencing aquatic insects. However, for most aquatic insect species sufficient information is not available to predict how temperature affects their life history and distribution. To improve the understanding of this relationship, the influence of temperature on the phenology, composition, and community dynamics of chironomid communities in Minnesota streams was performed followed by a detailed study on a common winter-emerging species,  Diamesa mendotae Muttkowski. The phenology and composition of chironomid communities was measured using biweekly collections of surface floating pupal exuviae from six thermally stable and six thermally variable streams in east-central Minnesota. The results of this assessment indicate that chironomid taxa richness is significantly influenced by thermal variability with thermally variable streams in this region supporting many more taxa. This pattern was driven by the high summer temperatures in thermally variable streams which support a diverse fauna of warm-adapted taxa (i.e., Chironominae and Tanypodinae) that were largely excluded from more thermally stable streams. Differences in thermal preferences among congeneric taxa did not appear to increase temporal partitioning of the habitat to permit a greater number of species to coexist. These patterns indicated that temporal shifts in the community were therefore largely manifest at the subfamily or tribe level. Autecology research on  D. mendotae indicated that this species is well adapted to winter activity, with a supercooling point in the adults of -21.5°C and freeze tolerance in the larvae. Life history studies indicate that the growth of this species is largely limited to habitats with temperatures below 10°C. In thermally buffered streams, this species was bivoltine or multivoltine with the bulk of larval development occurring during winter. Both community-level and species-level research provides a better understanding of how temperature regulates chironomid species and communities in small streams of the upper Midwest. This knowledge is important if these aquatic communities are to be used more effectively in biological monitoring and will improve predictions of the impacts of climate change on aquatic species and communities.

T1  - Impacts of changing water temperatures on the life histories of two invasive ascidians in the Gulf of Maine: <i>Botryllus schlosseri</i> and <i>Botrylloides violaceus</i>
AN  - 304838041
AB  - The impact of temperature on organism life cycles has received great attention due to heightened awareness of global warming. Relative growth and reproductive development were monitored in two dominant ascidians from the Gulf of Maine to compare effects of rising temperatures on established ( Botryllus schlosseri) versus recently arrived (Botrylloides violaceus) species. Settlement panels were deployed at three sites with different temperature regimes (Damariscotta, ME, Newcastle, NH, and Salem, MA) during two growing seasons June 2005 to December 2006, and a recruitment study conducted May to December 2006. Both species had elongated breeding seasons in Salem, MA relative to the other sites. Botryllus schlosseri  settled two weeks earlier than Botrylloides violaceus at all sites, however this delay in settlement can be attributed to the longer brooding period of Botrylloides violaceus. Timing of initial settlement may not be as indicative of temperature tolerances as timing of initial egg production in brooding animals.

T1  - Exploring the cellular mechanisms of cnidarian bleaching in the sea anemone <i>Aiptasia pallida</i>
AN  - 304835289
AB  - Many members of the Phylum Cnidaria are mutualistic with unicellular dinoflagellates belonging to the genus Symbiodinium. Corals are the most widely recognized example of these associations due to their key ecological importance in coral reef ecosystems where they serve as the structural and trophic foundation of these rich ecosystems. Coral reefs are severely threatened by human activities worldwide and are at great risk from global climate change, in particular the increase in seasurface temperatures. Detailed knowledge of how corals respond to stress is scarce. The most serious and immediate response of corals to environmental stress is a process referred to as coral bleaching (a.k.a. cnidarian bleaching). Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular processes by which elevated temperatures elicit the bleaching response are poorly understood. This dissertation deals with this important question by describing two mediators of cnidarian bleaching in the model symbiotic tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pallida (Verril), namely nitric oxide and cyclophilin.    After an introduction to the topic of cnidarian-algal symbioses and cnidarian bleaching (Chapter 1), I present results from a study describing the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in the anemone A. pallida (Chapter 2). Elevated temperature as well as oxidative stress induces production of NO and exposure of A. pallida to NO induces bleaching at non-stressful temperatures. Co-incubation with an NO scavenger suppresses bleaching. I propose that the host up-regulates NO production in response to elevated oxidative stress and that this situation leads to cytotoxicity and bleaching.    Chapter 3 examines the role of cyclophilin from A. pallida in the regulation of the symbiosis. Cyclophilins belong to a highly conserved family peptydyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases). Incubation of A. pallida with cyclosporin A (CsA), a potent inhibitor of cyclophilin resulted in bleaching and a decrease in tolerance to elevated temperatures. Protein extracts from A. pallida exhibited CsA-sensitive PPIase activity. Laser scanning confocal microscopy using superoxide and nitric oxide-sensitive fluorescent dyes on live A. pallida revealed that CsA strongly induced the production reactive oxygen species as well as NO. We tested weather the CsAsensitive isomerase activity is important for maintaining the activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). SOD activity of protein extracts was not affected by pre-incubation with CsA in vitro. In Chapter 4 I review what is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of bleaching and describe a model of bleaching based on the results presented herein as well as studies of non-cnidarian models.

T1  - The ecology of developmental timing in a neotropical turtle, <i>Kinosternon leucostomum</i>
AN  - 304832357
AB  - I studied how the expression, timing, and duration of embryonic diapause (ED), morphogenesis, and embryonic aestivation (EA) relate to variation in environmental conditions experienced by turtle embryos. ED and EA are putative mechanisms that increase embryonic survivorship. ED arrests development before main morphogenesis and is induced before the onset of adverse environmental conditions. EA prolongs incubation by depressing the metabolism of the embryo after completion of morphogenesis. I tested two hypotheses with regard to the environmental conditions that stimulate ED and EA based on climatic patterns. My first hypothesis suggested a single suitable developmental period (SDT; periods when soil moisture and temperature of nesting substrate are within the physiological tolerances of developing embryos) during the dry seasons, and my second hypothesis predicted two SDTs at the transition from the rainy and dry seasons. Incubation experiments using white-lipped mud turtle,  Kinosternon leucostomum, embryos confirmed that temperature is an important factor in determining the duration of both ED and morphogenesis, and that morphogenesis occurs during the dry season SDT.    Female size generally correlates positively with egg and offspring size. However, when embryos experience prolonged incubation periods, females may alter their reproductive investment strategies to offset potential additional embryonic energy expenditures. When accounting for female size, larger clutches had eggs with greater mass than smaller clutches; and egg size increased with female size. Thus in K. leucostomum the typical relationship between egg size and clutch size as it pertains to division of maternal resources per propagule is weakened by the embryo's ability to arrest development during extended incubation periods.    Nearly 50% of all turtle taxa are undocumented as to the expression of ED. I used categorical data modeling to create probabilities for predicting ED expression. Results indicate that greater than one-half of the undocumented species have a high probability of expressing ED. Conservation projects that alter incubation conditions of eggs may alter life history patterns and create unforeseen implications for population viability. Thus, it is critical for biologists performing ex-situ chelonian conservation projects with species which posses prolonged incubation periods to understand the role of ED and EA has in chelonian developmental ecology.

T1  - The thermal ecology of the Red-spotted toad, <i>Bufo punctatus, </i> across life history
AN  - 304755119
AB  - Compared with other terrestrial vertebrates, amphibians are generally less tolerant of thermal extremes. The Mojave Desert has ambient temperatures outside the proposed thermal tolerance zone of its mort abundant amphibian, the Red-spotted toad (Bufo (Anaxyrus) punctatus). Few data have been presented regarding the thermal ecology of these animals, including their thermal histories and proposed strategies to avoid temperature extremes. Previous studies suggest B. punctatus avoids extreme thermal exposure and adult toads experience body temperature (Tb) below a proposed critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of 35°C, and can maintain Tb at 25°C during the winter. Further, previous studies indicate a CTmax for tadpoles of 33°C. A reassessment of the thermal ecology of Red-spotted toads was warranted based on personal observations reported in this thesis.    I recorded environmental and/or Tb of Red-spotted toads across their entire life history: eggs, tadpoles, juveniles and adults. In the field, eggs and tadpoles may encounter water temperatures as high as ~40°C. Juveniles can experience Tb as high as 42.2°C. Adult toads experience Tb as high as 39.1°C. These observations were combined with experimental determination of CTmax across life history statges: the CTmax of tadpoles was variable, but decreased as development progressed; adult toads exhibit a CTmax as high as 45.2 ± 1.0°C. I documented thermal preferences (Tp) of tadpoles and adults. In contrast to other studies of the effect of ontogeny on preferred temperature, Tp, of Red-spotted toads remains fairly constant across development. I documented developmental time from egg deposition to metamorphosis at 18 days in the summer and 47 days in the spring—both periods are less than the previously described 60-day developmental period. Finally, I present preliminary data on apparent basking-like behavior of late stage tadpoles in the field.    Despite seemingly high and presumably stressful environmental temperatures, Red-spotted toads do not generally live on the verge of thermal tolerance. However, later stage tadpoles may encounter potentially lethal temperatures. The collected data document the thermal ecology of Red-spotted toads and contradict previously assumed limits that may not have been experimentally-derived. These data may allow informed decision making in land use and conservation efforts by better defining an important ecological parameter in a species that may be subjected to increased pressures by human activity and climatic change.

T1  - Thermal acclimation and adaptation in the common killifish, <i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>: Thermal reaction norms and underlying mechanisms
AN  - 304707118
AB  - I have quantified the effects of temperature on the performance of killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) from the northern and southern ends of the species' distribution along the East coast of North America, and examined potential mechanisms that could be involved in shaping these traits. I demonstrated that upper and lower thermal tolerance limits were higher in southern fish by ∼1.5°C, consistent with adaptation to warmer habitat temperatures (Chapter Two). Thermal tolerance limits were, however, plastic in both populations, changing by >10°C with temperature acclimation. In thermal preference experiments, the thermally tolerant southern killifish chose lower temperatures than the less tolerant northern fish (29.0°C versus 30.6°C; Chapter Three), consistent with countergradient variation. Swimming performance (U crit) trials on thermally acclimated and acutely challenged killifish revealed a broad zone (∼7-34°C) over which performance varied little with temperature in both populations (Chapter Four). Taken together, these data showed that although there were differences in thermal tolerance limits between populations, there was little evidence of local thermal adaptation in other measured traits.    As a candidate mechanism underlying differences in thermal tolerance, I examined the role of heat shock proteins (lisps) and found significant differences between populations in hsp mRNA expression and across multiple isoforms (Chapter Two), but these differences were not obviously consistent with the thermal tolerance differences between killifish populations. I also explored the adjustment of aerobic capacity at the level of the mitochondria (Chapter Five) as a potential mechanism defining an organism's thermal niche, as proposed in the hypothesis of oxygen limited thermal tolerance. In response to cold acclimation, both killifish populations increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity and content, with northern fish increasing both to a greater degree. With warm acclimation, however, killifish mitochondrial function and content were very similar between populations. These data suggest the possibility of evolutionary modulation at the level of the mitochondria to enhance aerobic performance in the cold.    Overall, I have shown that there are differences between northern and southern killifish at the physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels. These data highlight the importance of considering multiple mechanisms that could underlie differences in whole-organism performance when investigating local thermal adaptation.

T1  - The limits of osmoregulation: Strategies for tolerance and acclimation of ‘California’ Mozambique tilapia (<i>Oreochromis mossambicus</i> x <i>O. urolepis hormorum</i>) to conditions of the Salton Sea
AN  - 304706517
AB  - The Salton Sea is a large inland lake in southeastern California with salinity currently near 44 g/l that is increasing at a rate of 0.3 g/l annually. Along with salinity, large fluctuations in temperature and dissolved oxygen levels combine to make a very challenging environment that may be responsible for dramatic losses to the Salton Sea's once robust fishery. The dominant species within the fishery is a Mozambique tilapia hybrid (Oreochromis mossambicus x O. urolepis hornorum), which is well known both for euryhalinity and tolerance of extremely high salinities; as such, it provides a unique model for tolerance to hypersaline conditions as well as the interactions of multiple stressors such as those within the Salton Sea. In part one I describe two responses by tilapia to salinities greater than seawater at 25°C. When transfers were conducted below 60 g/l salinity, tilapia maintained osmotic balance without increasing drinking rate, mitochondrial-rich cell (MRC) turnover, or branchial Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) activity. With additional increase above 60 g/l, these variables increased in similar fashion to that which has been described in other teleosts during acclimation to elevated salinity. These acclimation responses were defined as response I or response II, with a transition point between the two at 60 g/l. Tilapia exhibiting response I had a reduced whole animal oxygen consumption rate, as well as, liver and brain ATPase activity in proportion to salinity. In part two, I describe how changes in temperature affect the salinity tolerance of this species. Variation in temperature from 25°C to 15 or 35°C resulted in increased plasma osmolality and/or mortality, indicating a combined temperature/salinity stress is more challenging than salinity alone. Using tissue microarrays and laser scanning microscopy, I show that tilapia attempted to respond to the loss of osmotic balance in cold temperatures with MRC hypertrophy and enhanced NKA capacity.    Keywords. Osmoregulation, ion regulation, tilapia,  Oreochromis mossambicus, Salton Sea, hypersalinity, tissue microarray, osmorespiratory compromise.

T1  - Micro and macroclimate effects on reproductive performance of common eiders
AN  - 301684716
AB  - The physical environment has a strong influence on the lives or organisms by limiting the way energy is gained and expended determining the capacity of organisms to invest in activities like reproduction. The avian nest site and structure, through its effects on the thermal conditions of the proximal environment of the incubating parent can affect several aspects of an individual’s reproductive success. On a larger scale, characteristics of the oviposition site can impact the spatial distribution of a species and consequently several aspects of population dynamics. In this thesis I investigate the importance of the thermal environment and nesting habitat on the reproductive performance of a sea duck, the Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) breeding in a cold environment. First I described the spatial variation in nest distribution in relation to female’s and nest attributes. Females of similar quality formed aggregations of nests and clusters of high productivity were occupied earlier in the season and at higher densities. Eiders seemed to choose to nest sites based on biotic (conspecifics) rather than abiotic (microclimate) cues. By providing females with artificial shelters I tested some of the effects of microclimate on individual physiology and use of energy during incubation. Females experienced improved microclimatic conditions provided by well-sheltered nest-sites. Nest shelter conferred advantages both to incubating females by allowing energy savings and to their clutches by providing more stable incubation conditions. Shelter did not have an appreciable effect on the female’s stress response. However, in exposed areas, females with high levels of corticosterone hatched a lower proportion of eggs than females with low corticosterone. Behavioural and functional aspects nest construction were tested first, by removing down from nests on repeated occasions throughout incubation and then by testing the effects of different amounts of down on the microclimate of incubation. Females did not replace the removed down suggesting the existence of constrains on the allocation of down to the nest. Large amounts of down in the nest contributed to more stable incubation conditions but females were able to counterbalance poor nest insulation and keep incubation temperature constant but the costs of doing this are unclear. Finally, I assessed the influence of environmental variability on the onset of incubation and short-term fluctuations in population size for the study colony with data from 1977 to 2006. I found that after mild winters female Eiders lay earlier in the season perhaps because milder conditions allow them to attain the necessary body condition for reproduction sooner. Summer temperature had a lagged effect (2 yr) on colony size that could be related to the delayed maturity (age at first reproduction) presented by Common Eiders and the influence of climate on influence recruitment rate to the population. The evidence presented here shows that Common Eiders are strongly influenced by their thermal environment on reproduction but by choosing a good nest they can ameliorate those effects. However nest site selection seems to be strongly linked to female quality rather than to nest properties.

T1  - Metabolism and physiology during ontogeny of cultured yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi Carangidae)
AN  - 2283207137
AB  - Various aspects of metabolism and physiology were investigated during the ontogeny of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi), a fish of growing aquaculture importance in both New Zealand and other countries. Incubation experiments between 18-24 C showed that developing eggs and larvae were heavily influenced by temperature. It appeared that at warmer temperatures larvae hatched smaller but grew on the yolk sac, whereas at cooler temperatures larvae grew inside the chorion. Oxygen consumption data supported this, with a negative correlation found between total embryonic oxygen consumption and temperature. A mechanism was proposed to explain the differential effect of temperature on ontogeny and growth. Like other marine fish with pelagic eggs, yellowtail kingfish were found to be heavily reliant on free amino acids as a source of energy. At 23 C the pattern of substrate utilisation in eggs was considerably different from that at 17-21 C, indicating that 23 C exceeded the tolerance for normal development. Inter-individual aggression by large individuals was associated with the development of size heterogeneity in juveniles. Although this aggression also affected the survival of smaller juveniles, it was not the primary agent of much of the mortality that occurs during this phase, as many of these individuals were on a degenerate developmental trajectory. Yellowtail kingfish fingerlings used for ongrowing were robust to the stressors imposed by live transport. The ontogenetic development of metabolic rate from 0.6 mg-2.2 kg did not follow the same scaling exponent as that observed for mammalian models of allometry, and has implications for interspecific studies of mass-dependent metabolism.

AN  - 1894977681
AB  - In this thesis the evolutionary relationships of the inshore fish fauna of the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean were assessed. Twelve coastal fish species from six families: Blenniidae, Labridae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Sparidae and Tripterygiidae, were studied using mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers. Results were analyzed applying phylogeographic and histórical demography approaches.    This study contributes to further our knowledge on the evolutionary relationships of the coastal fauna of the Atlantic-Mediterranean, pointing out that features like thermal tolerances and dispersal ability of the species are amongst the important forces shaping the phylogeographic patterns of the species. -   Nesta tese são analisadas as relações evolutivas da fauna piscícola costeira do Atlântico nordeste e do Mediterrâneo. Foram estudadas doze espécies de peixes costeiros pertencentes a seis famílias: Bienníidae, Labridae, Pomacentridae, Scaridae, Sparidae e Tripterygiidae, utilizando marcadores moleculares mitocondriais e nucleares. Os resultados foram analisados através de métodos filogeográficos e de demografia histórica.    Dentro do Mediterrâneo, Thalassoma pavo e Chromis chromis revelaram a existência de restrição ao fluxo genético a sul da Peloponésia grega, onde um gyre anticiclónico foi identificado.    Este estudo contribui para alargar o nosso conhecimento acerca das relações evolutivas da fauna costeira do Atlântico-Mediterrâneo, e aponta características como a tolerância térmica e capacidade de dispersão das espécies, como forças importantes para o delinear de padrões filogeográficos das espécies.

T1  - Design options analysis for a zero energy block of flats in Athens, Greece
AN  - 1430534987
AB  - Human activities and to a smaller degree other reasons have led to climate change. This is evident in meteorological phenomena and natural procedures which are constantly subject to modifications. Recent studies prove that a great percentage of the CO2 emissions, which are partly responsible for the climate change, are produced by buildings. In fact, a big part of them belongs to the residential sector. Countries like UK are quite aware of this problem, its causes, its consequences, as well as of some remedies that can at least limit the damage. Therefore, they develop the appropriate legislation, in an effort to decrease the problems and limit its causes. Greece, on the other hand, has been quite ineffective until now. Hopefully the new legislation will constrain the causes of the problem, in all sectors, including the building domain. This study involves designing a zero energy block of flats in Athens, with climatic data and environmental parameters taken into consideration from the initial steps of the design procedure. Appropriate software has been used in order to observe the improvement of thermal comfort conditions by changing the building design and using various strategies for passive cooling and heating. The predicted consumption of electricity, heating and cooling loads have been calculated and renewable sources of energy have been used in order to meet those needs. The economical analysis demonstrated that this type of building, is not only energy efficient and thermally comfortable for its occupants, but also economically profitable, especially with regard to the benefit of the occupants and the environment. In fact, it is only 11.2% more expensive to construct such a building, while its energy performance reduces the amount of CO2 emissions. The aim is to widely implement this type of buildings, which can have a significant effect on environmental, economical and social development related issues.

ABSTRACT

Background
It is well known that premenopausal women have lower incidence of coronary heart disease than age-matched men. This significant gender difference has been attributed at least in part to negative effects of testosterone on the cardiovascular system. Endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) have been used by athletes to improve performance by increasing muscle mass and strength. Among the numerous documented toxic and hormonal effects of AAS, attention has been recently focused especially on the cardiovascular effects. 
It is reported that there are increases in blood pressure and peripheral arterial resistance, and there are also effects on the heart muscle, primarily left ventricular hypertrophy with restricted diastolic function. Severe cardiac complications (heart failure, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular thromboses, myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death) in individual strength athletes with acute AAS abuse have also been reported. However, AAS consist of a variety of different steroids with differing pharmacological properties. No clinical study has yet demonstrated a conclusive link between physiological testosterone and fatal cardiovascular events. Epidemiological data and an intervention study rather suggest either a neutral or a beneficial effect of natural circulating androgens on coronary heart disease in men. Testosterone replacement in orchidectomized rats improved the recovery of myocardial function after ischemia/reperfusion injury. These processes involve changes in gene-expression controlled by intracellular androgen receptor mediated pathways. 
Recent studies have, however, demonstrated alternative, rapid intracellular androgen receptor-independent mode of testosterone action. For example, administration of testosterone acutely induces vasodilatation in the systemic, coronary, and pulmonary vascular beds. Acting in this way, testosterone might increase myocardial tolerance to ischemia. Er et al. have recently shown that testosterone is directly cytoprotective in the myocardium, through activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the mitochondrial inner membrane. It has been proposed that these rapid androgen actions may be exerted through membrane receptors that stimulate early intracellular signaling pathways through interaction with G proteins. Jose Miguel Vicencio found that in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes, testosterone increases intracellular Ca2+ levels by a non-genomic mechanism, which involves a membrane androgen receptor, a PTX sensitive G protein, PLC, IP3 and IP3R as signaling pathway. Androgens act acutely to stimulate contractility of cardiac myocytes independent of other factors which can influence myocyte function in vivo.
In this study, we examined the chronic and acute effect of testosterone treatment on rat myocardium. Furthermore, we hypothesize that testosterone exert its acute cardioprotective effects by a mitochondrial pathway, specifically via inhibition of mPTP opening. Also we tested the role of mPTP modulators in the effect of testosterone.

Objectives
   The aim of the present study was to investigate the chronic and acute effect of androgen replacement therapy on rat hearts against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Eight weeks after gonadectomy, all the heart were mounted on a Langendorff apparatus to assess contractile function. In the isolated myocytes model, cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion and cell contraction were observed using vedio tracking system. We hypothesize that mitochondrial channel or pores are involved in the mechanisms of acute cardioprotective effect of testosterone.

Methods
1.	Gonadectomy model and hormonal replacement therapy
    For the gonadectomized (GDX) group, the cauda epididymidis, caput epididymidis, vas deferens, and testis were extracted. The vas deferens were ligated bilaterally and the testes removed. The vas deferens were reinserted into the scrotal sac and underlying membrane. The replacement regimen of testosterone propionate (TP) to TP group and vehicle to GDX group was begun 1 week after gonadectomy, in order to provide sufficient period to clear the endogenous steroids.
2.	Isolated Perfused Heart Preparation
After 8 weeks all the rats were anesthetized and the hearts were excised rapidly, placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer, mounted on a Langendorff apparatus. In the present study, the isolated heart was subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion, which induced myocardial injury. 
3.	Lactate dehydrogenase measurement
To assess the extent of myocardial tissue injury, the effluent from the isolated perfused heart was collected at 5 min of reperfusion and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was spectrophotometrically assayed. LDH activity was expressed as units per liter.
4.	Measurement of the Area of Risk
For determination of infarct size, the coronary artery was reoccluded at the end of reperfusion, and a solution with 2.5% Evans blue was perfused. Hearts were then frozen and cut into slices, which were then incubated in a sodium phosphate buffer containing 1% (w/v) 2, 3, 5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride for 15 min to visualize the unstained infarcted region. Infarct and risk zone areas were determined by planimetry. The infarct size was expressed as a percentage of the risk zone.
5.	Primary culture of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
   Cardiac ventricular myocytes were prepared from neonatal (1- to 2-d old) Sprague-Dawley rats as follows. Hearts were excised and the ventricles trisected and incubated with collagenase type II (0.05%) and pancreatin (0.1%). Cardiac myocytes were plated in DMEM culture media supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum.
6.	Determination of MTT formazan formation 
To determine the viability of cardiac myocytes, we carried out the MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay as follows. The MTT assay is based on the ability of mitochondria to reduce MTT (a yellow tetrazolium dye) to MTT formazan (a blue mitochondrial by-product), the reduction is mediated by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in living but not in dead cells. The amount of MTT formazan in DMSO was then measured at a wavelength of 570 nm, using a spectrophotometer.
7.	Preparation of isolated ventricular myocytes
Isolated adult ventricular myocytes from male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained by enzymatic dissociation. Trypan blue exclusion was used as an index of the viability of the ventricular myocytes.
8.	Measurement of the mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species production
Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was measured using the fluorescent dye tetramethyl-rhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). TMRE fluorescence was excited at 514 nm and collected at 590 nm. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured by loading with fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. Levels of DCF in cell lysates or in solutions were measured using 488 nm excitation/530 nm emission settings.
9.	Measurement of myocyte contraction
Myocytes were placed in a chamber mounted on an inverted microscope. The chamber was perfused continuously at 2 ml/min with KH buffer, with 1% BSA and a gas phase of 95% O2/5% CO2 at room temperature. A video-tracking system was used to measure the peak velocity of cell shortening (+dL/dtmax), the peak velocity of cell relengthening (-dL/dtmax), the amplitude of contraction (dL) and the end-diastolic length of the isolated myocytes.


Results
1.	Chronic effect of testosterone propionate on rat body weight and heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury
TP replacement inhibited gonadectomy induced increase of body weights.
Gonadectomy significantly increased the infarct size and LDH release at the time of 5 min reperfusion in the isolated perfused rat heart subjected to 30 min ischemia and 120 min reperfusion compared with untreated control hearts, and TP replacement attenuated the injury of gonadectomy.
2.	Testosterone treatment on cultured cell viability
Testosterone also increases cell viability in primary cultured cardiomyocytes against H2O2-stress.
3.	Testosterone acutely prevents H2O2-induced loss of cardiomyocytes cell viability
Application of H2O2 induced a dose dependent viability loss in cardiomyocytes measured by trypan blue exclusion. Cell death was detected following application of H2O2 (10, 100, 1000 mol/L) for 10 min. Treatment with 100 mol/L H2O2 for 10 min has been shown to cause nearly 60% viability loss in cardiomyocytes. 
Pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with testosterone (T) (10-8, 10-7, 10-6, 10-5, 10-4 mol/L) protected the cells from the toxicity of H2O2, while T at final concentration of 10-9 has no effect. It also showed that T had a dose-dependent cardioprotective effect.
Application of 20 mol/L Atr, a known opener of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, for 20 min before H2O2-stress, significantly attenuated the effects of T on cell viability. Blockade of the mitoKATP channel with a selective inhibitor, 5-HD (100 mol/L) for 10 min before H2O2-stress also abolished the effects of T on cell viability. 
4.	Testosterone prevented H2O2 induced depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential
We observed that H2O2-stress significantly increased the fluorescence intensity, which indicated that the Δψm was depolarized. Pretreatment with T before H2O2-stress prevented the depolarization of Δψm, and co-treatment with Atr or 5-HD attenuated the effect of T.
5.	Testosterone inhibited H2O2 induced ROS production
We observed that H2O2-stress significantly increased the fluorescence intensity, which indicated that ROS were producted largely. Pretreatment with T or CsA before H2O2-stress prevented the production of ROS, and co-treatment with Atr or 5-HD attenuated the effect of T.
6.	Effect of testosterone on contraction of isolated ventricular myocytes 
H2O2-stress (100 μmol/L) produced significant decreases of ±dL/dtmax and dL. 
T attenuated the alterations of cell contraction induced by H2O2-stress. Perfusion with 10-5 mol/L T 10 min prior to H2O2-stress significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of H2O2-stress on +dL/dtmax and dL, and on -dL/dtmax at 2,6,10 min after H2O2-stress.
   Application of 20 mol/L Atr, a known opener of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, for 20 min before H2O2-stress, significantly attenuated the effects of T on +dL/dtmax, while it had effect on -dL/dtmax only at 6 min and on dL at 8, 10 min.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study shows the chronic cardioprotection of testosterone against ischemia/reperfusion injury and acute effect against H2O2-stress injury. Gonadectomy significantly increases the infarct size and LDH release at the time of 5 min reperfusion. Furthermore, the acute cardioprotective effect conferred by testosterone is mediated by inhibiting opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and activating the mitoKATP channel.Alternate abstract:Testosterone抗心肌缺血复灌损伤的慢性与急性效应

背景

据WHO 2004年世界卫生报告统计，由心血管疾病引起的病人死亡率占首位，其中主要是缺血性疾病。在心肌缺血/复灌等病理条件下，由于心肌氧供应减少、导致活性氧产生大大增加是造成细胞损伤的主要原因之一。
雄激素是一类类固醇激素，主要有睾酮（testosterone）、双氢睾酮（dihydrotestosterone）、脱氢异雄酮（dehydroisoandrosterone）和雄烯二酮（androstenedione）。睾丸间质细胞分泌的雄激素主要是睾酮，可以直接作用于核内的雄激素受体，也可以转变为双氢睾酮（作用于雄激素受体的能力是睾酮的两倍）或雌二醇而间接起作用。绝经期前的女性比同龄男性患心血管疾病的几率要小得多，因而普遍认为，雄激素是导致心血管疾病的一种危险因素。但是，也有证据表明患心血管疾病的男性血中睾酮水平要比血管造影片正常人的低。睾酮作为雄激素的主要种类，能够提高性腺机能减退并患有心绞痛病人的心肌缺血阈值和生活质量，具有抗心肌缺血的保护作用。最重要的是，我们发现去势大鼠施行睾酮替代疗法后，提高心肌收缩和抗心肌缺血复灌损伤的功能。
具有促合成代谢作用的雄性类固醇激素（anabolic androgenic steroids，AAS）由多种类固醇组成，由于每种成分药理学效应不同，因此作用比较复杂。至今临床上还没有确实的证据表明雄激素与心血管系统的关系。合成代谢的雄性类固醇激素与心肌缺血、急性心肌梗死、运动员的高血压有关，于是人们认为雄性激素对心血管系统是有害的。流行病学数据和干预学说则显示血液中的雄激素对心血管可能有中性或有益的作用。雄性激素对心血管的损伤作用主要表现在：（1）能够不可逆地改变了膜脂质和脂蛋白的构型；（2）产生血栓症；（3）心肌肥大；（4）可能会导致动脉粥样硬化。有报道发现，去势的大鼠补充睾酮后能够改善心肌抗缺血复灌损伤的功能。这些变化可能是通过雄激素受体介导的基因途径起作用的。
据最近报道，存在一些急性的非雄激素受体介导的途径，如睾酮的短期效应是可以舒张全身的血管、冠状动脉或肺部的血管，从而增加心肌的抗缺血作用。有人在分离的心肌细胞和线粒体上用线粒体荧光和膜片钳技术研究发现，睾酮可以明显地去极化和氧化线粒体，而ATP、5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD)、glibenclamide可以抑制这种作用，表明睾酮通过激活线粒体ATP敏感性钾通道（mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel）对心肌有直接的保护作用。
因此，我们假设雄激素替代疗法不仅通过基因途径对心血管发生作用，可能还通过非基因途径对心血管产生保护作用。基因途径是指雄激素与核内受体结合后，调空基因表达，蛋白合成；非基因途径指雄激素穿透细胞膜后，作用于G蛋白偶联的受体，进一步激活PKA，PKC等下游途径，以线粒体上的相关通道或孔道为靶点发挥心血管保护作用。

目的

大鼠双侧输精管结扎，睾丸摘除，每天补充雄激素（200 g/100 g体重），建立雄激素替代疗法模型。给药8周后，大鼠开胸取心脏，Langendorff装置上离体灌流，观察睾酮替代疗法的慢性心血管效应；在原代培养的乳鼠心肌细胞模型上，MTT法测定细胞存活率。在分离细胞模型上，台盼蓝拒染法测定心肌细胞存活率，视频跟踪系统观察单细胞收缩功能，测定线粒体膜电位和ROS生成情况；以线粒体上的多种通道/孔道为切入点，利用多种工具药（阻断剂/开放剂），深入研究睾酮急性心肌保护作用的具体机制。

离体心脏复灌120 min后再结扎冠脉，取1％伊文思蓝经主动脉注入心脏，冷冻后与心脏纵轴垂直切成2 mm均匀薄片，采用双染色法染色，使用Image软件(NIH)测量相关区域面积，计算梗死区占危险区的比值。

5.	乳鼠心肌细胞培养
取生后1-2d的SD大鼠心室肌，剪成1 mm3大小后，用含0.1%胰蛋白酶和0.05％胶原酶Ⅱ的溶液（37℃)消化10 min，收集心肌细胞悬液，并用8 ml含15%胎牛血清的DMEM（高糖）培养液中和胰酶作用。重复消化收集8-10次，直到心肌组织完全解离，以1200 rpm离心6 min，所得的沉淀用10 ml DMEM(15%胎牛血清)重悬，然后置于二氧化碳培养箱（95%空气+5% CO2，37℃)中预培养，1 h后悬浮的心肌细胞用200目不锈钢网过滤。

6.	MTT法测定细胞存活率
活细胞中的琥珀酸脱氢酶可使MTT（3-（4，5-二甲基噻唑-2）-2，5-二苯基四氮唑溴盐）分解产生蓝色结晶状formazan沉淀于细胞内和细胞周围。其量与细胞数呈正比，也与细胞活力呈正比。

7.	心室肌细胞分离及存活率测定
用酶解法分离成年大鼠心室肌细胞。大鼠处死后，迅速取出心脏，置于4℃氧饱和Tyrode氏液中洗净血液后固定于Langendorff灌流装置上进行恒流（10 ml/min）灌流（37℃)。先以无钙Tyrode氏液灌流5 min，再以含I型胶原酶0.3 g/L的无钙Tyrode氏液灌流10 min。将心室肌剪碎，于含0.1％BSA的无钙Tyrode氏液中37℃孵育15 min，细胞悬液用200 m的尼龙网过滤，滤液在无钙Tyrode氏液中40 min内，每10 min一次逐步复钙至Ca2+浓度为1.25 mmol/L。台盼蓝拒染法测定心肌细胞存活率。0.4％台盼蓝染色3 min后，死细胞蓝染，活细胞不染色，显微镜下分别计算死细胞和活细胞个数。

8.	线粒体膜电位和ROS生成的测定

9.	单个心肌细胞收缩的测定
将100 l细胞悬液滴于灌流槽中，以95％ O2+5％ CO2饱和的K-H液持续灌流，流速为2 ml/min。在灌流槽中施加频率为0.2 Hz、强度为50 V的电场刺激，待细胞收缩稳定15 min后，镜下选择横纹清晰、胞膜光整的杆状细胞，以计算机辅助的MedEase视频跟踪系统检测单个心室肌细胞收缩参数。


结果

1．	丙酸睾酮替代疗法对大鼠体重及抗心肌缺血复灌损伤的慢性作用
9周后，与正常对照组比较，去势组大鼠体重显著增加，丙酸睾酮（200 g/100 g体重, 8周）处理后大鼠体重明显下降。与去势组相比，丙酸睾酮处理显著地减少缺血复灌后心肌梗死面积和冠脉流出液中LDH释放量。

2.	睾酮对H2O2应激引起的心肌细胞存活率的影响
    与正常组相比，100 mol/L H2O2处理6 h后，心肌细胞MTT值显著降低；睾酮预处理（10-5 mol/L, 10 min）能够显著增加心肌细胞MTT值。

3.	睾酮对H2O2应激引起的心肌细胞存活率的影响以及可能机制
不同浓度的H2O2（10，100，1000 μmol/L）均能引起心肌细胞存活率的降低，并呈现剂量依赖效应。与正常细胞相比，100 μmol/L H2O2处理5 min后，台盼蓝染色法测定的心肌细胞存活率约降低56％。
睾酮对心肌细胞存活率的作用存在剂量依赖效应。与H2O2组相比，睾酮（10-8, 10-7, 10-6, 10-5, 10-4 mol/L）预处理10 min均显著增加心肌细胞的存活率，而浓度为10-9 mol/L的睾酮无显著增加心肌细胞的存活率的作用。10-5 mol/L睾酮组增加心肌细胞的存活率的作用与10-6 mol/L睾酮组有显著差异，而与10-4 mol/L睾酮组无显著差异。又根据文献报道，故后续实验我们采用浓度为10-5 mol/L的睾酮处理。
H2O2应激前加入线粒体通透性转换孔开放剂atractyloside（Atr，20 mmol/L）预处理20 min或加入5-HD（100 mmol/L）预处理10 min并于末10 min给予睾酮（10-5 mol/L）处理，均减小睾酮（10-5 mol/L，10 min）预处理增加心肌细胞存活率的作用。

4.	睾酮对H2O2应激的心肌细胞线粒体TMRE荧光值的影响以及可能机制
与对照组相比，H2O2应激（100 mol/L）显著地增加心肌细胞荧光值，睾酮（10-5 mol/L）预处理能够减少H2O2应激引起的心肌细胞荧光值ΔF增加。
H2O2应激前加入Atr（20 mmol/L）预处理20 min或加入5-HD（100 mmol/L）预处理10 min并于末10 min给予睾酮（10-5 mol/L）处理，均减小睾酮（10-5 mol/L，10 min）预处理降低心肌细胞荧光值ΔF的作用。

5.	睾酮对H2O2应激导致的ROS生成量变化的影响及可能机制
与对照组相比，H2O2应激组心肌细胞DCF荧光值显著增加，睾酮（10-5 mol/L）或CsA(0.2 μmol/L)预处理能够减少H2O2应激引起的心肌细胞DCF荧光值增加。
H2O2应激前加入Atr（20 mmol/L）预处理20 min或加入5-HD（100 mmol/L）预处理10 min并于末10 min给予睾酮（10-5mol/L）处理，均减小睾酮（10-5 mol/L，10 min）预处理降低心肌细胞DCF荧光值的作用。

6.	睾酮预处理对H2O2应激引起的心肌细胞收缩动力学变化的影响

T1  - Effect of environmental air temperature and composition on the development of the Norway rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>)
AN  - 305334664
AB  - In the wild, Norway rats successfully reproduce in climates ranging from the arctic to the tropics. The offspring are born and reared in burrows that offer limited protection from the surface environmental temperature and generally have elevated carbon dioxide concentrations. Because the young are born with little insulation, poor motor coordination, and immature thermal and respiratory regulatory abilities, the air properties of the postnatal environment present considerable thermal and respiratory challenges for rat neonates. Yet, little was known about if, when, and how the air temperature and composition of the postnatal environment affects the development of the young. Therefore, the effect of these factors on the morphological, physiological, and behavioral development of rat pups was examined. Environmental air temperature (cool 17°C, moderate 25°C, and warm 33°C) affected the development of body mass, hair coat mass, tail length, body length, ear length, and hind foot length, as well as food consumption, metabolic rate, and thermal preference. Environmental air composition (0% CO2 and 5% CO2) affected body mass, body length, air composition preference, and blood pH. These results indicate that despite their relative immaturity rat young detect and respond to environmental air factors.

T1  - An evaluation of the wildlife impacts of offshore wind development relative to fossil fuel power production
AN  - 305323972
AB  - Off the eastern coast of the United States lies a unique and untapped natural resource that has only recently been recognized: offshore wind energy. Hailed by many as a clean, virtually limitless source of renewable energy, offshore wind energy has great potential for reducing air pollution, lessening the United States' dependence on foreign oil supply, and mitigating the impacts of global climate change. The promises of offshore wind energy, however, are not without pitfalls. Potential adverse impacts on local and migrating wildlife species are frequently cited as an important issue of concern when considering the development and siting of an offshore wind facility. These concerns are not without merit: impacts to wildlife species may occur during all phases of offshore wind development, and include habitat alteration, habitat displacement, increased levels of underwater noise and vibration, and in some cases, mortality.    This research concludes that from a quantitative perspective, Brayton Point has a larger impact on wildlife species than Cape Wind. The former includes hundreds of birds killed by oil spills, thousands of acres of land disturbed, and billions of fish, fish larvae, and fish eggs killed annually by entrainment, impingement, and thermal discharge. The effects of acid precipitation and heavy metal contamination are also known to have long-lasting impacts on wildlife species, including habitat exclusion, physical impairment, and reduced breeding potential. While offshore wind facilities are not without their own set of adverse impacts on wildlife species, these impacts must not be viewed in isolation. It is only when the wildlife impacts of offshore wind development are compared relative to those from fossil fuel power production can they be truly understood. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Ecophysiology of coastal <i>Koelreuteria paniculata</i>
AN  - 305321509
AB  - Koelreuteria paniculata is an Asian tree whose range spans mainland China and includes disjunct populations on the Korean Peninsula and Japan. Most of the non-Chinese populations are coastal, surviving at the ocean's edge where they are subjected to significant salt-spray pressure. It is an early-successional species that exhibits substantial photosynthetic and morphological plasticity under different irradiance levels. Despite compromised growth and photosynthetic rates under shade, it acclimated to limiting light by decreasing light compensation point and dark respiration rate, as well as increasing the amount of chlorophyll b. Shade-acclimated trees rapidly increased photosynthetic potential after transfer to full sun, which led to substantial increases in biomass and height. Trees growing under dense canopies would respond similarly under natural conditions, such as gap formation.    Coastal provenances measured in the field maintained high photosynthetic rates despite salt-spray induced leaflet chlorosis, necrosis, and curling. In greenhouse experiments where coastal and inland genotypes were exposed to artificial salt spray, coastal trees developed less chlorosis and necrosis, and maintained higher photosynthetic rates. Inland provenances were less tolerant of salt spray, developing severe leaflet necrosis, curling, and compromised photosynthetic rates. Leaves of both site types possessed hydrophilic surfaces, and salt retention and deposition did not differ between them. Plasticity in leaflet succulence was universal, although the increase was greatest in coastal provenances and may help to explain their enhanced tolerance to salt spray. Leaflet curling in response to salt spray was greatest in the inland provenances and may decrease photoinhibition by minimizing direct solar radiation.    Salt deposits increased leaflet reflectance without altering absorptance or transmittance. Coincident with the increase in reflectance was the maintenance of lower leaflet temperatures upon exposure to high radiation from an artificial light source. Salts accumulated on leaflets in a non-random pattern, with greater amounts in veins, compared to interveinal regions; deposition also increased from the midrib to the margin. This pattern, the wadi effect, when coupled to rapid wash-off facilitated by leaflet curvature, may prevent the accumulation of salts to injurious levels.

T1  - Physiological diversity and temperature hardening in adult tick <i>Dermacentor variabilis</i> (Acari: Ixodidae)
AN  - 305303130
AB  - Ticks employ an array of survival traits in response to adverse environmental conditions including behavior, active water-vapor uptake, integumental restriction of water loss, slow metabolism/respiration, and tolerance of temperature extremes. This dissertation studied the rapid heat hardening and rapid cold hardening traits, which increase tolerance to temperature extremes in Dermacentor variabilis. An unexpected physiological diversity was found in our studies, which added an interesting dimension to the project. Ultimately, survival experiments demonstrated that there was a seasonal (summer vs. winter) or 'batch' effect, apparently caused by when ticks were laboratory reared.    In high temperature (45°C) survival studies, high and low temperature cross-tolerance was ambiguous in summer-acclimated ticks whereas it was clearly demonstrated in winter-acclimated ticks. Likewise, in low temperature (-10°C) survival studies, the high and low temperature cross-tolerance was clearly demonstrated in summer ticks, but not in winter ticks. Seasonal acclimation seems to play a principle role, while rapid hardening adds supplemental benefits by protecting D. variabilis against high and low temperature injuries.    Two clones of Hsp70 were identified and characterized in D. variabilis  and named Hsp70S (short form, 1540 bp) and Hsp70L (long form, 1727 bp). Hsp70S and Hsp70L share 95% nucleic acid sequence identity with the differences at their 3' ends. They share 81% nucleic acid identity and 87% amino acid similarity with an Hsp70 of the deer tick, Ixodes scapularis. The Northern expression of Hsp70S was much higher compared to Hsp70L in response to high temperature exposures. Synthesis of Hsp70 in response to cold- and desiccation-acclimation was slight and delayed. Neither the field collected natural population (in summer) nor the outdoor acclimated (in winter) lab-reared ticks showed any higher level of Hsp70 expression than the controls.    Rapid hardening correlates with concomitant increases in hemolymph osmotic pressure, glycerol and sorbitol concentrations in D. variabilis. Glycerol plays a significant protective role for D. variabilis against low and high temperature injuries. Sorbitol might play a secondary role, but its concentration is only thousandth of glycerol. This study increases our understanding of this tick's survival traits and helps explain its impressive diversity in northern temperate America.

T1  - Gender differences during heat strain at critical WBGT
AN  - 305264790
AB  - Heat stress is influenced by environmental conditions, workload and clothing. A critical environment is the upper limit of compensable heat stress for a given metabolic rate and clothing ensemble. The physiological strains associated with heat stress are core and skin temperatures, heart rate and Physiological Strain Index (PSI). Because heat dissipation mechanisms may differ between men and women, there may be gender differences in the critical environment and the associated physiological variables. Gender differences were explored between acclimated men (n = 20) and women (n = 9) at the upper limit of compensable heat stress. Participants walked on a motorized treadmill at a target metabolic rate of 160W/m2 while wearing five different clothing ensembles (cotton work clothes, cotton coveralls, and three coveralls of particle barrier, liquid barrier, and vapor barrier properties). The starting air temperature (Tdb) was 34°C and humidity was held constant at 50%. Once thermal equilibrium was achieved, Tdb was increased 1°C every five minutes until loss of thermal equilibrium or termination criteria were met. Upon initial analysis, several gender differences were found. A significant difference (p = 0.035) was found for WBGTcrit, where values were 32.5°C for men and 33.1°C for women. Women had higher average heart rates (HR = 125 and 112 bpm), average skin temperatures (Tsk = 36.4 and 36.2°C), and PSI values (4.5 and 3.8) than men. No significant difference was found between genders for core temperature (Tre) (p = 0.147). The target metabolic rate of 160W/m2 was not achieved and there were significant differences (p < 0.0001) between men (172 W/m2) and women (152 W/m2). The effect of metabolic rate on WBGTcrit was examined and it was discovered that the difference in WBGTcrit could be explained by the difference in metabolic rate. The same logic was applied to the physiological responses and confirmed a difference between genders for Tre, HR, and PSI. The differences for Tsk disappeared. These findings indicate that women experienced a greater cardiovascular strain at the critical condition and also greater heat strain than men at the same heat load.

T1  - Assessment of occupational heat strain
AN  - 305262419
AB  - Assessment of heat strain considers an individual's tolerance and indicates the risk and physiological cost of working in hot environments. This study evaluated the discrimination ability of metrics of heat strain. The null hypotheses were that (1) the metrics individually could not discriminate between acceptable and unacceptable heat strain, (2) there were no significant differences among these metrics, and (3) there were no significant differences in the applicability of the metrics due to clothing or heat stress level.    The experimental design was a case crossover. Clothing and heat stress level were potential confounders. Two clothing ensembles were work clothes and vapor-barrier coveralls with hood. Two heat stress levels for a moderate metabolic rate were 5°C-WBGT and 10°C-WBGT above the Threshold Limit Value adjusted for clothing. Eight male and four female acclimated individuals (age 18-36 years) participated. Four experimental trials were randomized in sequence. The transition point, when a participant's status changed from control (acceptable heat strain) to case (unacceptable), was the first occurrence of rectal temperature equal to or greater than 38.5°C, heart rate equal to or greater than 90% of maximum, or volitional fatigue. The metrics were rectal, ear canal, oral, and disk temperatures, heart rate including moving time averages of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 45 minutes, recovery heart rate, and physiological strain index. The data at the transition point were the case data; the data 10 minutes prior to that point were the control data. Analyses used primarily receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which indicated the ability to distinguish acceptable from unacceptable heat strain. Further analyses included factorial analysis of variance and exact conditional logistic regression.    Based on the ROC curve analyses, the physiological metrics can distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable heat strain with average area under the curves between 0.529 and 0.861. While there were no differences among the metrics based on the 95% confidence intervals of the areas under the curve, the results were compromised by low power. Based on ANOVA and logistic regression, clothing did not influence the metrics. There were insufficient data to evaluate the role of heat stress level.

T1  - Noise limits to low -light vision: Thermal noise in the retinae of rockfish (genus <i>Sebastes</i>)
AN  - 304978666
AB  - Thermal noise caused by temperature-induced rhodopsin isomerizations may set limits to low-light visual sensitivity in ectothermic organisms. I examine low-light absolute sensitivity in congeneric nearshore fishes within the genus Sebastes to determine: whether low-light sensitivity is affected by environmentally relevant temperature changes, and, if so, whether sensitivity levels acclimate to compensate for changes in sensitivity resulting from changes in ambient temperature, and, last, how changes in low-light visual sensitivity translate into changes in organisms' ecological interactions.    This study is based on measurement of absolute dark-adapted visual thresholds from intact fish determined using an in situ electroretinogram (ERG) in black, blue, olive, and kelp rockfish. For all species, 10°C increase in temperature yields a 10-fold increase in the threshold stimulus irradiance. Activation energy (Ea) of the process underlying temperature dependence of absolute sensitivity is estimated from the Arrhenius relationship for rates of rhodopsin isomerizations/rod/second at thresholds. The revealed Ea is 36+/-3 kcal/mol, within the literature range for rhodopsin isomerization. However, while temperature dependence of absolute sensitivity for all species is similar, sensitivity levels differ between black and blue rockfish, and kelp and olive rockfish. This correlates with reported diel activity patterns. Nocturnal species (olive and kelp) have greater visual sensitivity than diurnal congeners. I suggest that visual sensitivity structures diel activity patterns in this rockfish community. Potential acclimation to long-term temperature change (days to weeks) was tested by acclimating blue rockfish to 7, 13 and 18°C. Threshold sensitivity was measured subsequent to thermal acclimation treatments. No effect of acclimation treatment was found. Ecological significance of varying retinal sensitivity was examined using computational models of submarine light environments to determine how changes in threshold sensitivity translate into visual activity window durations. The model predicts that seasonal temperature changes (∼4° C) have little ecological impact, but greater changes in temperature will affect visual activity windows. Visual activity window durations are compared between diurnal and nocturnal species. The greater sensitivity of nocturnal species translates into a 3-5 hour advantage in daily visual activity window over diurnal congeners. Additionally, rockfish community diel activity patterns are predicted to be sensitive to increasing light pollution.

T1  - Comparative studies of metabolic and cardiac physiology in tunas
AN  - 304977998
AB  - Tunas are noted for traits that enhance physiological performance, including the ability to maintain elevated temperatures in swimming muscle, viscera, brain and eye tissues, however the heart operates at ambient temperature. Among tunas, bluefin maintain the highest internal temperatures and have the broadest thermal niches, making their physiological performance and its response to temperature particularly interesting. This study presents measurements of heart function and oxygen consumption of Pacific bluefin and yellowfin tunas at temperatures encompassing those encountered in the wild.    Cooling reduces heart rates and cardiac outputs of bluefin and yellowfin hearts in situ, suggesting a physiological limit in cold waters. However, bluefin hearts are less temperature sensitive than those of yellowfin, matching the wider thermal niche of bluefin. Bluefin hearts beat rhythmically at 2°C, corresponding to the lowest ambient temperatures observed in tracks of wild bluefin tuna. The cold tolerance of bluefin hearts is associated with increased cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ cycling.    Minimum metabolic rates of bluefin and yellowfin tunas swimming in a swim-tunnel at 20°C after a two day fast and overnight acclimation period were 222 ± 24 mg O2 kg-1 hr-1 and 162 ± 19 mg O2 kg-1 hr-1, respectively. The higher VO2 of bluefin accords with biochemical and tissue-level physiological characteristics. VO2 results lower than those in the literature for yellowfin suggest that previous measurements may not represent a basal physiological state.    A remarkable U-shaped relationship of VO2 to temperature was observed in bluefin swimming at a fixed speed of 1.0 length s-1. A minimum VO2, or potential thermoneutral zone, was evident at 15--20°C, with increases in VO2 at 8--10°C as well as 25°C. At higher speeds, VO2 was similar among different temperatures, suggesting that bluefin increase muscular heat production to thermoregulate at low ambient temperatures. Muscle temperature measurements will be required to test this hypothesis.    The finding that bluefin have high metabolic rates and enhanced heart function relative to tropical tunas supports an evolutionary linkage of endothermy, increased metabolic rate, high heart rates, and intracellular Ca2+  cycling in heart cells.

T1  - Climatic effects of urbanization: Urban, suburban and rural microclimates in the Chicago region
AN  - 304954542
AB  - Urban microclimates are discrete regions in the urban canopy layer where values of radiative and meteorological variables deviate from their averages over larger spatial scales. The canopy extends from street-level to mean building height. The energy balance framework described here, combined with relevant site measurements, permits quantitative assessments of the mechanisms controlling surface temperatures in microclimates. There are substantial differences in the fluxes of solar and thermal radiation, sensible heat transport, evaporation, conduction, air and surface temperatures, and wind speeds across microclimates in regions that should not be assumed to be homogeneous. Anthropogenic surface alterations appear to be responsible for some of these differences.    Measurements were recorded at four locations with varying levels of urban development. The net all-wave energy flux, RNET, represents the limit to the input of energy at the surface and equals the sum of incoming solar and thermal radiation minus the sum of reflected and emitted values. Typically, over a period of 24 hours more radiation is incident on a surface than is reflected and emitted by it. This net gain would result in perpetual heating unless other fluxes dissipated the excess. Those fluxes are sensible heat transport, evaporation and conduction. Thus net radiation equals the sum of the model-derived energy fluxes, such that RNET = ± QSENS ± QCOND + QEVAP.    The demand for energy to heat or cool interior spaces depends on both outdoor air temperatures and the temperatures of built surfaces, especially the roofs and walls of buildings exposed to the atmosphere. The temperature of a solid surface differs from the air temperature and is a function of its properties, such as albedo, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and availability of liquid water for evaporation. This study demonstrates how the external surroundings of a structure influence its surface temperature. The interplay of these factors produces microclimates, typified by an urban canyon and a non-canyon urban site studied here. Although these sites are in close geographic proximity, they experience different diurnal cycles in surface temperature and, hence, have different requirements for interior temperature control.

T1  - Molecular analysis of encystment and diapause in <i>Artemia</i>: Gene expression and stress response
AN  - 304952121
AB  - During oviparous development, Artemia embryos encyst and enter diapause, a condition characterized by low metabolic activity and high tolerance to environmental stress. Entry into diapause is thought to involve differential gene expression leading to synthesis of regulatory and structural proteins that modulate organismal behavior, and during diapause stress proteins are may protect encysted embryos. Subtractive hybridization was utilized to recover several up-regulated genes, including those that encode the small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) ArHsp21 and ArHsp22, and p8, a cotranscription factor. Full length cDNAs of ArHsp21 and ArHsp22 encode 181 and 190 amino acid residues, respectively, with a conserved α-crystallin domain. ArHsp21 and ArHsp22 form oligomers and exhibit chaperone activity, functional characteristics of most sHSPs. These sHSPs are detected during oviparous but not ovoviviparous development and upon exposure of adult Artemia to thermal stress, synthesis of ArHsp22 was observed. In contrast, instar II larvae synthesized neither ArHsp21 nor ArHsp22 in response to heat shock. ArHsp21 and ArHsp22 have the potential to protect Artemia embryos during development, whereas only ArHsp22 is stress inducible. Artemia p8 contains 66 amino acid residues and its sequence is similar to p8 from other organisms. Probing of Southern blots indicated a single p8 gene in Artemia. p8 transcripts are present in low amounts in oocytes prior to fertilization and increase rapidly, peaking at one day post-fertilization during oviparous but not ovoviviparous development. p8 protein is present at two days post-fertilization and is found in encysted embryos released from females, where it was detected in nuclei by immunofluorescent staining. The properties of p8 are consistent with a role in regulation of Artemia entry into encystment. As a representative of Artemia sHSPs, p26 gene structure was analyzed, revealing four exons and three introns, with one intron in the 5'-untranslated region. Cis-acting elements such as putative estrogen and Ap-1 binding sites, and heat shock elements, were found in the first intron and the 5'-flanking upstream region of the p26 gene, and they may contribute to developmental regulation of this gene.

T1  - Comparison of molecular biomarkers within and across scleractinian coral species exposed to elevated temperatures
AN  - 304934636
AB  - There has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of bleaching events on scleractinian corals since 1980. Coral bleaching in 1998 was the most extensive and severe ever recorded. These large scale bleaching episodes can result in up to 100% mortality in some areas, and major bleaching events are predicted to increase in frequency over the next few decades as a result of increasing temperatures from global warming. Many coral species are living close to their thermotolerance limits and it is unclear if corals will be able to survive further increases in mean sea surface temperatures. Will certain species suffer high levels of mortality that could drive them to extinction, and which species will acclimate to these changes? This research compares thermotolerance levels between (Pocillopora damicornis and Pocillopora meandrina) and looks at the acclimation potential of P. meandrina to elevated temperatures.    Colonies of P. damicornis from Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, and colonies of P. meandrina from a thermal outfall site and a control site at Kahe with normal ambient sea surface temperatures, were exposed to different temperatures. Temperatures at the outfall site were up to 5°C higher than the surrounding water. Not only did this allow for comparison of thermotolerance between the 2 species, but comparisons for acclimation potential could be made between P. meandrina colonies from the thermal outfall and the control site. Several molecular biomarkers were evaluated during this research to assess photosynthetic efficiency in the zooxanthellae and antioxidant levels in the coral host. In 2002, the Ferric Reducing/Antioxidant Potential Assay (FRAP) was adapted to be used with corals to measure antioxidant levels in the coral. In 2003, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) using catalase antibodies were used along with FRAP to corroborate the results from the FRAP method, since FRAP measures not only antioxidants in a sample but also chemical reductants which could have no antioxidant activity. ELISAs using several other antibodies were performed also to examine different cellular parameters that could be related to stress. Photosynthetic efficiency was measured using Pulse Amplitude Modulated (PAM) Fluorometry to measure damage to Photosystem II in the chloroplasts of the zooxanthellae.    The combined results of this research show that P. meandrina  from the outfall site can tolerate elevated temperatures better than conspecifics from a nearby control population. This could be the result of acclimation to higher temperatures found near the thermal outfall.  Pocillopora meandrina is regarded as one of the more thermosensitive species on Hawaiian reefs. The reactions of P. meandrina from the outfall are similar to P. damicornis, which is adapted to shallower environments with greater fluctuations in temperature and irradiance. Acclimation of P. meandrina to the conditions at the outfall site has occurred in less than 30 years. This might suggest that some coral species will be able to acclimate to the present trends in global warming after initial episodes of mass mortality, which could be already occurring on reefs around the world.

T1  - Physiological and biochemical responses of <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> to emersion.
AN  - 301674886
AB  - The relationships between the physiological and biochemical responses of Crassostrea gigas to emersion duration were studied with the aim of simulating better current systems for the live marketing of these oysters.  The results showed that C. gigas has evolved a variety of strategies that make it a very emersion tolerant species.  All of the oysters used survived >12 d under emersion at 2 different temperatures (4 and 10°C).  Gross weight loss was positively and linearly related to emersion duration and their shell-buffering capacity helped stabilise internal pH and minimised acidification at the gill surface.  Such acid-base balance adjustments stabilised the mantle cavity fluid (MCF) pH after ~24h of emersion.  A continuous efflux of ammonia into the haemolymph and MCF occurred under emersion.  An altered behaviour to include intermittent valve-gaping and a release of ammonia to the external medium occurred within 1 min after re-immersion.
  The haemolymph FAA pool comprised principally taurine and valine and both decreased significantly (p < 0.05) during the first 24h under emersion.  Alanine showed no significant change under emersion but succinate levels showed significant increases initially but, as emersion lengthened, returned to original levels.  Many intermediates or end-products may accumulate and are therefore responsible for a part of the consumed fuel substrates.
  A complex of emersion-induced changes confer an emersion tolerance that equips C. gigas to live in habitats that experience periodic or episodic severe hypoxia.  This ability and the ability to recover rapidly upon re-immersion have important commercial implications for the development of efficient systems suitable for the live marketing of this valuable species.

T1  - Treatment of surface boundary layer parameters for modelling air quality in urban regions
AN  - 301674734
AB  - This research project aims at improving the treatment of surface boundary layer (SBL) properties in a simple approach model, PEARL, and an advanced Eulerian model, MM5-CMAQ, through the use of satellite derived land cover data for the London area.
  Land cover data has been derived from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH). Within the  PEARL model surface roughness, thermal, and moisture properties are assigned according to land cover categories in each 1x1 km grid cell. To avoid complexities from atmospheric chemical processes, the model has been used to predict annual and monthly CO concentrations. The performance of the model has been assessed with measurements from several air quality stations. Compared to the original model without the treatment of surface characteristics, the modified model performs better in term of horizontal distribution of pollutants. The predicted concentration magnitudes based on the modified PEARL were found to be improved in most cases.
  An additional land category, suburban, has been introduced in the MM5 model. The performance of the resulting model has been examined for wind components, surface heat fluxes, PBL height, and vertical temperature profiles according to their crucial roles on air pollution episode development. The model results are compared with the original MM5, without the changes of land cover, and the observations to determine the impacts of CEH land cover data on the meteorological predictions. MM5-CMAQ system has also been used to examine the changes of having the additional category on predictions of CO, NOx and O3. A simple emission processor has been developed to pre-process emission inventories for CMAQ. The influence of meteorological fields on biogenic emissions due to land cover changes is also taken into account.
  In terms of meteorological results, the strength of global radiation has been found to play an important role in the heat balance over urban area. The surface roughness exerts a large influence on wind speeds which in turn influences the dilution of air pollutant.
  In terms of air pollution modelling, only a limited number of appropriate air quality monitoring stations were identified to test the performance of MM5-CMAQ (CEH version).

T1  - Coagulation, gelation and crystallisation in dairy colloids: analysis and optimisation of the functional characteristics
AN  - 301669460
AB  - The research and development of new products, such as heat stable calcium fortified low fat milk, and products that deliver increased consumer-desired benefits, such as low temperature spreadable natural butter, is demonstrated.  In parallel with this the potential for a novel technique, high-resolution ultrasonic spectroscopy, for the investigation of key microstructural processes in dairy colloids, is presented.
  Analysis of key processes responsible for the macroscopic behaviour of dairy colloids, such as coagulation and crystallisation, were performed.  This analysis resulted in the ability to manipulate these processes to achieve improvements in traditional products and develop new dairy colloid products.  Procedures, such as thermal and mechanical treatments, involved in the manufacture and use of certain dairy colloids, which affect product stability and quality, were also investigated.
  The analysis of processes involved in dairy colloids requires novel techniques, as in the past traditional techniques have been pushed to their operational limits, and were often destructive to samples, time consuming and difficult to perform. Traditional analytical techniques do not always provide the ability to investigate the microstructural processes and characteristics in dairy systems. Novel techniques, such as high-resolution ultrasonic spectroscopy, may be utilised to study key processes, such as the sol-gel transition in milk gels, and to provide key information on structural characteristics, such as thy physical state of the crystal matrix in butter, as demonstrated here.
  The knowledge acquired and the resulting product development and product improvement methods arising from this work have been transferred to our industrial partner and implemented in industry-specific projects, namely a calcium fortification of milk project and butter spreadability project.

In study one agreement between measures of body temperature from the rectum (criterion), aural (ear) canal and intestines was assessed during a 40 min Cycling Intennittent Sprint Protocol (CISP). Peak rectal temperatures in the temperate and hot conditions were 38.4 ± 0.3°C and 38.8 ± 0.6 °C, respectively. Both aural and intestinal temperature displayed statistically acceptable agreement with rectal temperature within a range of 1.2°C. However, this range of agreement was not deemed clinically acceptable, so rectal thermometry remained the criterion measure. In study two, heat strain was quantified using a physiological strain index (PSI) that classified strain on a scale of 0 (no strain) to 10 (very high strain). The PSI was higher (8.2 ± 0.5 Units; P < 0.05) whilst perfonning the CISP in hot compared to temperate conditions (7.0 ± 0.5 Units). The PSI was negatively correlated to peak power output (PPo; r = -0.80, P < 0.01) in the heat and PPO declined after 10 sprints (P < 0.05). In the temperate condition, PSI showed no correlation with PPO and no decline in PPO occurred. Heat strain (PSI) in study three was lower during the CISP using a recovery intensity of 35% peak oxygen consumption (VOzpeak) compared to 50% VOzpeak as had been used in studies one and two. Concomitantly, the reduction in PPO of individual sprints was delayed by 5 sprints and average PPO was ~ 4% higher during 35% V02peak in the heat (1165 ± 154 W) than during 50% VOzpeak in the heat (1120 ± 190 W; Main effect; P < 0.05). To determine if pre-cooling could alleviate heat strain further, study four examined 20 minutes of water immersion, or wearing an ice vest, or ice packs placed on the legs, compared to a control condition. All pre-cooling techniques reduced the PSI and rectal temperature, and water immersion and ice packs also reduced muscle temperature (0.7 ± 2.3 °C and 1.0 ± 6.6 °C; P < 0.05, respectively). Peak power output in the control condition (1132 ± 112 W) was reduced by ~ 1% after water immersion (1126 ± 118 W), increased by ~1% after wearing the ice vest (1149 ± 127 W) and ice packs improved PPO by ~4% (1181 ± 149 W; P < 0.05). The combination of ice pack pre-cooling and heat acclimation was investigated for the final study. Muscle damage and the cellular response to exercise induced heat strain were also investigated. These were assessed through the changes in blood plasma creatine kinase (CK) and heat stress protein 70 (HSP70) concentrations, respectively. Ten days of heat acclimation improved PPO (~3%; Main effect, P < 0.05) during the CISP in the heat, but the further precooling was not additionally ergogenic. During the CISP in the heat, prior to heat acclimation, significant changes of plasma CK (208 ± 233 U/L; P < 0.05) and HSP70 (0.027 ± 0.016 ng'ml 1; P < 0.05) concentrations were observed. However these changes were not observed after heat acclimation. This indicated increased cellular thermo-tolerance against temperature and exercise induced muscle damage and may be linked to the ergogenic response observed. This thesis confirms a direct relationship between heat strain and intermittent sprint exercise performance whilst under heat stress. Manipulation of heat strain can be achieved by using different interventions that can improve intermittent sprint exercise performance. These results are most relevant to unacclimated games players competing in hot, humid conditions.

T1  - Plasticity in arthropod cryotypes - a polar perspective.
AN  - 301661821
AB  - Polar terrestrial arthropods live at the edge of the biological limits of life. They provide natural models of both extreme cryotypes and cryotypic diversity. Models of chill-tolerance and freeze tolerance were used to examine the methodology, theory, and expression of low temperature adaptation. Crystallisation temperature (Tc) is shown to be a deterministic probe of cold hardiness, multi modal in expression, and significantly affected by both exogenous (e.g. acclimation/acclimatization temperature) and endogenous (e.g. moulting) factors. Plasticity in acclimation potential varies between the species examined from absent (e.g. substituted by freeze tolerance) to seasonally circumscribed, to 'superplastic'. Thus plasticity may be associated with a highly adapted level of cold tolerance - both in terms of the magnitude of the change in physiological state, and in terms of its degree of environment sensitivity. By contrast, freeze tolerance in an insect (i.e. without plasticity but also with a high degree of evolutionary derivation) is shown to be a metabolically efficient strategy. Plasticity in these cold-adapted species might therefore be seen to operate as a correlative of a given species' sensitivity to temporal and spatial variability in thermal heterogeneity. Environmental heterogeneity in polar environments may take many forms. Supplemental studies on passive vectors - wind and water - examine their role in the dispersal and distribution of Antarctic springtails.

T1  - Phytoplankton dynamics in North Island lakes, New Zealand
AN  - 2313370222
AB  - The dynamics of phytoplankton were investigated in 40 lakes of the North Island, New Zealand. A range of environmental variables was examined on different temporal and spatial scales in relation to the surface and DCM ( deep chlorophyll maximum) phytoplankton communities in the lakes. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a potentially toxic species of cyanobacteria, that in summer 2002-3 formed dense water blooms in shallow Waikato peat lakes and a hydro-electric dam on the Waikato River. Net rates of growth demonstrated that C. raciborskii populations grew at rates close to maximum values observed under optimal conditions in laboratory cultures. Changes in species diversity in the lakes prior to and following the invasion of C. raciborskii were assessed. During occasions of C. raciborskii water blooms there was decreased diversity and the phytoplankton assemblage became nearly mono-specific. The shallow lakes in this study have high concentrations of nutrients and low water clarity, which are ideal conditions for growth of C. raciborskii. The ability of C. raciborskii to fix nitrogen may also have enhanced its competitive ability amongst other phytoplankton species and, while nutrients were generally considered to be replete, nitrogen was more likely to limit growth of phytoplankton than phosphorus in the lakes studied.  Lake Tarawera was chosen to investigate variability of phytoplankton biomass with depth and between embayments and a mid-lake station. The variability of DCM depth was contributed by internal seiching, which was most prominent at the edge of the lake. A single mid-lake station was considered representative of lake-wide biomass at the DCM as the differences between stations were small. During periods when bloom-forming species are present, several sampling stations should be used to adequately quantify biomass and variability of phytoplankton in the surface mixed layer.  A population-dynamics theory of sinking phytoplankton, that utilizes interactions between growth limitation by light and nutrients, sinking rates and turbulent diffusion rates, was used to quantify factors contributing to DCM formation in Lake Tarawera.  A DCM was simulated when net growth of the population superceded losses from turbulent diffusion, sinking and zooplankton grazing. Light climate strongly influenced net rates of growth of the DCM assemblage and its position; surface blooms of cyanobacteria could obliterate the DCM by shading cells and suppressing light available for their growth. This finding has important implications for eutrophication of lakes with DCMs, as relatively small changes in surface phytoplankton communities, for example through additional nutrient inputs, could obliterate the DCM. The relevance of the diatom DCM phytoplankton is that it has important ecosystem-level effects through sedimentation of nutrients and organic matter, and transfer of biomass to higher trophic levels resulting from preferential grazing.  Further examination of DCM communities was carried out in Lake Tikitapu, a small lake in the Rotorua basin. The DCM assemblage in this lake comprised dinoflagellate species. The DCM persisted over the period of thermal stratification, in the metalimnion, and also at a depth where irradiance was approximately 2-3 % of the surface value. Statistical analysis found that the light level at the DCM was more important than the depth of thermocline in determining the depth of the DCM. There was no evidence of diurnal vertical migration of the DCM in Lake Tikitapu, but dispersion of the DCM varied seasonally, whereby the width was strongly positively correlated to the width of the metalimnion. There was a biomass decrease in DCM populations that were incubated at high irradiance  suggesting that surface irradiances may be damaging or inhibitory to growth. For 40 lakes mixing regimes were divided into three classes; stable seasonal stratification, intermittent stratification and mixed, and trophic states were separated in oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic. In addition, average photosynthetically available radiation experienced by phytoplankton was determined based on integrated levels over the surface mixed layer, and values were divided into three regimes. MDS showed a clear separation of stratified from intermittently stratified and mixed lakes based on phytoplankton composition, and phytoplankton assemblages in stably stratified lakes were significantly different from those in intermittently stratified lakesand mixed lakes. However, results of ANOSIM indicated that trophic state was not a statistically significant factor influencing phytoplankton assemblage composition. Mixing regime therefore provided a more accurate predictor of summer phytoplankton composition than trophic state or light climate, as lakes of different trophic state but similar mixing regime had similar phytoplankton assemblages.

T1  - Evaluation of hatchery and growout factors for the successful production and stocking of juvenile Gulf coast walleye
AN  - 305446713
AB  - Temperature-dependent weight gain of Gulf coast and northern strain walleye  Sander vitreus fingerlings was determined by rearing fish in flow-through aquaria at different water temperatures (range 15-32°C). Maximum growth of Gulf coast and northern strain walleye occurred between 20 and 26°C, and weight gain of northern walleye exceeded that of the Gulf coast strain by 1.5 times. An acclimated chronic exposure method to assess upper thermal limits determined that walleye survived 35, 9, and 1 days at 33, 34, and 35°C, respectively. A post pond-rearing feed-training practice (21 d) at a mean density of 6,290 ± 1,247 fish/m3 using formulated feeds was successful (32-85% survival), and walleye continued to consume a formulated diet feed after stocked at densities of 12,250 and 24,700/ha into 0.04 ha earthen ponds. After 125 days, survival in ponds was poor (< 30%) and production varied substantially.

T1  - Structural and functional analysis of p26, a small heat shock protein from <i>Artemia franciscana</i>
AN  - 305375727
AB  - The brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, undergoes encystment and diapause, exhibiting a remarkable resistance to environmental stresses during this time. Encysted Artemia embryos contain an abundant small heat shock protein termed p26, a molecular chaperone contributing to development and survival. To investigate the role of p26 during  Artemia development and upon exposure to stress, the structural and functional characteristics of wild type and modified p26 were determined. Wild type p26 resided predominantly in the cytoplasm of transiently transfected COS-1 cells, however mutated p26 occurred in both cytoplasm and nuclei. Translocation into nuclei was especially evident for variants missing the complete amino-terminal region, a single site mutant R114A, and a multiple-arginine-deleted mutant “R”. When produced in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, modified p26 lacking the amino-terminal region occurred mainly as monomers and dimers, indicating the relevance of the amino-terminus for p26 oligomer formation. Assembly of higher order oligomers was strengthened by the carboxy-terminal extension, although removing the ten carboxy-terminal residues had only a marginal effect on oligomerization. A mechanism whereby oligomer disassembly assists translocation of p26 from cytoplasm into nuclei was suggested, this of importance because p26 translocates into Artemia embryo nuclei upon exposure to anoxia and thermal shock. However, when examined in Artemia, the results suggested a process more complex than just oligomer dissociation for regulation of p26 nuclear translocation. Bacterial thermotolerance and protein chaperoning assays demonstrated that modified p26 had decreased chaperoning capability, with truncated variants, mutant R114A and mutant “R” most dramatically affected. Oligomerization is necessary but not sufficient for full chaperone activity, since mutant R114A formed large oligomers while exhibiting limited chaperone capability. Circular dichroism revealed that secondary structures of most mutants, in comparison with wild type p26, possessed increased α-helices and decreased β-conformations. Intrinsic fluorescence and ANS-binding studies demonstrated altered aromatic residue microenvironments and reduced global hydrophobicity for p26 variants. Comparative modeling indicated the p26 α-crystallin domain is arranged in an immunoglobulin-like fold as a β-sandwich consisting of eight β-strands forming two antiparallel β-sheets. This work, which has important implications for understanding the relationship between p26 structural organization and functional mechanisms during  Artemia development and stress, provides a model for study of other small heat shock proteins. As such, it may lead to a better appreciation of diseases, including ischemia/reperfusion injury, cataract, desmin-related myopathy and neurodegenerative disorders.

T1  - A miokardium intracelluláris kalcium homeosztázisa: Iszkémiás és kardiomiopátiás változások
AN  - 305370850
AB  - Cardiac contractility is dependent upon the precise regulation of intracellular Ca2+i cycling, i.e. the Ca2+ i transient. In the present study disturbances of Ca2+ i handling in ischemic/reperfused heart after heat shock (HS) treatment and in doxorubicin (DOX) induced cardiomyopathy have been studied.    Over the past two decades, numerous studies have shown that HS preconditioning enhances the tolerance of the heart against ischemia/reperfusion insult. One of the features of ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiac injury is the persistent increase of intracellular free Ca2+ level. Experimental data on Ca2+i handling in the ischemic/reperfused heart after HS treatment are, however, scarce. The available information mainly pertains alterations in SR calcium uptake and is contradictory. No experimental data regarding HS preconditioning and Ca2+i handling during ischemia/reperfusion have been obtained in isolated cardiomyocytes or perfused heart preparations, hence one of the main aims of the present study was, therefore, to determine the effect of in vivo HS pretreatment on Ca2+i handling in the intact ischemic/reperfused rat heart in relation to contractile performance and to disclose the nature of the alterations in Ca2+ release and sequestration processes, if there is.    Development of cardiomyopathy is multifactorial. However, it appears that oxidative and nitrosative stress---such as induced by DOX---plays a clear role in this process. Doxorubicin undergoes redox cycling to generate free radicals that are responsible for mediating the various cytopathologies associated. One of the more recently identified pathways of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is related to poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation. When activated by DNA single-strand breaks, PARP initiates an energy consuming cycle slowing the rate of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration eventually leading to cellular dysfunction and death. Very little is known however how these processes affect Ca2+i handling of the cardiomyocyte, prompting the secondary aim of the present study.    In the first part of our study we have shown for the first time in intact hearts "in vitro" that heat shock pretreatment prevents a further increase in end-diastolic Ca2+i after an ischemia/reperfusion insult and, hence, mitigates post-ischemic calcium overload. Our results also suggest that improved postischemic myocardial performance in response to HS pretreatment is at least partly due to a relatively preserved sensitivity of the myocardial contractile machinery towards Ca2+. However, delineation of the precise mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomena needs further experimental work.    In the second part of this study we made the following observations (1) demonstration of an increase in end-diastolic calcium levels in doxorubicin-treated hearts; (2) development of a decline in calcium sensitivity of the contractile machinery in the diseased hearts; (3) the enhanced susceptibility of the doxorubicin-treated hearts towards a subsequent acute oxidative stress and (4) the protective effects of PARP inhibitor, strongly suggesting that activation of the nuclear enzyme PARP is involved in the functional alterations of the doxorubicin-treated heart. Overall, the results of the current study are consistent with the notion that reactive oxidant species and the PARP pathway play a pathogenetic role in the development of doxorubicin induced cardiac dysfunction. Normalization of cellular calcium handling appears to be an additional mode of the cardio protective effects of PARP inhibitors.

T1  - Effect of cold acclimation on neuromuscular function of the hand
AN  - 305360226
AB  - The present research was developed to investigate the effects of cold stress on neuromuscular function with the main focus on cold acclimation. In total six studies; one field study and five experiments were conducted. The field study showed that during manual work in cold weather, finger and hand temperature can drop to levels that may impair manual function. The first two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of acute local cold stress on force control and to investigate the effect of cold-induced vasodilatation (CIVD) on neuromuscular function. In Experiment 1, it was found that cooling of the hand in 10°C cold water for 10 min did not improve force control although neuromuscular function was significantly impaired after cooling. In the second experiment, cold-induced vasodilatation, occurring after 20 min of 8°C cold water immersion of the hand, was confined to the finger tip and it had no effect on the temperature of the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle or its neuromuscular function.   A series of cold acclimation studies was conducted to investigate the effect of repeated cold water hand immersions on neuromuscular function. In these experiments, neuromuscular function was tested before and after 2 to 3 weeks of daily hand immersion in 8°C cold water for 30 min. In Experiment 3 it was found that 3 weeks of cold water immersion resulted in a decrease in minimum and mean index finger temperature and CIVD was attenuated. Neuromuscular function was not affected by this change in temperature response. In Experiment 4, one hand was exposed daily to cold water and compared to the opposite control hand. Blood plasma catecholamine concentrations were increased after 2 weeks in the cold exposed hand but no changes in temperature response or neuromuscular function were found after repeated cold exposure. Thermal comfort after 30 min of cold water immersion significantly improved after repeated cold exposure causing a discrepancy between actual and perceived temperature and it was suggested that this may impose a greater risk of cold injury due to a change in behavioural thermoregulation. In the last experiment, core temperature was elevated by bicycling at a submaximal level during the cold hand immersion. Exercise had a direct effect on the temperature response during cold water immersion decreasing the minimum FDI temperature and slowing down the deteriorating effect of cold on neuromuscular function, but there was no effect of exercise on the local cold acclimation. It is concluded that local repeated cold exposures may improve finger and hand temperature and subjective thermal ratings, but the changes are too small to improve neuromuscular function. The best remedy to maintain manual function is to limit or avoid cold stress as much as possible. If sufficient protection of the hands is impossible, core heating through exercise or passive heating may be a solution.

T1  - The nature of thermal tolerance in the western mosquitofish, <i>Gambusia affinis</i>, exposed to heated effluents
AN  - 305356367
AB  - Gambusia affinis (Baud and Girard), the Western Mosquito fish, a live-bearing species native to the southern United States, is one of the most widespread, introduced species in the world and has a wide thermal tolerance range, surviving 8°C to 40°C. High heat tolerance allows this species to inhabit thermal effluents of power stations where temperatures approach and often exceed its upper thermal limit. Thus, artificially induced natural selection may act on these populations, allowing only thermally tolerant individuals to survive during summer months. Potential influences on thermal tolerance in G. affinis are examined here, including thermal history, dispersal, and the possibility of natural selection on a population of mosquitofish inhabiting the thermal effluent of a power station in Texas. Natural selection is a syllogism with three main components necessary and sufficient for operation: variation among individuals in some phenotypic trait, heritability of that trait, and fitness differences associated with the trait. Thermal tolerance estimates for heated-effluent mosquitofish were 0.6–1.0°C higher than the main-reservoir population after both were acclimated to constant temperature. Second-generation offspring retained ancestral thermal tolerance levels and heritability was estimated to be 69.7% by regression of mid-parent with mean offspring thermal tolerance. Fitness differences were suggested by measuring mortality over time while holding thermally sensitive and thermally tolerant mosquitofish in enclosures within the heated effluent during mid-summer. Although reproduction was also monitored, no reproduction occurred. Yet, approximately half of the heated-effluent mosquitofish survived when all main-reservoir mosquitofish perished. Evidence was provided that mosquitofish avoid mid-summer temperatures by dispersing into cooler waters within stands of emergent vegetation along the margins of the heated effluent rather than downstream toward the main reservoir. Additionally, thermal history, within the lifetimes of individuals, was found to influence adult thermal tolerance. Exposure temperature change during development was associated with a corresponding change in adult thermal tolerance: mosquitofish exposed to increasing temperatures during development tended to have higher thermal tolerance, while those exposed to decreasing temperatures had lower thermal tolerance. Thus, although environmental factors influence thermal tolerance, all three components required of natural selection were present in this population, strongly suggesting local adaptation of a thermally tolerant race.

T1  - Seawater adaptation in juvenile green sturgeon, <i>Acipenser medirostris</i>
AN  - 305031583
AB  - Aspects of the seawater (SW) adaptation of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), an anadromous species along the Pacific Coast of North America, were examined. In their natal rivers, temperatures have changed from historic patterns. To determine the effect of elevated and cycling temperature regimes on post yolk-sac larva to early juveniles, growth rates were measured. Significant differences were found between final wet weights, total lengths (TL), and specific growth rates (24°C & cycling 19--24°C > 19°C), indicating that these temperatures do not adversely affect juveniles (∼0.1--10 g) with abundant food and oxygen. Because some salmonids show decreased swimming performance ( Ucrit) during their parr-smolt transformation, we tested the hypothesis that juvenile green sturgeon decrease U crit during their analogous ontogenetic stage. U crit increased up until the size that SW tolerance was achieved, and then either decreased or increased depending on the season. Therefore, ontogenetic and endogenous factors appear to influence swimming abilities. A salinity tolerance study was conducted to determine the earliest age/size at which SW survival was possible for short-term (72-h) and long-term (28-d) exposure. Juvenile green sturgeon salinity tolerance increased with increasing size and age, with 100% survival in 72-h exposed fish occurring by 134 days post-hatch (dph; 86 g, 266 mm TL), and 100% survival in 28-d exposed fish by 7 months in two size groups (139 g, 336 mm TL; 342 g, 434 mm TL). To determine the metabolic costs and osmoregulatory mechanisms involved in SW adaptation, sturgeon (100, 170, and 533 dph) were acclimated to salinities of <3‰, 10‰, and 33‰. There were no differences in body-mass-adjusted oxygen consumption rates, and osmo- and ionoregulatory abilities were comparable among <3‰ and 10‰ groups, and with the 533 dph 33‰ group. Na+, K+-ATPase activities increased in pyloric caeca at 33‰, presumably due to drinking and SW absorption. Gill chloride cell size increased between 100 and 170 dph, and abundance relative to wet mass decreased with increasing age/size. These results indicated an age/body size effect in hyperosmotic adaptability, and that juvenile green sturgeon most likely enter SW by 1.5 kg (75 cm TL).

T1  - An evolutionary genetic analysis of metabolic pathways and physiological performance in <i>Drosophila</i>
AN  - 305016193
AB  - Physiological performance is central to the connection between genetic variation and variation in fitness. Genes and their protein products are imbedded within regulatory and biochemical networks. Genetic variants impact whole-organism physiological performance through alteration of these networks. Many perturbations of physiological performance will ultimately impact survival and/or reproduction. Considering this causal chain in reverse, natural selection will shape genetic variation within the biochemical pathways and regulatory networks underlying physiological performance. The evolution of physiological performance depends on the genetic architecture of the underlying pathways and the relationship between genetic variation within these pathways, performance and fitness. Here I report an evolutionary genetic analysis of two traits that challenge energy metabolism in Drosophila: flight and the detoxification of environmental toxins.    A mapping study revealed quantitative trait loci for metabolic enzyme activities, metabolite storage, metabolic rate and flight performance in  D. melanogaster. Trans-acting genomic regions were an important source of variation in glycolytic enzyme activities. Epistasis affected enzyme activities, metabolite storage, respiration and flight. I identified a genomic region that potentially co-regulates enzymes flanking a glycolytic branchpoint with effects on organismal performance.    An analysis of ethanol and acetic acid tolerance in D. melanogaster  under different temperature treatments revealed that biochemical pathways interact with cellular processes to determine physiological performance. Rearing temperature and population differences in ethanol tolerance were consistent with changes in gene expression and enzyme activities within the biochemical detoxification pathway. Temperature acclimation, as well as rapid temperature shifts, affected tolerance in a manner consistent with predictions based on membrane fluidity and the regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis. These results have implications for understanding the genetic-physiological-ecological basis for the evolution of toxin tolerance in Drosophila.    Lastly I introduce an approach to modeling ethanol tolerance and flight performance as functions of flux through biochemical pathways using enzyme activity measures. I derived equations describing steady-state flux through the linear ethanol detoxification pathway and through the glucose-6-phosphate branchpoint in glycolysis. I describe a Bayesian method for searching the high dimensional parameter space. This approach is beginning to shed light on the contribution of genetic variation in metabolic pathways to variation in organismal performance in Drosophila.

T1  - Thermal acclimation processes in the grain aphid sitobion avenae (hemiptera: aphididae): characterising the effect of rapid cold hardening and seasonal acclimation on survival and movement thresholds at low temperature
AN  - 301663003
AB  - The ability of nymphs and adults of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae to rapidly cold harden and to increase cold hardiness through successive generations reared at low temperature was investigated.  Rapid cold hardening increased survival at -8°C from 20% to 80% and extended the lower lethal temperature by 3°C.  No ecological costs in terms of development, longevity or fecundity were associated with RCH.  'Seasonally' acclimating aphids by rearing at 10°C for >6 months, increased the RCH ability of aphids, and the combination of seasonal acclimation and RCH actually enhanced fitness.  The ability of this species to rapidly cold harden provides a significant survival advantage, allowing the cold hardiness of individuals to track daily changes in temperature.
  The short generation times of aphids mean that developing embryos are subject to the same environmental temperatures as their mother.  Because of this so-called 'telescoping of generations', the cold hardiness of new-born nymphs is a function of both pre- and post-natal environmental temperatures.  Rearing aphids at 10°C extended the lower lethal temperature of the population by 3°C compared to aphids reared at 20°C.  Nymphs were consistently more cold hardy than adults, with first born nymphs exhibiting greater cold hardiness than those born later in the mothers reproductive life, suggesting that low temperature exerts an intergenerational selection for increased cold tolerance, combined with a preferential investment of increased cold tolerance in first born progeny through successive generations.  
  The role of rapid and intergenerational cold hardening in the overwintering ability of Sitobion avenae are discussed with reference to the implications of global warming and the importance of this aphid as a vector of barley yellow dwarf virus.

T1  - RESPONSES OF FLESH FLY (BOETTCHERISCA PEREGRINA) TO HEAVY METALS AND ITS ADAPTATION MECHANISM
TT  - 棕尾别麻蝇对重金属的反应及适应机制的研究
AN  - 1027045946
AB  - There is a growing public concern over the potential pollution of heavy metals in China owing to rapid urban and industrial development in the last several decades. Heavy metals are nonbiodegradable and they can be accumulated by organisms and have adverse effects at different levels of organization, such as population, individual organisms, tissues and cells. These effects are demonstrated in life-history traits of an organisms, for example, development, growth, aging, longevity, survival and reproduction. In the ecosystems insects (such as flies, mosquitoes, beetles and ants) play an important role in the transport and reintegration of heavy metals, and the insects have developed special adaptation mechanism to resist the heavy metal under the metal-pollution stress. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to investigate heavy metal accumulation in such insects, effects on the insects and adaptation mechanism of the insects. In this paper, the accumulation, the responses, homeostasis and storage mechanism of flesh fly (Biettcherisca peregrina) to Cd2+ and Cu2+ are studied. The results are shown as follows:
1 Effects of Cd2+ and Cu2+ on development and reproduction of parental generation (P) and filial generation (F1) of Biettcherisca peregrina
The development and reproduction of P generation and F1 generation of B. peregrina were studied after newly oviposited larvae of P generation were exposed to various concentrations of Cd2+ or Cu2+ administered in the artificial diet until pupation. The duration of the larval stages and pupal stages in P generation increased in proportion to the concentrations of metal ion, but the adult lives of treated-group got shortened than control group. The weight of larvae, pupae and newly emerged adults in P generation of treated-group decreased with Cd2+ or Cu2+ concentration. In addition, the body length of larvae and pupae in P generation of treated-group decreased with Cd2+ or Cu2+ concentration too. Survival of larvae, pupae and adult in P generation of treated-group was decreased with metal concentration. Although the sex ratio of adult coming from the larvae exposed to Cd2+ or Cu2+ had no significance compared with the control, mating rate of male and female were significantly lower than controls. Fecundity of females of treated groups was also significantly reduced. However, all above parameters of F1 generation coming from parents exposed to Cd2+ or Cu2+ and controls were not significantly different. These results show that development and reproduction of P generation are seriously impaired at sublethal Cd2+ or Cu2+ concentrations, but the impairment of P generation induced by Cd2+ or Cu2+ don’t influence the development and reproduction of the offspring. Moreover, low concentrations of heavy metals affected little to the development of B. peregrina and have stimulatory function to some extent, implying that B. peregrina has good mechanism to regulate metals.
2 Accumulation and excretion of Cd2+ and Cu2+ in Biettcherisca peregrina larvae
B. peregrina larvae fed on food supplemented with Cd2+ retained most of ingested Cd2+. Few ingested Cd2+ were excreted by excretory system. Cd2+ accumulation in larvae of B. peregrina was proportional to treatment time, but not to Cd2+ concentration in food. Especially, Cd2+ accumulation and excretion in larvae both decreased at more than 200 μg/g Cd2+ exposure than 200 μg/g exposure. This maybe ascribe to toxic effect of Cd2+ on larvae. During metamorphosis, the loss of Cd2+ took place almost entirely at pupation. Newly eclosion adults had lower Cd2+ concents than the larvae. This loss of Cd2+ was correlated to the excretion of Cd2+.
B. peregrina larvae fed on food supplemented with Cu2+ retained about half amounts of ingested Cu2+. Few ingested Cu2+ were excreted by excretory system. Cu2+ accumulation and excretion in larvae of B. peregrina were proportional to treatment time and to Cu2+ concentration in food. During metamorphosis, Cu2+ was excreted by final instar larvae and newly eclosion adults and Cu2+ content in vivo decresed.
3 The distribution of Cd2+ and Cu2+ among tissues of Biettcherisca peregrina larvae
The larvae of B. peregrina were fed with Cd2+-containing or Cu2+-containing diet and the distributions of Cd2+ and Cu2+ among tissues were determined by separating each organ. The results determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer showed most of Cd2+ and Cu2+ accumulated in the alimentary canal, especially midgut, and the content of Cu2+ and Cd2+ in integument, fat body, haemolymph and malpighian tubules were very low. But the concentrations of heavy metal in malpighian tubules was adjacent to that in midgut, and was much higher than that in integument, fat body and haemolymph.
4 Morphological and ultrastructural alternations in the midgut and malpighian tubules after the Cd2+ and Cu2+ exposure
The effects of Cd2+ (80 μg/g) and Cu2+ (100 μg/g) on the morphology and ultrastructure of midgut and malpighian tubules of B. peregrina larvae were studied by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Treatment times (48 h) and metal concentrations were in the sublethal range to the larvae as determined by toxicity test. Under the treatment time and metal concentrations, the two metal species had profound effects on the morphology and ultra- structure of midgut and malpighian tubules. The morphology of midgut and malpighian tubules in treatment showed similar changes at the light microscopical level: the midgut got darker, shorter and thicker than control midgut, and many strumaes occurred on the surface of the midgut; and the malpighian tubules got shorter and thinner. Ultrastructural alterations in midgut induced by Cu2+ and Cd2+ included mitochondrial condensation, swelling, and lysis. The rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) showed dilation and vesiculation. The microvilli (MV) were shortened and disordered. The lipid droplets decreased and stored glycogens were increased. Many mineral spherites appeared. Ultrastructural alterations observed in the malpighian tubules included rER vesiculation and mito- chondria swelling with loss of cristae. Shortened and disordered microvilli, increased numbers of large hydropic vacuoles and mineral spherites were also observed. It was special to malpighian tubules basal membrane became thinner.
5 Effects of Cd2+ and Cu2+ on the number, spreading and viability of the larval hemocytes
we investigated the effects of Cd2+ and Cu2+ on hemocytes of B. peregrina in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, the total number of hemocytes and viability of hemocytes decreased after the larvae fed cadmium-containing and copper-containing diets in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In vitro , Haemocytes from 4th-day-old larvae were seeded in 96-well microplates and exposed to Cd2+ or Cu2+ at the concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, 20 and 40 μg/g. The viability of hemocytes was affected by heavy metals in a dose- dependent manner, and the viability ratio is no difference after 0.5 h and 4 h incubation. Moreover, the spreading had no difference among metal-exposed hemocytes and control hemocytes. The above results indicated Cd2+ or Cu2+ can disturb hemocytes of B. peregrina.
6 Changes of energy level in larval haemolymph on exposure of larvae to Cd2+ and Cu2+
The biochemical constituents of larval haemolymph such as total sugar, proteins ans lipids were determined in B. peregrina larvae to Cd2+ or Cu2+ at different concentrations for 48 h, repectively. The results showed the biochemical constituents decresed on exposure to Cd2+ and Cu2+, and the energy level determined by the biochemical constituents decreased too. Moreover, high concentrations were found to more effective than low concentration. The effect of Cd2+ or Cu2+ at the concentration of 800 μg/g was also studied on the above biochemical consitituents at intervals of 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h. The results showed biochemical constituents and energy level in Cd2+- or Cu2+-exposed larvae were lower than that in control larvae. Therefore, measuring the caloric concentration in larval haemolymph of B. peregrina can be used to evalute the physiological effects of combating Cd2+ and Cu2+ toxicity.
7 Lipid peroxidation induced by Cd2+ and Cu2+ in Biettcherisca peregrina larvae
Cd2+ and Cu2+ could induce the increasing of lipid peroxidation in B. peregrina larvae in dose-dependent and time-dependent ways.
8 Isolation, purification and characterization of metallothioein
The metallothioneins (MT) in B. peregrina larvae were induced to be produced after feeding the dietary containing 800 μg cadmium per gram diet for 48 h. Two forms of MTs (MT-I and MT-II) were isolated and purified from the supernatant of the whole body homogenates from the larvae after exposure to cadmium chlorides, using gel chromatography on Sephadex G-50, ion-exchange chromatography on UNOTM Q1, and on Bio-Gel P-6 for desalination. Both molecular weights of MT-I and MT-II were 9 kDa. Both MT-I and MT-II contained 7 cadmium atoms and 20 sulfhydryl groups per molecule, and showed the spectral characteristic of cadmium-thionein, i.e. a broad shoulder at 254 nm. As to amino acid composition of MT-I and MT-II, their contents of cysteine residues were the highest, accounting for 36.6% and 31.8% of all amino acids, respectively. However, their contents of aromatic amino acid and histidine were very low, just sharing 1%~2% of all amino acids.
9 Proteomic analysis of Responses to Cd2+ in the midgut of Biettcherisca peregrina
We examined proteome changes of midgut cells in a B. peregrina larvae to acute cadmium stress using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The expression levels of many protein spots showed changes. Amounts of fourteen proteins increased and of ten proteins decreased. Of these fourteen increased protein, ten protein were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationtime of flight mass spectrometry, and 7 proteins have previously been reported to be relevant to cellular detoxification processes. The functions of 7 proteins include the removal of Cd (p -glycoprotein，pGp)，emergency function (Heat shock proteins, Hsp ), osmoregulation and transport metal ion (cadmium-inducible lysosomal protein CDR). 
10. Comparison of metal accumulation, growth and development, reproduction and antioxidant enzymes in resistant strain and susceptible strain
Development of cadmium tolerance and copper tolerance in a natural B. peregrina population maintained in the laboratory for 20 generations. Increased metal tolerance in selected strains (RCd and RCu) was reflected by increased metal accumulation, enhanced juvenile survivorship, and increased fecundity of female adult compared with the relative susceptible strain (S). The RCd and RCu strains displaied higher metallothionein levels than S strain after inducement with same level of heavy metals. This correlated with increased metal accumulation. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione- S-transferase (GST) and esterase (EST) were measured after the larvae of different srains were exposed to heavy metal. Significant enhancement of GR activity were observed in RCd and RCu strains compared with S strain, while SOD, CAT, GST and EST levels were not significantly different.Alternate abstract:城市和现代工业的飞速发展带来了许多环境问题，其中重金属污染被越来越多的人们所关注。因重金属不能降解，且能够在生物体内积累并在不同的生物学水平（如种群、个体、组织和细胞）产生不利影响。这些影响涉及到生物的生长发育、寿命、存活和繁殖等方面。在生态系统中，昆虫 (如蝇类、蚊子、甲虫和蚂蚁等) 在金属的转移和再利用方面起了重要作用，且它们在金属污染的胁迫下已经发展了特殊的适应机制。因此，研究重金属在昆虫体内的累积、代谢及昆虫对重金属的适应是非常有意义的。本论文就棕尾别麻蝇Boettcherisca（Sarcophaga）peregrina（双翅目: 麻蝇科）对重金属镉（Cd）和铜（Cu）的积累、反应、内稳态调控和贮存机制作了研究。主要结果概括如下：
1 Cd2+ 与Cu2+ 对亲代和子代生长发育和繁殖的影响
棕尾别麻蝇亲代初产幼虫取食含有不同浓度Cd2+ 或Cu2+ 的饲料，发育受到显著影响。如幼虫各龄期和蛹期随金属离子浓度的升高而延长，成虫寿命随着浓度的升高而缩短；幼虫、蛹和新羽化成虫的重量、幼虫体长和蛹长均低于对照；幼虫、蛹和成虫的存活率随金属离子浓度的升高而降低；虽然经Cd2+ 或 Cu2+ 处理后成虫性比与对照没有显著差异，但雌雄交配率与对照相比明显降低，雌蝇生殖力也明显下降。然而，Cd2+ 或 Cu2+ 处理亲代的子一代的发育和对照子一代相比并无显著差异。这些结果表明经Cd2+ 或Cu2+ 处理后当代试虫的生长发育及生殖受到严重的损害，但此损害没有影响到后代的生长发育和繁殖。另外，低浓度的Cd2+ 和Cu2+ 对棕尾别麻蝇的生长发育影响不大，在某些方面还有一定的刺激作用，这暗示着棕尾别麻蝇体内存在着有效的重金属调控机制。
2 Cd2+ 与 Cu2+ 在幼虫体内的积累和排泄
棕尾别麻蝇幼虫连续取食含有Cd2+ 的饲料后，大部分Cd2+ 连续积累在体内，少部分通过排泄系统排出。在幼虫体内的积累量与处理时间成比例，但与食物中金属离子的浓度不成比例。但处理浓度超过200 μg/g时，积累量和排泄量都比200 μg/g处理显著降低，这可能由于高浓度的Cd2+ 使幼虫中毒有关。在变态过程中，蛹的Cd2+ 含量比幼虫的低，刚羽化成虫的Cd2+ 含量比蛹的低。这都与Cd2+ 的排泄相关。
棕尾别麻蝇幼虫取食含Cu2+ 的饲料后，Cu2+ 的积累量和排泄量大体相当，随着处理时间的延长，不断在体内积累，而且积累量和排泄量基本上与处理的Cu2+ 浓度成比例。在变态过程中，Cu2+ 也不断被排泄，体内Cu2+ 含量随之下降。
3 Cd2+ 与 Cu2+ 在幼虫组织中的累积分布
   棕尾别麻蝇幼虫取食含Cd2+ 和 Cu2+ 的食物后，Cd2+ 和 Cu2+ 主要积累在幼虫的消化道，特别是中肠。在表皮、脂肪体、血淋巴和马氏管中的Cd2+ 和 Cu2+ 含量很低，但是就器官中的Cd2+ 和 Cu2+ 浓度而言，马氏管与中肠接近，甚至更高，且马氏管与中肠中的浓度都远远高于表皮、脂肪体和血淋巴中的浓度。
4 Cd2+ 与 Cu2+ 对幼虫中肠及马氏管超微结构的影响
两种金属对中肠和马氏管的形态及超微结构都有明显的影响。中肠和马氏管的形态在光学显微水平下有相似的变化：与对照相比，中肠色泽变深，长度变短，壁变薄，且在中肠的表面出现了许多瘤状突起；马氏管也相应地变得短而薄。在Cu2+ 和Cd2+ 的诱导下，中肠的超微结构改变包括了线粒体浓缩，肿胀和消失。粗面内质网（rER）变得膨胀和空泡化。微绒毛（MV）变短和无序。脂滴数量下降，贮存的糖元量上升。出现了许多矿物颗粒体。马氏管超微结构的改变包括rER的空泡化和线粒体的肿胀及嵴的缺失，微绒毛排列无序且缩短，出现了大量液泡水肿及矿物颗粒体，基膜明显变薄。
5 Cd2+ 与 Cu2+ 对幼虫血细胞的数量、存活和延展的影响
活体测定结果表明，在幼虫取食含有Cd2+ 或Cu2+ 食物后血细胞的总数和血细胞的存活率下降，且下降的程度与金属剂量和处理时间有关。离体测定结果表明，重金属对4日龄幼虫的血细胞的存活有显著影响，且具有浓度依赖效应，而Cd2+ 或Cu2+ 处理对血细胞的延展无显著影响。
6 Cd2+ 与 Cu2+  对幼虫血淋巴能量水平的影响 
棕尾别麻蝇幼虫分别取食含100、200、400、800 μg/g Cd2+ 或Cu2+ 的食物48 h后血淋巴中糖、脂类和蛋白的浓度降低，由这些化合物决定的能量水平也降低，且这种降低受Cd2+ 和 Cu2+ 浓度的影响。幼虫接触800 μg/g Cd2+ 或Cu2+ 24、48、72、96 和120 h后，幼虫的血淋巴化学组成和能量水平都比相应的对照幼虫的低。
7 Cd2+ 与 Cu2+ 对幼虫脂质过氧化作用的影响
镉和铜可以诱导幼虫体内的脂质过氧化作用的显著增强，且这种作用存在浓度效应和时间效应。
8 金属硫蛋白的分离纯化及性质分析
棕尾别麻蝇幼虫取食含800 μg/g Cd2+ 的食物48 h 后，可诱导金属硫蛋白 (MT)的合成。诱导处理后的幼虫匀浆上清液经Sephadex G-50分子筛柱、UNOTM Q1阴离子交换柱 和 Bio-Gel P-6 脱盐柱层析，纯化得到2个MT亚型，即MT-I和MT-Ⅱ。MT-I和MT-Ⅱ的分子量为9 kDa，每蛋白分子均含7个Cd和20个巯基，且具254 nm的Cd-SH特征吸收肩。两者的氨基酸组成中，以半胱氨酸含量最高，各为36.6%和31.8%，而芳香族氨基酸和组氨酸含量甚少，约1% ~ 2%。
9 幼虫中肠对Cd2+ 反应的蛋白质组分析
通过双向电泳检测棕尾别麻蝇幼虫取食急性浓度的Cd2+ 后中肠细胞的蛋白质组变化。结果表明，有14个蛋白表达量增加，11个蛋白表达量减少。在蛋白量增加的14个蛋白中，通过肽指纹（PMF）和基质辅助激光解析离子飞行时间质谱（MALDI-TOF-MS）对其中10个点进行了鉴定。其中7个高覆盖率蛋白可能与Cd2+ 的细胞内解毒有关, 它们的功能包括移动并调控Cd2+ (p-糖蛋白，p-glycoprotein，pGp)、应急功能（热激蛋白，Heat shock proteins, Hsp）、渗透调节和转运金属离子（Cd诱导的溶酶体蛋白CDR-5, cadmium-inducible lysosomal protein CDR）等。
10 耐性品系和敏感品系重金属积累、生长发育、繁殖及抗氧化酶活力的比较
用镉和铜分别连续筛选棕尾别麻蝇20代获得耐Cd品系（RCd） 和耐Cu品系（RCu）。与相对敏感品系（S）相比，RCd 品系和RCu 品系幼虫积累Cd2+ 或Cu2+ 的量增加，存活率升高；成虫生殖力增加，这证明其对重金属的耐性增强。相同水平的Cd2+ 诱导，RCd品系幼虫的MT表达量高于S品系幼虫的MT表达量，相同水平的Cu2+ 诱导，RCu品系幼虫的MT表达量高于S品系幼虫的MT表达量。RCd 和 RCu 两品系幼虫的谷胱甘肽还原酶（GR）酶活性显著高于S品系幼虫的GR酶活性，而超氧化物歧化酶（SOD）、过氧化氢酶（CAT）、谷胱甘肽-S-转移酶（GST）和 酯酶（EST）酶活性在品系间无显著差异。

T1  - Effects of hypoxia, anoxia and acidosis on the ECG and cardiac force development of the freshwater turtle
AN  - 305219197
AB  - Previous studies have shown that anoxia and acidosis decrease cardiac contractile force and cardiac power output in the freshwater turtle. We sought to define the thresholds for responses to anoxia and acidosis in isolated ventricular strips of the painted turtle and soft shell turtle and in the whole turtle. We defined the cardiovascular responses to hypoxia in whole turtle via exposure to graded hypoxia at 20°C using inspired gas levels of 21%, 10%, 5%, 2.5% and 0% O2. We also investigated the effects of KCL, atropine, propranalol, and cold temperature (5°C) on the cardiac function and metabolism of intact turtles. For whole animal experiments we used ECG and normalized interbeat variability to quantify arrhythmia and to document the maintenance of cardiac electrical activity. Our results demonstrated: (1) cardiac tolerance to hypoxia was similar in anoxia tolerant turtles (western painted turtles) and anoxia intolerant turtles (soft shell turtles), suggesting that integrated regulatory responses may be dominant in determining in vivo tolerance. (2) Cardiac function is relatively well maintained in hypoxia/anoxia and in acidosis, but it is severely affected by combination. (3) In vivo cardiac mechanical function is reduced (rate and developed pressure) by anoxia but the hearts can continue to function for long periods in this state. (4) Anoxia affects electrical activity of the heart, both by increasing normalized interbeat variability and by causing various abnormalities of the ECG at various temperatures. (5) Hyperkalemia causes ECG irregularities but has no affect on normalized interbeat variability or total body metabolism. (6) Anoxic bradycardia is only slightly vagally mediated.

T1  - Elevated temperatures for insect management in mills: Biological, biochemical, and molecular responses of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> (Herbst)
AN  - 305173466
AB  - Methyl bromide, a fumigant traditionally used in mills for insect management, is an ozone depleter and may be phased out in the United States by 2005. The use of elevated temperatures, or heat treatment, is gaining popularity as a methyl bromide alternative. Heat treatment involves raising the ambient temperature of a flour mill to 50 to 60°C and holding these temperatures for 24 to 36 h. The purpose of this study was to characterize temperature profiles within a facility during heat treatment and to investigate stage-specific susceptibility, mechanisms of heat tolerance, and effects of elevated temperatures on reproduction in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), an economic pest commonly associated with flour mills in the United States.    Temperature profiles at 20 different locations in the Kansas State University pilot flour and feed mills subjected to heat treatment were described using nonlinear regressions. Mortality of eggs, young larvae, old larvae, pupae, and adults of T. castaneum exposed at these locations showed that temperatures ≥50°C were necessary for complete mortality. Time-mortality relationships at 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, and 60°C showed that young larvae were the most heat tolerant of all five life stages. It is hypothesized that heat shock proteins (HSP) may be involved in the thermotolerance observed. Western blotting using anti-bovine brain HSP 70 monoclonal antibody from mouse indicated that the expression of HSP 70 significantly increased by about 33% after the heat shock in young larvae. To understand the molecular basis of heat tolerance, three different cDNA fragments of heat shock proteins were developed by semi-nested PCR using degenerate primers. These three different  hsp70 genes were named as tchsp70 I, tchsc70 II, and tchsp III. Northern blotting and real-time quantitative PCR analyses suggested that tchsp70 I encoded a heat-inducible HSP, tchsc70 II a constitutively expressed HSP, and  tchsp70 III a developmentally regulated HSP in T. castaneum  that is over-expressed in young larvae.    The fecundity, fertility, and progeny production of T. castaneum  were adversely affected when exposed as pupae and adults to 50°C for ≤60 min. The quantitative information generated in this study will aid in effective management of T. castaneum in flour mills subjected to heat treatments.

T1  - Social development and conflict in the North American bumblebee <i>Bombus impatiens</i> Cresson
AN  - 305157614
AB  - Bumblebees are social insects, but the apparently cooperative relationship displayed between workers and queens is not a stable phenomenon. At some time in the colony cycle, cooperation breaks down, and conflict occurs, manifested in worker egg-laying, mutual egg eating, aggression, even in the death of the queen. Why this is so has long been a subject of study. Developments in greenhouse pollination by bumblebees have given the matter practical as well as theoretical implications.    Studies of one European species, Bombus terrestris, have suggested two principal explanatory hypotheses: (i) colony queens control worker reproductive behavior by pheromonal means, but lose their dominance over time, leading to conflict and worker egg-laying; (ii) workers cooperate with queens until they perceive it no longer in their kin-selected interests to do so, usually when eggs destined to be future reproductives, gynes or males, are developing in the colony.    I looked at free-flying and confined colonies of a North American species,  Bombus impatiens, and found that, although conflict did occur in the species, there was not a distinct competition phase in colony development. The physical manifestations of conflict differed from those in B. terrestris. Workers resisted egg-laying by their mother but did not appear to lay eggs themselves while she remained healthy. There was greater aggression in free-flying colonies, associated with egg cells primed with pollen by workers.    Competition was not correlated temporally with colony production of reproductives, nor did worker behavior suggest that fading queen pheromones released conflict. The non-cooperative behaviors of B. impatiens workers did not appear to be responses to changes affected by or occurring within the queen.    Colonies produced gynes before males. The timing of male production was normally distributed throughout the season. Limiting the pollen supplied to half the confined colonies did not change these facts, though it delayed the production of reproductives. Colonies of B. impatiens did not exhibit the population growth phase followed by reproductive phase suggested as optimal for annual social insects.    I monitored overwintering gynes, and determined seasonal supercooling points. B. impatiens in the Twin Cities appeared at the northern edge of the species temperature tolerance range.

T1  - Physiological ecology of native and invasive blue mussels (genus <i>Mytilus</i>) in central California
AN  - 305130224
AB  - Marine species invasions pose serious ecological and economic threats to coastal areas world-wide, however, we know little about why certain species are able to succeed in a novel habitat. In this study, I used congeners in the blue mussel species complex, Mytilus trossulus (non-invasive) and M. galloprovincialis (invasive from the Mediterranean), as a model system to address the role ecological physiology plays in determining which species succeed. It has been suggested that, within the California hybrid zone, the distribution of these species is dependent on salinity and temperature gradients and that salinity is the more important of the two physical variables. In this study, I focus on characterizing 8 sites in San Francisco and Monterey Bays by quantifying: (1) temperature and salinity variability, (2) adult distribution, and (3) recruitment patterns. The temperature and salinity characteristics of each site fall along an estuarine-oceanic gradient, with estuarine sites exhibiting greater temperature variability and lower salinity. Using genetic identification to map adult populations, I find that  M. trossulus increases in abundance as one moves up this estuarine gradient. Physiological tolerances of each species in response to acute temperature and salinity stress indicate that there is a characteristic break in heart activity during hyperthermal, hypothermal and hypohaline stress. Using acclimation mortality, hsp expression and heart activity parameters, it is clear that  M. trossulus is better suited to cooler conditions than the invasive  M. galloprovincialis and that the two species are equal in their tolerances to low salinity, arguing against the importance of salinity in driving adult distribution. Recruitment patterns indicate that there is great spatio-temporal variability in the seasonality and magnitude of recruitment events and that these patterns are site- and species-specific. The genetic techniques used here to differentiate among Mytilus genotypes are imperative for understanding species-level recruitment patterns, which has not been done in any other large-scale study on Mytilus recruitment. This work suggests that physiological tolerance may play a role in this species invasion but that it is at the larval or juvenile stage that physiological tolerance becomes important.

T1  - Development of novel substrates and sampling techniques for the analysis of drugs and model environmental pollutants via surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)
AN  - 305125834
AB  - Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) has shown promise for the analysis environmental and pharmaceutically relevant compounds due to its tremendous enhancement of Raman signals, and the large amount of structural information provided by the technique. Despite these advantages, SERS has not been established as a routine analytical tool due to limitations in the analytical figures of merit such as reproducibility and linear dynamic range. This is due in part to gross decomposition of sample analytes upon irradiation with the incident laser beam which significantly broaden and diminish the intensities of observed spectral bands. The primary goals in this project are to develop new substrates and sampling techniques to overcome the above mentioned problems. This work presents the use of a Sample Translation Technique (STT) as a means to minimize the thermal and photolytic effects commonly seen in SERS. The rapid spinning of the sample minimizes the effective residence time of analytes and substrate within the irradiated zone without reducing the spectral acquisition time or the density of analyte within the zone. The technique was studied by acquiring SERS spectra of various environmental and pharmaceutically relevant compounds such as Naproxen USP, riboflavin, folic acid, Rhodamine 6G, and 4-aminothiophenol using silver islands on glass and silver-polydimethylsiloxane composites as SERS substrates. In all cases, the collected spectra show improvements upon spinning at laser powers as low as 4.2 (±0.1) mW. Further studies with a series naphthalene, phenol, and benzoic acid derivatives as model environmental pollutants showed a considerable improvement in the reproducibility and the sensitivity of SERS. A linear dynamic range of at least two orders of magnitude with detection limits as low as 2.9 × 10−8 M and precision of less than ten percent relative standard deviation was also observed. The experiments show that different variables like pH and matrix composition can affect the sorption of the analyte onto the SERS substrate. The effect of these variables in the analysis of real samples is presented. The potential use of liquid chromatography for isolating the model pollutants from detrimental matrix components in natural waters is also shown.

T1  - Insect antifreeze proteins and the expression and characterization of spruce budworm isoforms in transgenic systems
AN  - 305116278
AB  - Antifreeze proteins (AFP) are important for freezing point depression in 2nd instar Choristonettra fumiferana, spruce budworm larvae. A total of 14 sequences encoding several AFP isoforms were cloned and characterized. The importance of specific residues in the structure and function of C. fumiferana AFP was assessed by examining closely related species. The sequences encoding the conserved β-helix region were subcloned from approximately one-third of the AFP genes from 3 sister budworm species. The aligned sequences show a high conservation of functional residues, including threonines in the ice-binding face and residues important for structure such as cysteine and seine. Divergence analysis dated the AFP gene duplication event to ∼4 million years ago, close to the beginning of recent glaciation events in North America.    In spruce budworm transcripts were highest in diapausing 2nd instars, but messages encoding some isoforms were also detected in eggs, 1 st instars, and in 6th instar gut tissue. Transcript levels did not appear to be affected by the tested temperatures or by altering the photoperiod, suggesting that AFP expression is developmentally regulated, and not influenced by environmental factors. Investigation of AFP transcript abundance in 6th instars showed low levels in gut tissue with AFP detected in gut contents and not in the hemolymph, as in diapausing instars. One novel isoform, Cf6, shows a high degree of sequence identity to a previously characterized isoform, Cf10, but has 2 adjacent disulfide bonds disrupted by mutations. Refolding of Cf6 and Cf10 from bacterial inclusion bodies show recoverable activity for only Cf10.    Heterologous expression systems were explored as a means to produce large quantities of individual AFP isoforms. Expression in Pichia yeast resulted in extensive glycosylation of the AFP, reducing the activity 99% when expressed in large-scale fermentors. Heterologous expression in transgenic  Drosophila gave better results with properly folded, active AFP secreted into the hemolymph. While variable AFP activity was observed between fly lines, the highest recorded value of 0.8°C thermal hysteresis did not confer cold tolerance to the flies at low non-freezing temperatures. Heterologous expression of several isoforms in Ori-DE3 E. coli bacteria resulted in low-level expression of soluble proteins that lacked AFP activity and were likely misfolded. Induction of several budworm AFPs in another  E. coli host strain, BL21-DE3, resulted in protein sequestration into inclusion bodies, resolublizing and refolding inclusion body protein was largely unsuccessful with only a fraction of the refolded protein staying soluble and having activity. This research has not only increased our understanding of these novel proteins, their evolution, their expression and their structure, but has also underscored the challenges of the study of highly folded, hyperactive antifreeze proteins.

T1  - Macroalgal distribution patterns and ecological performances in a tidal coastal lagoon, with emphasis on the non-indigenous <i>Codium fragile</i> ssp. <i>tomentosoides</i>
AN  - 305107064
AB  - Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides  is a North-West Pacific macroalgae that has invaded numerous lagoons. The success of C. fragile has been explained by its dispersal capacity, growth rate, nutrient uptake, salinity and temperature tolerances, and grazer resistance. I compared distribution, recruitment and growth of  Codium to native algae in Hog Island Bay, a shallow water lagoon in Virginia. To determine the extent of invaded habitats algae were mapped from 1998–02. Codium was fourth most abundant, and hence considered successful compared to most species in terms of its biomass.  Codium was found both unattached or attached to bivalve shells, while the majority of the dominant Gracilaria verrucosa and  Ulva curvata were incorporated into tube caps of the polychaete  Diopatra cuprea. Preference experiments showed that Diopatra  incorporated Ulva and Gracilaria most, Agardhiella subulata intermediate, and Codium  and Fucus vesiculosus least, and that the first 3 species were fragmented in the process. Thus, Diopatra facilitated Ulva and Gracilaria, by providing an abundant substrate, reducing flushing and maintaining a supply of fragments for regrowth. Tidal lagoons are characterized by sedimentation, desiccation, high turbidity, and high abundance of molluscan grazers. Short-term experiments showed that Codium was inferior under such conditions compared to Gracilaria, Ulva, Hypnea musciformis , and Agardhiella, decomposing faster when buried, being susceptible to desiccation, growing slower at high and low levels of nutrient and light, and being the only species grazed by Ilyanasa obsolata. To test if the success of Codium fragile could be related to its ability to colonize hard substrate, recruitment bricks were incubated in the shallow subtidal with and without a cover of unattached algae or sediments. Codium recruited well onto control bricks, but not onto bricks covered by algae or sediments. After one year  Codium, Gracilaria, Crassostrea virginica  (oyster) and Agardhiella were space-dominants, having tolerated temperature regimes of 2–28°C and desiccation at low spring tides. Thus Codium is only successful compared to native species by having moderate growth over a long season, and by being an effective colonizer of hard substrate in the shallow subtidal zone in the absence of high sedimentation or drift algae accumulations.

T1  - Effects of macromolecular mobility on the equilibrium and nonequilibrium behavior of vapor phase sorbates in natural organic matter
AN  - 305106298
AB  - This research focuses on the development of a more thorough, mechanistic-based understanding of the properties of natural organic matter (NOM), and how these materials, as macromolecules, manifest behavior similar to that found in synthetic macromolecule systems. Experimental investigations were performed to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of NOM materials, their equilibrium sorption/desorption behavior, nonequilibrium behavior, and effects of association with mineral matrices.    Differential scanning calorimetry and thermal mechanical analysis were used to characterize representative NOM material. Observations of glass transitions (TgS) in Leonardite humic acid and Organosolv lignin confirmed literature values and trends that are prevalent in synthetic macromolecule literature indicating that these materials display differences in macromolecular mobility above and below their T g. Most importantly, identification of this behavior allowed for development of protocols to investigate sorption and diffusion behavior in glassy and rubbery NOM materials.    Specific differences in vapor phase equilibrium behavior in highly purified NOM materials above and below their Tg were identified. In the glassy state, sorption of trichloroethylene could be described by micropore models, characteristic of glassy, synthetic macromolecules. Above the  Tg, sorptive behavior was well-described by Flory-Huggins theory, suggesting that the mobility and structural configuration of rubbery NOM materials may be analogous to the characteristic sorption behavior observed in more mobile, rubbery synthetic macromolecules.    Nonequilibrium experiments were used to probe transport behavior above and below Tg. Both Fickian and anomalous diffusion were observed; this behavior is analogous to transport behavior of synthetic macromolecules. Additionally, these studies demonstrated that the fundamental mass transfer mechanisms governing diffusion during sorption are different than those defining desorption.    Finally, differences in sorptive capacity of model soils (humic acid-coated mesoporous minerals) above and below the Tg of NOM are likely not due to a simple difference in surface areas of the mineral matrices, as suggested other by investigators. NOM may either block available pore space or present a kinetic limitation that does not allow access to the internal porosity of the model soil within experimental times.

T1  - The effects of hypoxic acclimatization on thermal tolerance in the channel catfish <i>Ictalurus punctatus</i>
AN  - 305048121
AB  - The effects of hypoxic acclimatization on thermal tolerance were examined in channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus. Hypoxic acclimatized channel catfish were cannulated in the dorsal aorta and decerebrated per animal use guidelines. The cannula placed in the dorsal aorta was used to measure cardiovascular variables. Fish were acclimatized to 50% (75 torr paO 2) oxygen concentration for a period of one week. After acclimatization the fish were moved to the experimental chamber which was attached to a temperature controlled recirculating water bath. Temperature was increased until critical thermal maximum (CTMax) was reached, signified by the onset of muscle spasms. Results demonstrated increases in heart rate and diastolic pressure. It was also observed that chronic hypoxic acclimatization increased the critical thermal maximum (CTMax).

T1  - The effect of acute and chronic elevation of temperature on aspects of the physiology of Antarctic nototheniid fishes
AN  - 2306802453
AB  - The notothenioid fishes, which dominate the upper shelf habitats of the Antarctic Continental Shelf, have evolved in a relatively thermally stable environment for at least 10-15 million years. With the upper lethal limits of these fishes around 4-6 C and the lower limits set by the freezing point of seawater, they are described as extreme stenotherms. As a result, it has been hypothesized that these fishes should exhibit marked responses to acute changes in temperature, but that acclimatory effects may be reduced with prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures is not likely to increase their thermal tolerance. This study was designed to investigate aspects of the physiological response of Antarctic nototheniid fishes to both acute and prolonged increases in temperature. Changes in haematology, metabolic scope for activity, cardiovascular performance, aerobic swimming ability and the capacity to tolerate additional stressors were investigated in the Antarctic nototheniid Pagothenia borchgrevinki, with some comparative work carried out on the closely related Trematomus bernacchii and the temperate-water notothenioids Notothenia angustata and Bovichtus variegatus. The responses to an acute change in temperature were found to vary between the closely related Antarctic nototheniids, most likely as a consequence of their differing ecotypes. Plasma glucose levels were measured in these fish for the first time and exhibited a delayed rise in response to an acute increase in temperature. Cardiac performance was found to be closely linked to prolonged swimming ability through thermal changes in P. borchgrevinki, indicating a cardiac limitation of aerobic performance. One factor which became apparent was that the acclimation of Antarctic nototheniids to temperatures only c 2 C above their habitat temperature results in a decrease in thermal sensitivity of a variety of physiological parameters. The most notable finding was that P. borchgrevinki possesses sufficient phenotypic plasticity to warm-acclimate prolonged swimming ability, cardiac performance and osmo-regulatory capacity after 4-6 weeks of exposure to 4 C, suggesting that the Antarctic nototheniids may not be as extremely stenothermal as previously assumed and that the consequences of climate change may not be as dire as has been predicted.

T1  - Evaluation of 'franklinothrips vespiformis' (crawford) (thysanoptera: aeolothripidae) as a natural enemy of glasshouse pests
AN  - 1812894423
AB  - Characteristics of Franklinothrips vespiformis (Crawford) (Thysanoptera: Aeolothripidae), a predatory thrips, were studied in order to aid its assessment as a potential biocontrol agent of glasshouse pests.
  The effect of constant temperatures on preimaginal development and pre-oviposition of F. vespiformis reared on irradiated Ephestia kuehniella eggs was studied.  About 294 degree-days above a threshold temperature of 12.3°C were required for F. vespiformis to complete development from egg to adult eclosion.  Franklinothrips vespiformis intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was 0.16 allowing successful mass rearing and release in biocontrol programmes.  Development times and reproductive potential on Heliothrips haemorrhoidalis (Bouché) and Tetranychus urticae Koch diets were significantly different and the spider mite diet was inadequate to support adult reproduction.  To facilitate short-term storage for the production and release of F. vespiformis, life-history consequences of exposing eggs and adults to moderately low temperatures were evaluated.  Temperatures above 7°C offered longer storage periods for adults without significantly affecting oviposition rates and fertility of stored adults.  Low temperature and storage period affected egg viability and subsequent development of pre-imaginal stages.  No eggs hatched after a 20-day period of storage at 5.5 and 7.0°C, whereas 12.5°C was suitable.  Overwintering and establishment potential of F. vespiformis in the U.K. were studied based on its cold tolerance.  Larval stages survived longer than adults at -5, 0 and 5°C.  Cold stress decreased the number of reproductive females and affected the number of viable eggs, reducing the establishment potential of the predator.  Low availability and poor quality of food and high densities increased larval cannibalistic behaviour whereas starved adults were prone to egg cannibalism of conspecific eggs.  Franklinothrips vespiformis appears a promising biocontrol agent for use in U.K. glasshouses with low risk of establishment and non-target effects.

T1  - Reproductive ecophysiology of cacti, with emphasis on fruit development and seed germination
AN  - 305346964
AB  - The reproductive ecophysiology of cactus fruit crops was studied. Responses of germination to temperature, water potential, time after harvest and light were investigated for the columnar cactus Stenocereus queretaroensis , which closely matched the typical climate of the rainy season in the native habitat of this columnar cactus from west-central Mexico. The water and carbon relations for young fruits of six platyopuntias were also investigated; the phloem, and not the xylem, is the sole supplier of water to young fruits. The phloem supplies about 90% of the daily increase in mass, the rest results from fruit photosynthesis. The nocturnal patterns of gas exchange reveal that fruits utilize Crassulacean acid metabolism. Finally, the carbon and water balances for fruits of Opuntia ficus-indica were studied throughout their development, including effects of drought and gibberellic acid. Fruit development occurred over 110 days. Fruits undergoing drought did not ripen at 80 d after anthesis, fruits treated with gibberellic acid did ripen, but were smaller and had aborted seeds at 80 d after anthesis. An additional chapter compares the acclimation responses to extreme temperatures of fruits versus young stems and old stems of Opuntia ficus-indica , revealing that the tolerance of reproductive organs is lower than for stems and it even decreases with fruit age. Supplementary chapters characterize the growth and photosynthetic responses to high temperatures, short-term drought, and available soil nitrogen by the hemiepiphytic cactus Hylocereus undatus; the responses to temperature for this species and for  Opuntia ficus-indica are then incorporated in a geographic information system to create maps identifying areas suitable for cultivation of these crop cacti in California.

AN  - 305346055
AB  - A number of molecular mechanisms have been implicated in biological tolerance of marine environmental stress. Among the best characterized of these is the heat shock response, which has been shown to play an important role in determining the distribution of marine invertebrates along natural gradients of stress (eg. thermal stress in the intertidal). The heat shock response also appears to play a critical role in determining the susceptibility of invertebrates to anthropogenic stress. In a parallel context, it has been proposed that multidrug resistance may play an important role in determining the survival of invertebrates along natural and anthropogenic gradients of toxic organic compounds.    This study characterized the role of both of these systems in the tolerance of natural stressors in model marine invertebrate systems. In the first section of the dissertation I demonstrated that, although Pacific oysters are capable of significant adaptive regulation of heat shock protein (HSP) expression, adaptive plasticity occurs at a physiologic cost to inducible stress tolerance.  Moreover, although adaptive regulation of HSPs is via a transcriptional mechanism during conditions of acute thermal stress, the response to chronic stress may not require continual transcriptional activation of HSP genes. In the second section of the dissertation I focused on the role of multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters in oocytes, embryos and larvae in model (sea urchin, starfish and urechis) systems. In the first chapter of this section I described species-specific differences in transporter expression and consequent differences in susceptibility to naturally degraded hydrocarbons. In the second chapter I hypothesized that the reason for organic susceptibility in echinoderms is not due to the absence of a transporter, but rather due to the specificity of the predominant transporter family expressed in each species. Consistent with this hypothesis I showed that the predominant type of transporter expressed in echinoderm oocytes and embryos bear homology to the multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) family rather than the multidrug resistance (P-gp/MDR) family. I examined the potential consequences of this difference for transporter substrate specificity and we measured the level of MRP expression during early development. I show that echinoderms possess a characteristic MRP transport phenotype that is activated at fertilization.

T1  - Effects of exercise intensity and age on acclimation to a hot, humid environment
AN  - 305342828
AB  - This study assessed: (1) effects of a 14 day high intensity running protocol on time course and magnitude of heat acclimation responses and (2) age effect on adaptive responses among highly fit males. Nine younger (20.4 ± 0.8 years) and eight older (45.8 ± 1.9 years) males ran 30 minutes daily at 75% VO2max in hot, humid (35°C, 35% RH) conditions. Measures included heart rate (HR), core (Tc), mean skin (Tsk) and regional surface (RST) temperatures, resting plasma volume (PV), sweat volume, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and thermal sensation. Infrared thermographic imaging provided an accurate surface temperature measure that accounted for the range of temperatures existing within a region. Tc, mean Tsk, RST, HR, RPE and thermal sensation significantly decreased across time for both groups (P < 0.05). <p>   Core to skin thermal gradient significantly increased across protocol; older participants had a significantly greater gradient than younger participants on day 1. HR, post-trial mean Tsk and post-trial RST were significantly less for older when compared with younger runners. HR decreased similarly for younger (7.4%) and older (10.3%) participants. PV increased by 2.9% across time with no significant difference between groups. Sweat sodium concentration for forehead and back regions significantly decreased across time with no significant differences between groups. Most adaptations occurred by day 8. Decreases in Tc, mean Tsk and RST indicate improved heat transfer capacity given consistent metabolic heat production resulting from a set workload across protocol. Post-trial mean Tsk and RST differences between groups may result from age-related peripheral vascular and sweating mechanism differences. Despite between group differences in HR, mean Tsk and RST, younger and older participants responded similarly across protocol. This suggests that highly fit older and younger males have similar heat tolerance capabilities following high intensity exercise-based heat acclimation protocols.

T1  - Pain sensitivity and the development of temporomandibular disorders
AN  - 305311676
AB  - The pathophysiological processes that contribute to the development and maintenance of TMD are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether pain sensitivity and various psychosocial factors extracted from self-reported questionnaires, are predictive factors for the development of TMD. A prospective study on 244 initially pain-free females aged 18 to 34 years was conducted. Measures of pain sensitivity and questionnaire assessments of psychological state and trait were performed at baseline and repeated annually. Over the past 34 months, 16 subjects developed TMD. Subjects who developed TMD demonstrated significantly lower baseline pressure pain threshold at the wrist and masseter muscle when compared to control subjects who did not develop TMD. TMD subjects also had significantly higher levels of baseline anxiety and somatization than control subjects.    When the correlations among different pain modalities were investigated, it was found that they were significantly correlated, although the strength of the associations was weak to moderate. When each value of different pain measures was transformed into a Z-score, plotting the combined Z-scores of all pain measures revealed normally distributed Z-scores. By dividing the distribution into tertiles, it was found that a higher number of TMD subjects (8 out of 16) fell into the lowest tertile of the distribution compared to the other two tertiles. The combined pain sensitivity Z-scores also predicted clinically assessed facial muscle and joint pain sensitivity, as well as the levels of psychosocial distress and dysfunction. As for the long-term stability of different pain measures (i.e., two years), it was found that there was a long-term temporal stability of the various pain measures, especially for the measure of C-fiber thermal pain tolerance.    At their first annual follow-up appointments, pressure pain threshold assessed at the temporalis and masseter muscle, as well as the TMJ showed significant decreases relative to the previous year's baseline values for TMD subjects but not for controls. Collectively, these data suggest that individuals who develop TMD show altered processing of nociceptive information prior to and following the development of TMD.

T1  - Mechanisms of adaptation to seasonal temperature variation in marine fish (<i>Gadus morhua</i> and <i>Zoarces viviparus</i>): Physiological, biochemical and theoretical aspects
AN  - 305291429
AB  - Oxygen availability to mitochondria and their functional capacity are the key-factors in setting the thermal tolerance limits. Onset of the limitations in the aerobic scope at pejus temperatures (Tp) limits the geographical distribution. Further changes in temperature towards its extremes results in loss of aerobic scope at critical temperature.    Measurements of the temperature dependence of the whole body rate of oxygen consumption (Mo2) showed that with acclimation to cold the Mot level was compensated by 50–60%, but at the same time the temperature dependence decreases 2 folds. These changes are probably related to the changes in concentration and the functional capacities of mitochondria in cold acclimation. The studied populations showed differences in temperature dependence of Mo 2 only at temperatures above 13–15°C.    Critical oxygen concentration ([O2]c) shows an exponential temperature dependence and reaches ambient oxygen concentration at high temperature, implying the complete loss of aerobic scope for the whole animal, which is 22.5°C for eelpout. A theoretical evaluation of total oxygen conductance showed that it has a hyperbolic dependence on Mo2  and at 15°C it is used at 50% of its capacity. Consequently, the capacity to lower the [O2]c is limited above this temperature. Most likely, 15°C is the pejus temperature for eelpout.    Analysis of the functional capacity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) revealed that this enzyme has no temperature induced functional limitation at physiological conditions in vivo below 16°C. We did not find an effect of LDH-B allozymes on the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters in crude homogenates. We also did not observe expression of new LDH isozymes during acclimation to different temperatures. The constant of substrate inhibition as well as the Arrhenius activation energy were significantly changed with acclimation to cold, which implies changes in enzyme functioning. Further thermodynamic analysis suggested that this could be explained by an introduction of additional hydrogen bonds in the protein structure (non-genetic post translational protein modification). This mechanism may significantly shift pyruvate distribution between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in cold acclimation in favour of the aerobic one. This suggestion was also supported by Mo2 measurements and may be one of the mechanisms contributing to the acclimation to the seasonal temperature variation.

T1  - Growth and survival of age 0<sup>+</sup> Shubenacadie River striped bass (<i>Morone saxatilis</i>) in relation to temperature and salinity
AN  - 305290819
AB  - Shubenacadie River striped bass are exposed to a wide range of temperatures and salinities, although their effects on the survival and growth of under-yearlings have yet to be studied. As such, there were several objectives of this thesis: to determine the effect of salinity for egg incubation; determine the effect of temperature and salinity on larval stages; determine the optimal temperature and salinity for the growth of juveniles; determine the thermal tolerance of juveniles using both static and dynamic methods; to develop a model to predict the intrinsic growth capacity of Shubenacadie River striped bass using temperature, salinity and body size; and to then extend that model to describe growth in the wild environment.    The model generated showed that growth and temperature had an exponential relationship (since data was only available up to the optimal), growth and body size followed a relationship not previously published and growth was independent of salinity.

T1  - Thermal modulation of the excretion of benzo[a]pyrene in teleosts
AN  - 305239654
AB  - The effect of temperature on the biliary excretion of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in teleosts was studied in live rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, as well as isolated hepatocytes obtained from rainbow trout, sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, black rockfish, Sebastes melanops, and chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus. BaP concentration in blood of rainbow trout declined biphasically with time. With acute temperature increase (8 to 18°C), clearance rates increased (Qb = 0.10 ml/min) and terminal half-lives decreased (X1 = 2.35 min and X2 = 3786.2 min). Conversely, with acute temperature decrease (18 to 8°C), clearance rates decreased (Qb = 0.05) and terminal half-lives increased (X1 = 3.43 min, X2 = 5250.7 min). The highest BaP body burdens were found in liver, visceral fat, kidney, and gill respectively. Metabolites of BaP excreted to the bile, included diols and tetrols (including 9,10-diol and 7,8-diol), quinones including (3,6-dione), and phenols (including 9-OH and 3-OH). Phase II metabolite excretion from isolated rainbow trout hepatocytes in suspension increased significantly in cells acclimated to 18°C and exposed to BaP at 8°C. Phase II metabolite excretion from trout hepatocytes grown as monolayer cultures did not change with acclimation temperature but was altered concomitantly with acute temperature. Significantly different temperature effects were seen in BaP toxicokinetics in hepatocytes of marine teleosts. Given the sensitivity of BaP clearance and Phase I metabolism to temperature, it is suggested that excretion may be the rate-limiting step in the elimination of BaP from teleosts. BaP excretion is compensated for with respect to acclimatory changes in temperature but responds concomitantly to acute temperature change.

T1  - Development of a novel symbiotic targeted towards dogs. (BL: DXN063623)
AN  - 301587807
AB  - The development of a novel synbiotic targeted towards dogs was investigated using Lactobacillus strains obtained from the culture collection of the Waltham Center for Pet Nutrition (Waltham-on-the Wolds, Leicestershire, UK), having originated from canine large intestine biopsy samples taken from sedated healthy adult dogs. 
  For the selection of the potential probiotic strain, L. mucosae NCIMB 41149, L. acidophilus NCIMB 41085, L. ruminis NCIMB 41151, L. reuteri NCIMB 41152 were studied for their ability to utilize, and grow on various monosaccharides and oligosaccharides, in order to find out on which type of oligosaccharides further investigation should be focused. Excluding L. ruminis, all other three lactobacilli showed good growth rates and were further studied for acid and bile tolerance. Acidic environment (pH 3.5) had a more rigorous effect especially for L. acidophilus and L. reuteri. 
  For the main selection criterion, the work focused on the ability of those strains, when grown on different carbohydrates to inhibit the growth of three pathogenic microorganisms, two from canine origin (E. coli HE 320 and S. enterica serotype typhimurium DT 104) and a human E. coli 0157:H7 (VT). 
  Inhibitory effect was induced by the presence of maltooligosaccharides mixtures in the growth medium suggesting that the α-1,4 linkage of glucose may be important in the production of the antimicrobial agent(s). 
  Crude cell-free extracts of L. acidophilus and L reuteri were screened for their ability to hydrolyse different glycosidic linkages, and their ability to be used in oligosaccharide synthesis reactions. 
  The best synthetic activity was observed for α-galactosidase extracted from L. reuteri at the end of the exponential growth phase when grown in the presence of raffrnose. The hydrolytic activity of the enzyme showed optimum pH between 4.5 and 5.0, and optimum temperature 50 °C. The Km value was 0.55 mM and the Vmax was 0.80 µmol/min per mg of protein at this conditions. The protein was purified and gave a single band on SDS-PAGE of an estimated molecular mass of about 64kDa.

T1  - Cyclooxygenases and sensory processing.
AN  - 301585504
AB  - Cyclooxygenases (COX) are the rate limiting enzymes in the production of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid.  Both COX and prostaglandins, are important in inflammation and nociception.  The aim of this study was to investigate the role of individual COX isoforms in inflammation and nociceptive processing, using COX-1 and COX-2 knockout mice.
  Acute nociceptive withdrawal responses to thermal and mechanical stimulation were investigated in COX-1 and COX-2 wild-type, heterozygote and knockout mice.  No difference was observed following COX-1 knockout indicating COX-1 has no involvement in acute nociception.  COX-2 knockout animals had significantly lower mechanical nociceptive thresholds but longer thermal latencies than wild-type animals.  Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 in wild-type animals caused similar changes in mechanical and thermal responses as genetic ablation.  Inhibition of both COX isoforms had no effect on nociceptive responses.  COX-2 is important in acute thermal and mechanical nociceptive processing.
  A novel model of inflammatory arthritis was developed in mice using injection of Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA).  FCA injection resulted in rapid significant ipsilateral tibiotarsal join swelling in all mice of both COX lines. In COX-1 female knockout mice swelling was reduced compared to wild-type animals on days 13-20.  All COX-1 transgenic mice developed thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, but male COX-1 knockout mice had significantly longer withdrawal latencies than wild-type mice.  COX-1 may therefore play a role in chronic oedema and thermal hyperalgesia.
  COX-2 knockout mice had significantly reduced joint swelling on days 2-6 compared to wild-type animals.  COX-2 wild-type mice developed inflammatory mechanical allodynia that was not seen in knockout animals.  COX-2 may therefore be involved in acute oedema and the development of mechanical allodynia.
  COX-1 and COX-2 have different and distinct functions in inflammation and nociceptive processing.  These findings may have an important impact on the use of COX-2 inhibitors as analgesics and in the treatment of inflammation.

T1  - Ontogeny of osmoregulation of the embryos of two intertidal crabs Hemigrapsus edwardsii and Hemigrapsus crenulatus
AN  - 2306236802
AB  - The effects of variations in salinity on the developing embryos of two intertidal crabs, Hemigrapsus edwardsii and Hemigrapsus crenulatus were studied in relation to short term (6 - 96 h) and long term (continuous) exposure to low salinities from spawning to hatching. Developing embryos of both species were grouped into 5 stages that were timed under standard conditions in the laboratory; Stage (1) Cleavage to Blastula, (2) Gastrula, (3) Eyespot & chromatophores, (4) Yolk in 4 lobes and (5) Yolk in 2 lobes. The total incubation periods of embryos from spawning to hatching of H. edwardsii and H. crenulatus were 62.0 and 43.0 days respectively at a constant temperature of 15 C. Embryos of H. edwardsii (20 nL stage 1 to 35 nL stage 5) are larger than the embryos of H. crenulatus (7 nL to 18 nL). Ultrastructural studies revealed the presence of two distinct egg membranes in these embryos. Silver staining demonstrated a distinct patch on the surface of the embryos of both species, presumably corresponding to an area of high chloride permeability. This structure appeared at the gastrula stage and was present throughout the embryonic development until hatching when it disappeared. It is suggested that this structure corresponds to the embryonic dorsal organ and plays a role in either the uptake or excretion of salts. Salinity tolerance experiments revealed that the postgastrula stage embryos of both species are remarkably tolerant of periods of dilution, even down to 1 percent seawater, for many hours and that they hyperosmoregulate throughout development. Pre gastrula embryos (stage 1) were nearly isosmotic in all salinities and were less tolerant of hyposaline exposure. Normal development and successful hatching occurred in 50 percent seawater for both species provided the exposure commenced after gastrulation. Thus, the gastrula stage appears to be the critical stage when the capacity to osmoregulate commences. The four cations Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ (and associated anions) were major osmotic effectors in the embryos of H. crenulatus but contributed only about half of the total osmolality. Na+ and K+ were the main cations in these embryos. The average concentrations of all four cations were better regulated than was total osmolality indicating the involvement of other osmolytes in osmoregulation. Na+/K+ ATPase activity was undetectable in stage 1 embryos but rose steadily between gastrulation and hatching. A relatively larger increase in the activity of this ion transport enzyme at the Yolk in 4 lobe stage in embryos incubated in 50 percent seawater supports its involvement in osmoregulation. The egg membranes of H. crenulatus are very permeable to water and ions throughout development. There were two components of water and sodium exchange with the seawater in all embryos; a rapidly exchanging pool and a slowly exchanging pool. This rapidly exchanging pool may represent the external embryonic membranes and compartments while the slowly exchanging pool is thought to represent the embryo/yolk. Half times for turnover of embryonic (slow pool) water and sodium ranged from 0.25 to 1.25 h and 1 to 6 h respectively, throughout development. As the embryos maintain ahyperosmotic state for much longer times than these they must be actively hyperosmoregulating. That is they must be in a dynamic steady state involving the active uptake of salts and excretion of osmotically entering water. Oxygen consumption rates of both H. edwardsii and H. crenulatus increased during development and the rate increase was greater at the end of the incubation period. Rates of oxygen consumption of embryos in acute exposure to dilute seawater varied with salinity and exposure time for all developmental stages. There was a significant increase in the total metabolic cost of development, in terms of oxygen consumed, for embryos developing in 50percent seawater compared with development in normal seawater. This could be attributed primarily to an extended development time rather than an increased metabolic rate at any stage.

T1  - Larval biology and ecology of a non-indigenous species, the slipper limpet <i>Crepidula onyx</i>
AN  - 305472935
AB  - The slipper limpet Crepidula onyx is a non-indigenous species (NIS) in Hong Kong waters introduced in 1970s from the United States. This species has established a small dense population in Victoria Harbour but not in western and eastern waters of Hong Kong. In this study I first examined the effects of temperature, salinity and food on the larval survival, growth and settlement as well as juvenile development of  C. onyx. I found that short-term food deprivation, especially in the first two days of larval development, has detrimental effects on larval development; and that both low salinity and temperature reduced survival and growth rate of larvae and juveniles, and prolonged the pre-competent period. These results indicate that confined geographic distribution pattern of  C. onyx is closely linked to larval tolerance to salinity changes and larval food supplies in Hong Kong waters.    To have a better understanding of aggregated distribution pattern of this species, the larval settlement of C. onyx in response to multiple natural cues derived from conspecifics, natural biofilms and sympatrics was investigated in this study. The results showed that cues derived from adult Crepidula onyx or sympatric mussel, Perna viridis , were waterborne. However, the cues from the biofilm were surface-associated and dependent on the components of biofilms. Both waterborne conspecific cues (or sympatric mussel cues) and surface associated biofilm cues may act synergistically, leading to the aggregated distribution of adult C. onyx or associative attachment of C. onyx to mussel in nature. Furthermore, larval settlement in response to biofilms of different ages was affected by both bacterial abundance and the differences of bacterial community structure while the response to bacterial film was strain-specific, indicating that shift in dominancy of certain bacterial strains in biofilm over time is crucial for the induction of larval settlement and metamorphosis.

T1  - Investigations toward implementation of <i>Neozygites tanajoae</i> sp. Nov. as a classical biological control agent against the Cassava green mite in Africa
AN  - 304792247
AB  - Cassava, Manihot esculenta Crantz (Euphorbiaceae), is a major food crop in sub-Saharan Africa. Cassava green mite (CGM),  Mononychellus tanajoa (Acari: Tetranychidae), became one of the most important pests of this crop in Africa after its introduction from the Neotropics. The fungal pathogen Neozygites tanajoae Delalibera, Humber & Hajek sp. nov. is one of the most important natural enemies of CGM in Brazil, where cassava is native. The introduction of efficient isolates from Brazil to Africa has great potential for reducing losses caused by CGM. In this dissertation I present important steps toward the implementation of  N. tanajoae as a classical biocontrol agent of CGM in Africa; selection of efficient isolates and development of in vitro production and preservation techniques for N. tanajoae cultures. To identify potential isolates from South America to be released in Africa, several bioassays were conducted comparing 23 N. tanajoae isolates and 2 N. floridana isolates from Brazil, Colombia and Benin. Most isolates from Brazil were highly virulent and infected only CGM. Sixteen isolates caused more than 89% mortality and greater than 62% mummification. The median time to mummification ranged from 4.4 to 6.7 days. Significant differences in the number of primary conidia and capilliconidia produced by Brazilian isolates were observed after 12 hours at 100% RH. Some Brazilian isolates produced significantly more primary conidia than the African isolates. Isolation methods, culture media for in vitro production and a protocol for long term storage of hyphal bodies of N. tanajoae  are reported here for the first time. Continuous growth of  N. tanajoae was achieved using IPL-41 + 5 −10% fetal bovine serum + 0.3% lactalbumin hydrolysate + 0.3% yeastolate. Cultures of  N. tanajoae can only be preserved at ultra-low temperatures of −80°C or −196°C, using I% trehalose + 2% dimethyl sulfoxide as cryoprotective agents. N. tanajoae has traditionally been referred to as  N. floridana; however, I present data justifying its designation as a new species of Neozygites. N. tanajoae can be readily distinguished from N. floridana based on SSU rDNA sequences, host range, growth in culture media, ability to withstand cryopreservation and tolerance to cold temperature (4°C).

T1  - Methodologies for assesing the effects of low temperature on the establishment potential of the non-native arthropods
AN  - 301599570
AB  - Non-native biological control agents used in greenhouses may cause permanent damage to native ecosystems if they establish in the wild.  British winters are often considered to be sufficiently cold to prohibit establishment.  However, some species have become established after licences for release were granted on these grounds by the appropriate statutory body (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs).  A reliable protocol for establishing overwintering potential is therefore required.
 A laboratory based method which produces estimates of the lower temperature threshold for development, thermal requirement for development, potential annual voltinism, supercooling point, lethal temperature, and lethal time is proposed.  The protocol was developed and tested on Eretmocerus eremicus and Delphastus catalinae (this study) with concurrent investigations on Macrolophus caliginosus and Amblyseius californicus.  Results of the laboratory tests were compared with actual mortality during winter field trials in Britain.
 There was a significant correlation between maximum survival time in the field (Log d) and LTime50 values recorded in the laboratory.  On this basis, a negative degree-day model was produced which estimates mortality due to chronic exposure to low temperature.  The model performed well when estimated mortality was compared to actual field data and in future could be refined to produce a comparative cold tolerance index.

T1  - Developmental variability in loliginid squid (<i>Loligo forbesi</i> and <i>Sepioteuthis australis</i>).. (BL: DXN065879)
AN  - 301585319
AB  - As post-hatch survival is critically dependent upon the successful capture and consumption of zooplanktonic prey, variability in hatchling morphology (e.g. size, shape, presence of abnormally) and physiology (e.g. thermal tolerance) are likely to exert significant influence upon survival.  This thesis investigates embryonic variability in two temperate loliginid squid:  the Northern Hemisphere Loligo forbesi Steenstrup 1856 and the Southern Hemisphere Sepioteuthis australis Quoy and Gimard 1832.
  Developmental variability in L. forbesi and S. australis largely manifests via chromatophore pattern.  The plasticity and thermal sensitivity of chromatophore characters exceed those of standard morphological characters (e.g. body shape and size).  Elevation of incubation temperature is associated with reduced chromatophore number and heightened pattern asymmetry.  Correlation between temperature and hatchling phenotype is sufficiently strong to permit estimation of mean thermal history from measure of multiple chromatophore and morphological characters.  Increased water temperature is associated with increased frequency of morphological abnormality.  In situ assessment of embryonic development in S. australis indicates ~89% egg viability within egg stands.  Significant intra-seasonal differences in incidence of mortality and abnormality appear to reflect changes in environmental conditions.  Embryos reared under fluctuating (field) thermal conditions grow faster than those reared under stable (aquaria) thermal conditions.  Despite variation in size-at-hatch, no concomitant differences are observed in mantle muscle structure.  The results of this thesis indicate no significant relationship between hatchling phenotype and underlying physiological processes (i.e. plasticity).  I discuss the idea that quantification of embryonic development in cephalopods has relevance to both fisheries management and biomonitoring.

T1  - Uniparental incubation in a cool climate: behavioural adaptations in the eurasian dotterel
AN  - 301566456
AB  - Energetic constraint during reproduction may limit the number or quality of young that a parent can produce per breeding attempt or the parent's longevity or future productivity, ultimately constraining lifetime reproductive success. The Eurasian dotterel Charadrius morinellus experienced energetic constraint during the Incubation period. Dotterel breed in the cold arctic-alpine zone and most breeding attempts are cared for by the male alone. The combination of a cold climate, giving high energetic costs of incubation and thermoregulation, and restricted foraging time due to uniparental Incubation, resulted in non-adaptive mass loss and constrained Investment of time and energy In incubation. If the incubation period is potentially energetically constrained, then behavioural mechanisms that reduce energetic costs could increase the production of young. When more energetically constrained, dotterel reduced the energetic cost of incubation by scheduling trips in conditions when the unattended eggs would have cooled more slowly and by making fewer, but longer trips. When suffering severe energetic constraint, some dotterel neglected their eggs for many hours: dotterel embryos' high chilling tolerance may have been necessary for successful uniparental incubation In a cold and unpredictable environment. Dotterel selected nest sites that allowed them to build larger nests with larger linings. Larger, better insulated nests probably decreased heat loss from the eggs and sitting parents, so reducing energetic costs during incubation. Sitting dotterel oriented into the wind, which probably reduced the disruption of their plumage and minimised their energetic expenditure on thermoregulation. In cooler conditions, dotterel changed their nest defence strategy and used energetically cheaper but probably riskier responses to simulated predators. Behaviours may be shaped under conflicting selective pressures and dotterel's management of their high energetic costs during the incubation period was constrained by egg-predation: dotterel's incubation scheduling appeared to be influenced by diurnal variation in the risk of predation and dotterel's nest defence behaviour traded-off energetic costs and the risk of predation. I declare that this thesis has been composed by myself and that it embodies the results of my own research. Where appropriate, I have acknowledged the nature and extent of work carried out in collaboration with others. This thesis presents data collected by myself over 2,212h spent in the alpine study areas from 288 days during my PhD field seasons in 1996,1997 and 1998. I also analyse some of Scottish Natural Heritage's dataset on dotterel biology collected between 1987 and 1999 by a team of fieldworkers, including myself (in Chapters 2,7 and 8).

T1  - Spawning behavior and larval biology of the American horseshoe crab, <i>Limulus polyphemus</i>, in a microtidal coastal lagoon
AN  - 275637060
AB  - The American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus (Linnaeus), typically inhabits estuaries and coastal areas with pronounced semi-diurnal and diurnal tides that are used to synchronize the timing of spawning, larval hatching, and emergence. Spawning occurs in the intertidal zone of sandy beaches. Tidally timed activities of L. polyphemus were investigated in a microtidal coastal lagoon [Indian River Lagoon complex (IRL), Florida] to determine the effect of a system that lacks significant tidal cues on spawning and larval hatching. Spawning occurred year-round, but in the absence of tidal cues, was asynchronous. Peaks in larval abundance were independent of spawning events but were associated with changes in water level. These results indicate that the reproductive activity of horseshoe crabs inhabiting the IRL is different from populations that occur in areas that experience regular tidal changes.    Limulus polyphemus typically inhabits estuaries with salinities ranging from 5–34. Previous studies indicate that the optimal temperature and salinity ranges for early development are 25–30°C and 20–30, respectively. While embryos have been shown to develop at salinities ≤40, tolerance of higher salinities has not been investigated. The osmotic concentration of the perivitelline fluid remained isoosmotic to the external medium in all salinities. These results indicate that high temperature and salinity conditions during the reproductive season influence the rate of larval development, yet, have a limited effect on survivorship and do not account for the low abundance of larvae in the IRL.    Horseshoe crab embryos undergo development below the sediment surface, hatch, and enter the water column when the nest is inundated. Thus, hatching may be facilitated by environmental triggers that serve to synchronize larval hatching and emergence with periods of high water. To test this hypothesis, the effects of hydration, agitation, osmotic shock, and hypoxia on the hatching success of L. polyphemus embryos were determined. All treatments facilitated hatching, yet hydration coupled with agitation produced the highest hatching rates.    Endogenous activity rhythms that match predictable environmental cycles may enable L. polyphemus to time swimming activity to prevent stranding on the beach.  Autocorrelation and MESA analysis of the activity records revealed a circatidal rhythm with a free running period of ≈12.3 h. In nontidal and microtidal systems, larvae may lack an endogenous rhythm due to the lack of a tidal entrainment cue and may increase their chances of being stranded on the beach when inundated.

T1  - In situ monitoring and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients in estuarine waters
AN  - 2033212317
AB  - This thesis describes the use of in situ and laboratory techniques for monitoring nitrate, phosphate and master variables in the environment. Chapter One presents a general overview of nutrients, how they are essential for aquatic biota, their general characteristics and the importance of their behaviour in estuaries. Commonly used analytical methods for nutrient determinations in natural waters are also evaluated. Chapter Two reports the use of chemometrics to determine trends in historical time-series physicochemical datasets {e.g. nitrate+nitrite, phosphate, river flow, precipitation, suspended solids, water temperature and chlorophyll a) from the Tamar catchment, UK. The results provided useful information about correlations between the studied variables. The influence of time delay to correlate variables, such as rainfall and river flow, rainfall and nitrate+nitrite, river flow and nitrate+nitrite, rainfall and phosphate, river flow and phosphate, demonstrated the interaction between variables over time, and increased their correlation coefficients. Seasonal trends were separated using PCA. Models for nitrate+nitrite and phosphate were built to predict their behaviour based on the other five physicochemical variables, and explained 91.3 and 72.9 % of the variance for nitrate+nitrite and phosphate, respectively. In Chapter Three evaluation of different natural waters sample storage techniques is reported. Results indicate diat it is generally not possible to develop a single storage protocol for different kinds of natural waters. During sample storage the preservation of nutrients was found to be extremely matrix dependent, e.g. phosphate co-predpitated when calcium rich samples were frozen, and chemical treatment of samples rich in dissolved organic carbon resulted in a slight increase in phosphate concentration. In order to overcome these problems, practical guidelines on how to elaborate a site specific protocol for sample storage are presented. Chapter Four reports the development and deployment of a submersible flow injection spectrophotometric (submersible FI) analyser for determination of nitrate in estuarine waters. Key features of the analyser are its portability and ease of deployment owing to its small size, weight and low buoyancy. The analyser was optimised to perform accurately in the laboratory, on board ship (during the Impact Cruise) and in situ during field surveys. The detection limit achieved was 2.8 micro.g L-1 N whilst die linear range could be varied from 2.8 - 100 ^g L”^ N up to 100 - 2000 |J,g L”' N over a salinity range of 0 - 35 %o requiring only small changes in the manifold The good instrument performance was assured during an intercomparison exercise (32 laboratories) for the determination of nitrate in seawater (assigned tolerance 327.6 plus or minus 33.6 micro.g L-1, submersible FI 351.4 plus or minus 28.0 micro.g L-1) and comparison with the University of Plymouth reference method. The results from eight surveys within the Tamar Estuary for the monitoring of nitrate, phosphate, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, conductivity and temperature, are presented in Chapter Five. These results were comparable with previous literature datasets, e.g. nitrate+nitrite and phosphate concentrations. This suggests that estuarine conditions have remained fairly consistent over the last 20 years. Laboratory experiments undertaken to help understand some of the environmental processes previously described are presented in Chapter Six. The aim of the investigation was to monitor dissolved (<0.45 micro.m) organic and inorganic phosphorus (Po, Pi) forms that could be released into the estuarine mixing zone. Results indicate that a measurable and significant release of Po, from suspended sediments, occurred when salinity was increased to 5 and 10 parts per thousand prior to the release of PL The analytical method proved to be very sensitive and reproducible (RSD < 3%) for this type of matrix, achieving limits of detection ranging from 1.8 - 3.0 micro.g L-1 P-PO4 with recovery of the organic phosphorus model compound typically between 76 - 87 %.

T1  - Physiological diversity in insects: Large scale patterns
AN  - 304790240
AB  - Large scale variation in insect physiological diversity was investigated. Specifically, this work concerns interspecific variation in thermal tolerances, water loss, development and metabolic rate across the globe, the way that variation in these characters is partitioned at higher taxonomic levels, and, in those cases where body mass is regularly reported, the relationship between the variable of interest and body size. The rationale for the investigation is the increasing need for information concerning various physiological assumptions that macroecologists routinely make, and to demonstrate that studies of large-scale variation in physiological traits may provide insights into comparative physiology that are less apparent from small-scale studies. The investigation of insect upper and lower thermal limits provides some support for the physiological tolerance assumption of the climatic variability hypothesis proposed to explain Rapoport's rule, and highlights the range of variation found in insects, and the need for coupled information on tolerances and geographic range size. There is also significant variation in desiccation resistance such that water loss rates tend to be positively related to rainfall. Geographic variation in temperature dependence of development provides evidence of adaptation to both temperature and length of the reproductive season. This provides some support for the polemical idea of latitudinal compensation in development rate. After removing the effects of trial temperature and body mass, it is shown that environmental temperature significantly influences interspecific variation in metabolic rate in the direction predicted by metabolic cold adaptation and takes the form of an increase the slope of the metabolic rate-temperature relationship in Northern, but not in Southern, Hemisphere species. From this work, it is clear that much variation in insect physiological tolerances is partitioned at higher taxonomic levels, which has important implications for comparative physiology. Furthermore, despite its importance, body size is regularly reported in only some kinds of investigations (metabolic rate, water loss rate), whereas in others this variable is often ignored. In short, this thesis shows that although large-scale comparative physiology can contribute considerable understanding to both physiology and ecology, there is much that remains to be done.

T1  - The reproductive ecology of Antarctic free -spawning molluscs
AN  - 304786798
AB  - This study on the free-spawning Antarctic limpet Nacella concinna  and soft-shelled clam Laternula elliptica has revealed new information about reproduction in these species. N. concinna and L. elliptica show long-term and continuous reproductive strategies over their mature lifetime. Gametogenic cycles last ∼18 to 24 months leading to overlapping cohorts of oocytes within the same ovary. The initiation of gametogenesis coincides with the spring phytoplankton bloom. Vitellogenesis and spermiogenesis take ∼12 months. Reproductive processes continue over the austral winter fuelled by body reserves. Spawning is annual for N. concinna coinciding with the spring bloom, a strategy expressed by related Nacella spp. inhabiting the Southern Ocean. L. elliptica appears to have multiple spawning events in a year. The timing of the major spawning events in geographically isolated populations of L. elliptica moves from late summer to mid-winter across a latitudinal cline (from higher to lower latitudes). Annual reproductive effort in both species varies in response to the inter-annual variability in environmental conditions.    Antarctic free-spawners require ∼100 times more sperm to achieve the same levels of fertilization success as temperate and tropical free-spawners. Specific spawning behaviour are required to enhance success (e.g. synchronous release and spawning aggregations). The investment in individual sperm may be balanced by the extreme longevity of the sperm. Temperatures and salinities outside the normal tolerance range of the animals reduces fertilization success and increases abnormal development. The highly stenothermal and stenohalinic gametes and early life stages act to delimit the geographical distribution of these species around Antarctica. Narrow tolerance limits and slowed gametogenic and developmental processes make free-spawners extremely vulnerable to environmental change (as predicted by global warming models). The developmental rates of Antarctic molluscs can be 15–18 times greater than temperate and tropical molluscs. Reproductive processes, fertilization and embryonic development in Antarctic bivalves and possibly in other Antarctic invertebrates shows no temperature compensation.    This study has provided new information about the strategy of free-spawning in very cold waters. It appears from the data that free-spawners in Antarctic waters are living at the extreme edge of their ability to reproduce which makes their presence there quite remarkable.

T1  - Nutrient status and planktonic nitrogen fixation in Lake Victoria, Africa
AN  - 304779840
AB  - Eutrophication of Lake Victoria is attributable to the burgeoning human population in its watershed. The lake is experiencing increasing anthropogenic P loads from expanding urban, agricultural and industrial development. Paleolimnological and nutrient status indicators indicate excess P on a system scale. Excessive P has stimulated phytoplankton biomass and promoted blooms of N-fixing cyanobacteria. High algal biomass provides organic matter that contributes to extensive oxygen depletion in hypolimnetic waters during the stratified period. Low oxygen concentrations cause a complex suite of direct and indirect impacts including loss of aquatic animals and changes in nutrient cycling. Anoxia may be contributing to fish kills upon upwelling in Lake Victoria, and also causes release of materials bound to the bottom sediments including P. This release of nutrients reinforces eutrophication during periods of deeper and stronger mixing when dissolved nutrients are redistributed in the water column.    Data from this study suggest two patterns controlling nutrient status and phytoplankton biomass production in the surface waters of Lake Victoria. The first is seasonal alteration of N and P limitation and underwater light. Circumstantial evidence indicates that thermal stratification led to better light conditions for increased phytoplankton biomass, and increased P and N deficiency. Higher light during stratification compensated for and lessened effects of N deficiency and hence maintained higher algal biomass. Destratification and deeper mixing led to low underwater irradiance and reduced algal biomass and nutrient limitation. Entrainment of nutrient-rich hypolimnetic waters with low algal biomass reduces the potential for nutrient limitation during periods of stronger and deep mixing. A second pattern controlling nutrient status is a longitudinal pattern of increasing light limitation and decreasing nutrient limitation, especially P, from inshore to offshore. Generally, light was the principal factor limiting phytoplankton production offshore as the ratio I24/Ik was often below one and indicating light deficiency.    Thermal stratification and destratification influenced cyanobacterial species composition. Relatively warmer and shallowly mixing epilimnion promoted elevated N-fixing cyanobacteria and heterocyst biomass production which in turn led to elevated rates of algal N-fixation and rapid N turnover during stratification. N-fixation was an important source of N in Lake Victoria that resulted in increased total N as well as higher particulate N:P ratios during the stratified period. N-fixation in Lake Victoria was predictable from heterocyst abundances and light attenuation. Heterocyst abundances can also be used to infer N-availability in Lake Victoria and as guide to water resource management in the lake.    Overall, Lake Victoria is an example of a large ecosystem in which the phytoplankton community is usually limited by light availability but seasonally limited by nutrient availability. The ability to identify factors limiting phytoplankton community is of considerable importance to water management practices of Lake Victoria. Since both P and N are limiting, their reduction is essential in the control of cyanobacterial blooms and eutrophication of Lake Victoria. Nutrient status also provides a simple and yet an important tool for monitoring water quality.

T1  - Morphology and physiology of larval and juvenile <i>Utterbackia imbecillis</i> (Bivalvia: Unionidae)
AN  - 304729520
AB  - Larvae of Utterbackia imbecillis normally undergo metamorphosis to the juvenile while attached to the gills or fins of a host fish; however, metamorphosis can also be induced in the laboratory in vitro, in a modified cell culture medium. This study examined the metamorphic period and the juveniles that result from the two rearing conditions. Metamorphosis occurs in 2 stages. The first stage is characterized by the degeneration of the larval adductor muscle and high levels of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. It is also during this stage that the larval mantle cells form a structure known as the mushroom body. These cells possess a system of vacuoles similar to that seen in the digestive cells of many molluscs. These vesicles contain acid phosphatase, a digestive enzyme, and are presumably involved in both intra- and extracellular digestion. In addition, they appear to be storage sites for lipid and glycogen, especially in juveniles reared on their host fish. The second stage of metamorphosis occurs within the last few days before the animals develop into free-living juveniles. This stage is characterized by high levels of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and the development of the juvenile morphology. The present study examined the physiological ecology of juveniles from both rearing techniques. Fish-reared animals possess significantly higher nutrient reserves in the form of triglycerides, cholesterol, and glycogen immediately following metamorphosis, as compared to animals reared in cell culture. In addition, the response of fish-reared juveniles to thermal stress, as measured by protein, RNA, and the RNA:DNA ratio, is similar to that of well-fed animals, while the response of in vitro-reared juveniles more closely resembles starved animals. The results also indicate that not only are fish-reared juveniles more tolerant to thermal and hypoxic stress, but they also grow faster and have higher survivorship than those animals reared in vitro.

T1  - Infrared detection in <i>Melanophila acuminata</i>
AN  - 304720467
AB  - The progression of science has often included mimicry of nature, inherent in which lies the solution of many seemingly insurmountable technical obstacles. One limitation humans have sought to overcome through artificial means is their range of visual sensitivity, which is confined to a small band of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. Nature has given us two biological models for detection of infrared wavelengths: snakes and insects. The insects include Buprestid beetles of the species Melanophila acuminata (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), that can detect infrared radiation emitted from forest fires with bilateral thoracic pit organs. Investigation of the pit organ of  Melanophila beetles may lead to the development of a new class of highly-sensitive detectors that operate at ambient temperatures.    The sensitivity threshold of infrared detection in Melanophila  beetles was established using standard electrophysiological techniques and precise control of radiant flux dosimetry. These experiments determined the distance from which the beetles detect forest fires and pointed to olfaction as the sense responsible for long-range orientation. Moreover, the response characteristics of action and generator potentials recorded from the infrared pit organ were measured. A tunable infrared ultrafast laser was used to measure the spectral sensitivity of the pit organ. The bulk optical and thermal properties of the organ tissue were examined with integrating sphere measurements and scanning probe microscopy, respectively. The material properties together with the action spectrum indicate that the pit organ may utilize its tissue properties specifically to sense wavelengths in the mid-infrared atmospheric window (2–5 μm). Two experiments were designed to provide physical evidence that the beetle infrared pit organ functions via a photo-thermal-mechanical transduction mechanism. In the first mechanism experiment, a fiber-based differential-phase optical low coherence reflectometer was used to measure sub-wavelength displacement of the organ. Although the displacement upon absorption of infrared light is not unique to the organ tissue, the complex morphology of the displacement waveform supports the photo-thermal-mechanical hypothesis. In the second mechanism experiment, the sensitivity as a function of pit organ temperature was measured with electrophysiological techniques. No dependence upon static temperature was found, which indicates that the beetle responds only to rapid temperature changes brought about, for example, by absorption of infrared light by the pit organ. Novel electrode assemblies were designed and built to record an infrared response from the interganglionic connectives in the thorax of the beetle. These electrophysiological experiments verified the conveyance of infrared information through specific pathways to rostrally-situated sites in the nervous system of the beetle.    These experiments were designed to determine the manner in which  Melanophila beetles sense infrared light. Although many questions remain, the information gained may provide suggestions to aid in the development of new solid-state infrared detectors.

T1  - The comparative physiology of fathead minnows and rainbow trout: Insights into the tolerance of the two species to toxicants
AN  - 304718021
AB  - In this thesis the physiological systems of two unrelated freshwater fish with different tolerances to many toxicants were compared. Comparisons were made between fathead minnow (FHM) and rainbow trout (RBT) that were approximately 1.5 g.    Differences between the two species were found in gill function and morphology, detoxification, and cellular resistance. The greater sensitivity of FHM than RBT to H+ ions was related to the fact that FHM appeared to regulate ions with less precision than RBT. There were significant linear relationships between whole body Na+ (r2 0.24) and Cl− (r2 0.33) and temperature as well as with Na+ uptake (r2 0.70) and temperature in FHM after up to 2 months acclimation. In contrast there were no significant relationships between these parameters and temperature in acclimated RBT. In addition, FHM did not up-regulate Na+ uptake even after they had lost up to 31% of whole body Na+ whereas there were 2-fold increases in RBT after whole body Na+ losses of 22%.    The greater tolerance of FHM than RBT to ammonia and organic toxicants was partially attributed to lower gill uptake of these compounds.    The activity rates of the ammonia detoxifying enzyme, glutamine synthetase were 1.7-fold higher in FHM than RBT. Fathead minnows also had 1.7-fold higher activity rates of the phase II biotransformation enzyme, glutathione-s-transferase, than RBT.    Fathead minnows also tolerated higher tissue concentrations of ammonia, and monochlorobenzene than RBT.    Finally, the sprint test was a useful measure of swim performance in both species. The rank order of individual sprint performance was reproducible in FHM (Spearman's rank coefficient (rs 0.95)) and RBT (r s 0.92), and sprint performance was impaired in FHM and RBT with acute exposure to ammonia. However, in FHM sprint performance declined when sprints were repeated at 24 h intervals whereas it was unaffected by this treatment in RBT. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Investigations on the microbial ecology of Yellowstone Lake hydrothermal vents
AN  - 304697644
AB  - Hydrothermal vents situated throughout Yellowstone Lake emit mineral nutrients that may profoundly influence the microbial ecology of the lake. This dissertation presents results from three main lines of inquiry.    First, if nutrient composition and temperature of vent fluids influences the development of nearby microbial communities, then distinct communities of microbes should be detected at different vents. A 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing approach was used to investigate the phylogenetic diversity of Archaea at three geographically- and geochemically contrasting vents. Clones generated from DNA retrieved from a warm water hydrothermal vent showed rRNA gene sequence similarity to Archaea previously found in pedestrian environments, including agricultural soils and freshwater lake sediment. Clones recovered from vents in areas of the lake containing vigorous hydrothermal activity had high sequence similarity to Archaea  earlier recovered from hot water environments, including marine hydrothermal vent systems and terrestrial thermal springs. One clone appears to represent one of only a few known members of the early-diverged  Korarchaea.    Second, if nutrient deprived, but metabolically poised, thiosulfate-oxidizing bacteria are plentiful in Yellowstone Lake bulk water, then chemoautotrophy in bulk water should be stimulated by thiosulfate. The results show that at the sites sampled during this study, vigorous chemoautotrophic activity was limited to hydrothermal vent fluids. Chemoautotrophy was not stimulated by thiosulfate, therefore thiosulfate-oxidizing bacteria may not have been abundant in bulk lake water.    Third, if hydrothermal vent fluids support the growth of a range of metabolic types, including chemoautotrophic and chemoorganotrophic bacteria, then large numbers of these bacteria should be found in vent fluids. The number of cultivable chemoorganotrophic bacteria was significantly higher in vent fluids as compared to bulk water. A representative of the most numerous (as estimated by MPN analysis) chemoorganotrophic bacterium was isolated in pure culture and characterized.    The data suggest Yellowstone Lake hydrothermal vent water is home to various microorganisms, including (i) a diversity of Archaea , (ii) metabolically active chemoautotrophic bacteria, and (iii) metabolically active chemoorganotrophic bacteria.
