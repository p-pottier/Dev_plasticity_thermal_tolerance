#### `Experimental designs`:
*  Experimental_designs.pptx : visual representation of the different types of manipulations of developmental temperature used in the literature
* Static_vs_dynamic_methods : visual representation of dynamic (CTmax) and static (LT50, HKT) designs used to measure thermal tolerance

#### `Manuscript`:
* will contain future manuscript drafts
* Search_methods.docx : description of the methods used to collate the bibliographic data set (these documents are pretty big so they are not shared through Github)

#### `Predictions`:
* Moderators_predictions.docx : table containing the different moderators we will test, the predictions, and their rationale
* Visual_predictions.pptx : visual representation of the predictions

#### `Pre-registration`:
* Study_preregistration_V1.docx : first draft of the preregistration. 

#### `Screening`:
* Conflicts_abstract_screening.docx : word document with details about the conflicts we had during the validation of the abstract screening.
* Conflicts_pilot_100_papers.docx : word document with details about all conflicts we had when screening a random pilot set of 100 publications.
* Decision_trees.pptx : Decision trees used for screening studies
* PRISMA_dev_ctmax.pptx : PRISMA diagram summarising the search methods


#### `Typical papers`:
* Studies excluded: list of papers not matching all our inclusion criteria (see decision trees)
* Studies included : Contains an assemblage of papers testing the effect of incubation temperature on thermal tolerance. The number in the title of the paper corresponds to the type of experimental design used (see Experimental_designs.pptx)
* Studies on knockdown time: list of papers using heat knockdown time as a measure of thermal tolerance. These studies did not necessarily manipulate incubation temperature
* Studies on LT50 : list of papers using LT50 as a measure of thermal tolerance. These studies did not necessarily manipulate incubation temperature
* Studies to discuss : list of papers using uncommon methods. We will need to decide whether or not to include these studies.
