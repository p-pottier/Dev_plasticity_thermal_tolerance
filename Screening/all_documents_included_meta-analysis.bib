	abstract = {Fish actively select an adequate environment that fits their optimum culture/preferred temperature, this mechanism is called thermoregulatory behavior. However, what exactly is this mechanism, how does it work and what can we learn from it? Helped by their thermal limits, fish avoid temperature variations not favorable for their maximum growth. They find a thermal window where optimal temperature culture is located and use it in the best way possible for all activities. The present study is based on thermal biology studies, and its purpose is to learn the aerobic scope functions on Pargo-UNAM juveniles. The importance of this study is related to the fact that Pargo-UNAM fish, being a hybrid, has five different genetic backgrounds. We found that acclimation temperature influenced the preferred temperature of Pargo-UNAM, having a metabolic adjustment in the 20-32ºC range; the Final preferendum obtained was 29.5ºC. The maximum and minimum range of critical thermal limits was between 39.2-43.5ºC and 8-14.9ºC, respectively. The thermal window had an area of 355.2ºC2. The acclimation response ratio had a 0.40-0.35 interval for CTMax, and 0.52-0.69 for CTmin. Chase method used in Pargo-UNAM caused a maximum aerobic scope at 29ºC. Blood lactate concentration was the highest in fish acclimated at 20ºC; these values decreased while acclimation temperature increased. Results from Pargo-UNAM juveniles showed that these can be grown successfully in a 26-32ºC temperature range, with their greater performance at 29ºC, where the aerobic scope was at its maximum capacity. © 2018, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar.

	abstract = {Patagonian red octopus, Enteroctopus megalocyathus, is a merobenthic octopus whose paralarvae have been successfully cultured up to juvenile octopuses. At present, high mortality during the paralarval period prevents the scaling from experimental rearing to commercial aquaculture. The aim of the study was to determine upper (CTMax) and lower (CTMin) thermal tolerance, acclimation response ratio (ARR) and thermal tolerance polygon of paralarvae from different culture conditions and subjected to seven acclimation temperatures (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18°C) during the first 5 days of paralarval life. Culture conditions were two types of egg incubation (maternal care and artificial incubators) and two feeding regimes (fed or starved). Fed paralarvae showed thermal preferendum, while unfed paralarvae preferred much higher temperatures than those of acclimation. CTMin and CTMax increased along with the acclimation temperature. Lower values of ARR were obtained in paralarvae from artificial incubation, with this type of paralarva showing the least adaptability to thermal changes. Starved paralarvae showed the lowest values for thermal tolerance range (TTR) and smaller areas of thermal polygon than fed paralarvae. Rearing temperatures above 16°C may be considered suboptimal to paralarvae and affected by the conditions during the embryonic incubation. Rearing temperatures below 8°C may be considered suboptimal for all hatched paralarvae. Therefore, the other temperatures within this range could be used in the context of improving the culture management of paralarvae. © 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Owing to its potential market value, the blue swimmer crab Portunus pelagicus is of great economic importance. The temperature of water significantly affects the physiological function and production efficiency of these crabs. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the critical thermal minimum (CTMin), critical thermal maximum (CTMax), acclimation response ratio (ARR), escaping temperature (Tesc), and locomotor behavior of P. pelagicus instars at 20 °C, 24 °C, 28 °C, 32 °C, and 36 °C. The CTMax ranged from 39.05 °C to 44.38 °C, while the CTMin ranged from 13.05 °C to 19.30 °C, and both increased directly with temperature. The ARR ranged from 0.25 to 0.51. The movement of crabs (walking before molting) correlated positively with the acclimation temperature. These results indicate that the parameters evaluated varied with temperature. Furthermore, the high CTMax indicates the potential of this species to adapt to a wide range of temperatures. In addition, the implications of these findings for portunid crabs behavior and distribution in their natural habitat are also discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The ability of coldwater species and populations to respond to the predicted temperature increases associated with climate change will largely depend on existing adaptive potential within and among populations. Southern inland populations of Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush are broadly characterized by two ecotypes (small and large bodied) which differ in their trophic ecology, life history traits, and body size. Using common-garden experiments, we investigated population-specific differences in thermal performance (growth, temperature tolerance, and temperature preference) and whether the differences were consistent between ecotypes. We further explored the role of acclimation temperature on growth and thermal performance in two representative ecotypic populations. The evidence from this study indicated that the differences were population specific rather than ecotype specific. A strong inverse relationship between early growth rate and temperature preference suggests that the differences in early growth among Lake Trout populations are driven by adaptive variation in temperature preference. Acclimation temperature had a greater effect than source population on growth and temperature tolerance, although both significantly influenced temperature preferences. Small-bodied ecotypes were less tolerant of elevated temperatures and exhibited less within-population variation, potentially indicating their greater vulnerability to changing ecological conditions under climate change scenarios. © American Fisheries Society 2013.},

	abstract = {The first nuclear power plant of China, Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant (DBNPP), is located on the western shore of subtropical Daya Bay in Guangdong province. The phases one and two began commercial operation in early 1994 and May 2003, respectively. The total capacity of DBNPP is 4 000 megawatt (MW). Currently the power plant discharges thermal waste water into the Daya Bay at a maximum rate of 200m3/s. The effects of discharged thermal water from the DBNPP on the marine organisms and ecological environment have received public attention. The present laboratory study tests the potential impact of the thermal discharge of condenser cooling water on the growth and mortality of two commercially important shrimp species, Penaeus monodon and Metapenaeus affinis. The results indicate that P. monodon and M. affinis have similar suitable growth temperature range of 29°C to 35°C and the same Optimum Growth Temperature (OGT) of 33°C; The Incipient Lethal Temperatures (ILT 50) of P. monodon and M. affinis are 37.5-38.1°C and 38.9-39.3°C, respectively, depending on the acclimation temperature. The Ultimate Incipient Lethal Temperatures (UILT50) of these two shrimp species are 38.1°C and 39.3°C, respectively. The Critical Thermal Maximum (CTM) temperatures are again acclimation temperature dependent and are 42.72-43.60°C and 41.58-43.90°C for P. monodon and M. affinis, respectively. The Maximum Weekly Average Temperatures (MWAT) are 34.7°C and 35.1°C, and the Maximum Temperatures for Short-Term Exposures (MTSTE) are 37.12°C and 37.89°C, respectively, for P. monodon and M. affinis. P. monodon and M. affinis preferred temperatures of 26.4-32.5°C and 30.7-33.1°C, respectively, from the different acclimation temperatures of 25°C to 37°C. The results of our study suggest that at present the direct impact of thermal discharge water from the DBNPP on the growth and/or survivorship of P. monodon and M. affinis is small.},

Temperatures across much of the geographic range of the Whitespotted bamboo shark are rising and it is not immediately clear if the species has the physiological capacity to withstand the impending rise in sea surface temperatures expected by the end of the century. Although listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Near Threatened in 2006, their current conservation status is unknown. Indeed, thermal requirements of elasmobranch fishes in general are grossly understudied with empirical data available for only five of the more than 1200 extant elasmobranch species. The purpose of this study was to quantify thermal niche requirements of the Whitespotted bamboo shark by estimating key thermal metrics including intrinsic tolerance, upper and lower critical temperatures, thermal acclimation range, and upper and lower temperature acclimation responses. The results are interpreted and discussed in relation to current and potential future thermal conditions across the shark’s traditional geographic range.

	abstract = {Red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) are considered one of the most abundant and successful invasive turtle species in the world. Currently, red-eared sliders are known to have reproducing populations on every continent with the exception of Antarctica. In areas where they have become established, red-eared sliders often outcompete, and in some areas extirpate native turtle fauna. A key adaptation recognized in red-eared sliders is their ability to survive a wide range of environmental temperatures. Across their native range, the turtles are noted to survive long-term winter freezing temperatures, as well as prolonged exposure to summer temperature extremes. Although temperature plays an important role in shaping red-eared slider ecology and distribution, relatively little is known about their thermal requirements. This study is the first to use Critical and Chronic Thermal Methodology to define the red-eared slider’s thermal niche. The chronic maximum temperature was 43°C ± 0.3, while the chronic minimum was 18°C ± 0.3. Critical Thermal Maximum increased in correlation to acclimation temperature, 41.8°C ± 0.3 at 15°C, 43.2°C ± 0.3 at 22°C, 44.1°C ± 0.5 at 28°C, and 45.7°C ± 0.2 when acclimated to 35°C. Critical Thermal Minimum also increased in relation to the acclimation temperature, -0.04°C ± 0.3 at 15°C, 2.7°C ± 0.1 at 22°C, 3.3°C ± 0.3 at 28°C, and 5.1°C ± 0.2 when acclimated at 35°C. Using the results of this study, the thermal polygon of red-eared sliders was able to be quantified and paves the way for future thermal studies in this species.},

	abstract = {Acclimation of adult E. chloroticus for 90 days at projected seawater temperature for the next century (i.e., 24 C) resulted in decreased feeding, respiration, negative growth and complete loss of reproductive output. The thermal limits (median lethal temperature (LT50) and lethal temperature) of adult E. chloroticus were not affected by duration of acclimation at 18 and 24 C (i.e., one or four weeks) or by acclimatization summer (21 C) seasons. However, acclimatization of animals to winter season resulted in lower thermal limits. Expression of hsp70 mRNA in adult E. chloroticus increased with temperature during a thermal shock (1 C day-1) with a maximum expression at ca. 27-28 C regardless of the acclimation/acclimatization temperature. Performance of early development at different temperatures (18, 21, 24 C) was evaluated using gametes obtained from acclimated and non-acclimated wild adults. Development was successful in all treatments, and larvae raised at 24 C developed faster and were larger compared to larvae cultured at 18 and 21 C. Culture temperature did not affect respiration rate, lipid and protein content of the gastrulae, 2- and 4-arm larvae. Whereas for the 8-arm larval stage, larvae cultured at 18 C had more lipid compared to those from 24 C, and larvae cultured at 24 C had more protein compared to those from the 18 C treatment. When cultured at 24 C, both gastrula and 2-arm larvae showed higher LT50. Thermal shock had an effect on the hsp70 mRNA expression of gastrulae, 2- and 4-arm larvae. The genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions during early development of E. chloroticus were evident, with some genotypes performing better than others at higher temperatures. In addition, including a second stressor (i.e., low salinity, 29 ppt) during the first 24 hours of development affected fertilization, development rate, gastrulation success and normal development, with seawater temperature only affecting development rate and gastrulation. Nonetheless, an increase in temperature from 18 to 21 C minimized the negative effect of low salinity on development rate and gastrulation of E. chloroticus. Overall, the sea urchin E. chloroticus may have the potential to adapt to warmer seawater conditions induced by climate change due to the presence of developmental plasticity in the early life stages to withstand higher seawater temperatures and lower salinities. However, adaptation would require the presence of competent reproductive adults able to carry on plasticity through generations. Considering the total loss of reproductive output observed at higher temperatures, an increase in seawater temperature could dramatically influence the persistence of northern populations of E. chloroticus, leading to flow-on effects in the subtidal ecosystem. Finally, the results obtained in this research provide detailed information on the physiological and molecular responses of both adults and early life stages of E. chloroticus under current and projected seawater temperatures in a climate change scenario.},

Fish acclimated at 5.3, 10.5, 15.0, or 15.8°C exhibited respective CTMaxima of 24.4, 28.1, 28.0, or 27.0°C, and CTMinima of -3.1, -1.9, 0.6, or -0.4°C. A thermal tolerance polygon from laboratory data revealed an area of 522°C 2—the second smallest measured in a batoid—and a limited acclimation range of 18°C. The thermal niche is dominated by intrinsic tolerance, and a low acclimation response ratio ( 0.3°C per 1°C change in acclimation temperature), limiting little skate acclimation adjustments to no more than 5.5°C. My data suggest that little skates are an obligate cold-water species that may not fare well under warming sea temperatures.},

	abstract = {In regard to global warming, coldwater salmonids are becoming more vulnerable as changing thermal conditions threaten the future sustainability of these species. Thermal stress and habitat loss from increasing water temperatures are expected to impact population viability, particularly for inland populations with limited adaptive resources. Although the long-term persistence of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), an archetypal coldwater salmonid, will depend on their ability to cope with and adapt to changing thermal conditions, very little is known about the scope and variation of thermal tolerances within and among brook trout populations and evolutionary lineages. Demonstrating that brook trout from different ancestral thermal environments vary significantly in their ability to tolerate increasing water temperatures, I found that upper thermal tolerance differs among populations and among acclimation treatments. The northernmost brook trout strain (Lake Nipigon) had the lowest thermal tolerance, while the strain with the most southern ancestry (Hill's Lake) had the greatest thermal tolerance. Standard metabolic rate and critical swimming performance varied similarly across acclimation temperatures, peaking at the upper range of a brook trout's preferred temperature range, then decreasing as temperatures reached pejus points. As well, I investigated a potential physiological mechanism underlying intraspecific differences in thermal tolerance via heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsc70). Heat shock proteins were correlated to thermal tolerance; Hsp70 in cardiac and white muscle tissues were linked, while hepatic tissue showed no correlation. I also attempted to establish whether the heat shock response has equable inter-population coping capacity for protein carbonylation incurred through heat shock. Carbonylation of proteins in white muscle and hepatic tissues was suppressed or repaired, suggesting that heat shock proteins were able to adequately cope with increased oxidative damage due to thermal stress. Taken together, these results suggest that populations of brook trout will vary in their ability to cope with a changing climate.

	abstract = {Insects are ectotherms and have limited ability to regulate body temperature above or below ambient and are consequently greatly affected by temperature. The aphid {\textbackslash}(Myzus{\textbackslash}) {\textbackslash}(persicae{\textbackslash}) has an extensive distribution throughout Europe from Scandinavia to Southern Spain, representing three distinct climatic regions: sub-Arctic, temperate and Mediterranean. The aphid also has genetically distinct clones within its holocyclic (sexual) and anholocyclic (asexual) life cycles. This raises the possibility that aphids are regionally-adapted to distinct climatic zones along the latitudinal cline of its European distribution. Genetically distinct clones of {\textbackslash}(M. persicae{\textbackslash}) were collected from Sweden, UK and Spain. Indices of temperature tolerance (upper and lower lethal temperature50, coma temperatures and mobility thresholds) were determined for each aphid clone at different rearing temperatures. Acclimation at 10°C for one generation increased cold tolerance by depressing lower lethal, chill movement and chill coma temperatures when compared to 20°C and 25°C and further enabled mobility to be maintained to lower temperatures. Acclimation at 25°C for one generation increased heat tolerance by raising upper lethal, heat movement and heat coma temperatures when compared to 10°C and 20°C. Acclimation at 10°C also acted to raise upper lethal temperatures, indicating that the physiological processes conferring heat tolerance are induced at both high and low temperatures. Data did not support intergenerational acclimation to higher or lower temperatures. Lower thermal limits were more plastic than upper limits, enabling tolerance ranges to be increased following acclimation at 10°C, but reduced on acclimation at 25°C. Rates of change varied between clones, suggesting that certain clones could be more affected by climate change. A relationship between thermal tolerance range and latitude was not supported by data on thermal traits investigated with the exception of heat coma temperature. This suggests that clonal mixing across Europe is extensive and prevents local adaptation, although long term populations could persist in the Mediterranean allowing increased heat tolerance. Clonal type, as identified by microsatellite analysis, did show a relationship with thermal tolerance, suggesting that clonal types could respond independently to climate change, affecting relative proportions of clones within populations.},

	abstract = {Gambusia affinis (Baud and Girard), the Western Mosquito fish, a live-bearing species native to the southern United States, is one of the most widespread, introduced species in the world and has a wide thermal tolerance range, surviving 8°C to 40°C. High heat tolerance allows this species to inhabit thermal effluents of power stations where temperatures approach and often exceed its upper thermal limit. Thus, artificially induced natural selection may act on these populations, allowing only thermally tolerant individuals to survive during summer months. Potential influences on thermal tolerance in G. affinis are examined here, including thermal history, dispersal, and the possibility of natural selection on a population of mosquitofish inhabiting the thermal effluent of a power station in Texas. Natural selection is a syllogism with three main components necessary and sufficient for operation: variation among individuals in some phenotypic trait, heritability of that trait, and fitness differences associated with the trait. Thermal tolerance estimates for heated-effluent mosquitofish were 0.6–1.0°C higher than the main-reservoir population after both were acclimated to constant temperature. Second-generation offspring retained ancestral thermal tolerance levels and heritability was estimated to be 69.7\% by regression of mid-parent with mean offspring thermal tolerance. Fitness differences were suggested by measuring mortality over time while holding thermally sensitive and thermally tolerant mosquitofish in enclosures within the heated effluent during mid-summer. Although reproduction was also monitored, no reproduction occurred. Yet, approximately half of the heated-effluent mosquitofish survived when all main-reservoir mosquitofish perished. Evidence was provided that mosquitofish avoid mid-summer temperatures by dispersing into cooler waters within stands of emergent vegetation along the margins of the heated effluent rather than downstream toward the main reservoir. Additionally, thermal history, within the lifetimes of individuals, was found to influence adult thermal tolerance. Exposure temperature change during development was associated with a corresponding change in adult thermal tolerance: mosquitofish exposed to increasing temperatures during development tended to have higher thermal tolerance, while those exposed to decreasing temperatures had lower thermal tolerance. Thus, although environmental factors influence thermal tolerance, all three components required of natural selection were present in this population, strongly suggesting local adaptation of a thermally tolerant race.},

I evaluated effects of temperature, ration level, and genetics on several bioenergetic variables in juvenile California hatchery rainbow trout to test differential responses to temperature hypotheses among four strains: Eagle Lake rainbow trout (O. m. aquilarum), Mt. Shasta strain rainbow trout, little Kern River golden trout (O. m. whitei), and Central Valley steelhead (O. m. irideus). Golden trout food consumption (SCR) and mortality were temperature-independent from 10–22°C but increased at 25°C; growth (SGR) at 10°C was lower than at 14 to 22°C and growth was minimal at 25°C; resting routine oxygen consumption (MO2) was temperature-independent from 10–19°C, but increased at 22°C and subsequently decreased at 25°C; thermal tolerance (CTM) showed a significant thermal acclimation effect, and; swimming performance (Ucrit) was lower at 19°C than at 10 or 14°C. Eagle Lake and Mt. Shasta strain rainbow trout SCR were temperature-independent at 10 to 19°C and increased with temperature from 19 to 25°C; SGR and MO2 increased with temperature to maximum values between 19 and 22°C and declined from 22 to 25°C; CTM was directly correlated with acclimation temperature, and Ucrit, was temperature-independent. Temperature generally affected steelhead SCR, SGR, and CTM but had no effect on resting MO2, Ucrit, or thermal preference (Tp). Ration level (80\% ad lib.) affected steelhead MO2 and SCR, but had no effect on either SGR, CTM, or Tp. The California rainbow trout used in this study have thermal responses reflecting their adaptations to their diverse environments. Similarities among strains were apparent but significant ecophysiological differences among both California and non-California rainbow trout strains and subspecies (from the literature) were also noted.},

	abstract = {Experienced thermal history often affects the temperature tolerance of fish; however, the effect of thermal history on growth performance is unclear. To contribute to effective stocking (release of hatchery-reared juveniles in the field), we conducted four laboratory experiments using juvenile marbled flounder (Pseudopleuronectes yokohamae, around 30 mm standard length and 0.3 g body wet weight) acclimated at 12 °C and 24 °C for approximately 2 weeks to investigate the effects of acclimation temperature on high-temperature tolerance, food consumption, and growth performance. The acclimation to 24 °C increased tolerance to high temperatures, as shown in a 24-h exposure experiment and in a temperature elevation experiment. The 50\% lethal temperature (upper incipient lethal temperature) was estimated to be 25.9 °C and 29.0 °C for the 12 °C and 24 °C acclimation groups, respectively. In subsequent experiments, we tested the effects of high and low temperature acclimation on the food consumption and growth performance of two size groups of juveniles (28.7 ± 2.0 and 34.5 ± 2.9 mm, mean ± SD), that were reared at temperatures ranging from 14 °C to 23 °C. The optimal temperature for growth was 20 °C and did not differ between the acclimation temperatures or between the size groups. However, food consumption and growth performance were suppressed by acute temperature changes. Specifically, feeding and growth were lower in the 24 °C-acclimated group than in the 12 °C-acclimated group when exposed to 14 °C, which is close to the natural water temperature at release in the field. These results suggest that experienced thermal history does not affect the optimal temperature but can affect the growth performance of juveniles. To maximize the post-release growth of hatchery-reared juveniles, the influence of thermal history should be taken into consideration and acute thermal changes before release should be avoided. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Many species with broad distributions are exposed to different thermal regimes which often select for varied phenotypes. This intraspecific variation is often overlooked but may be critical in dictating the vulnerability of different populations to environmental change. We reared Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) eggs from two thermally discrete populations (i.e. Jervis Bay and Adelaide) under each location's present-day mean temperatures, predicted end-of-century temperatures and under reciprocal-cross conditions to establish intraspecific thermal sensitivity. Rearing temperatures strongly influenced ṀO2Max and critical thermal limits, regardless of population, indicative of acclimation processes. However, there were significant population-level effects, such that Jervis Bay sharks, regardless of rearing temperature, did not exhibit differences in ṀO2Rest, but under elevated temperatures exhibited reduced maximum swimming activity with step-wise increases in temperature. In contrast, Adelaide sharks reared under elevated temperatures doubled their ṀO2Rest, relative to their present-day temperature counterparts; however, maximum swimming activity was not influenced. With respect to reciprocal-cross comparisons, few differences were detected between Jervis Bay and Adelaide sharks reared under ambient Jervis Bay temperatures. Similarly, juveniles (from both populations) reared under Adelaide conditions had similar thermal limits and swimming activity (maximum volitional velocity and distance) to each other, indicative of conserved acclimation capacity. However, under Adelaide temperatures, the ṀO2Rest of Jervis Bay sharks was greater than that of Adelaide sharks. This indicates that the energetics of cooler water population (Adelaide) is likely more thermally sensitive than that of the warmer population (Jervis Bay). While unique to elasmobranchs, these data provide further support that by treating species as static, homogeneous populations, we ignore the impacts of thermal history and intraspecific variation on thermal sensitivity. With climate change, intraspecific variation will manifest as populations move, demographics change or extirpations occur, starting with the most sensitive populations. © 2020 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Global warming is predicted to increase both acute and prolonged thermal challenges for aquatic ectotherms. Severe short- and medium-term thermal stress over hours to days may cause mortality, while longer sub-lethal thermal challenges may cause performance declines. The inter-relationship between the responses to short, medium and longer thermal challenges is unresolved. We asked if the same individuals are tolerant to both rapid and slow warming challenges, a question that has so far received little attention. Additionally, we investigated the possibility of a thermal syndrome where individuals in a population are distributed along a warm-type to cold-type axis. We tested whether different thermal traits correlate across individuals by acclimating 200 juvenile zebrafish (Danio rerio) to sub- or supra-optimal temperatures for growth (22 and 34°C) for 40 days and measuring growth and thermal tolerance at two different warming rates. We found that tolerance to rapid warming correlated with tolerance to slow warming in the 22°C treatment. However, individual tolerance to neither rapid nor slow warming correlated with growth at the supra-optimal temperature. We thus find some support for a syndrome-like organisation of thermal traits, but the lack of connection between tolerance and growth performance indicates a restricted generality of a thermal syndrome. The results suggest that tolerance to rapid warming may share underlying physiological mechanisms with tolerance to slower heating, and indicate that the relevance of acute critical thermal tolerance extends beyond the rapid ramping rates used to measure them. © 2020.

For organisms with short generation times, seasonal variation is experienced across, rather than within, generations. How this affects the seasonal evolution of thermal tolerance and phenotypic plasticity is understudied, but has direct implications for the thermal ecology of these organisms. Here we document intra-annual patterns of thermal tolerance in two species of Acartia copepods (Crustacea) from a highly seasonal estuary, showing strong variation across the annual temperature cycle. Common garden, split-brood experiments indicate that this seasonal variation in thermal tolerance, along with seasonal variation in body size and phenotypic plasticity, is likely affected by genetic polymorphism.

	abstract = {Elevated temperatures resulting from climate change are expected to disproportionately affect ectotherms given their biological function has a direct link to environmental temperature. Thus, as climate change leads to rapid increases in water temperatures in rivers, aquatic ectotherms, such as fish may be highly impacted. Organisms can respond to these stressors through flexible and rapid phenotypic change induced via developmental and/or transgenerational plasticity. In oviparous species, gravid females may translate environmental stress across generations via increased exposure of eggs to maternally derived glucocorticoids (i.e., maternal stress), which has been shown to result in diverse phenotypic effects in offspring. Recent studies suggest these phenotypic changes from maternal glucocorticoids may elicit predictive adaptive responses, where offspring exposed to maternal stress may be better prepared for the stressful environment they will encounter (i.e., environmental match hypothesis). We applied the environmental match hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal exogenous increase in egg cortisol may prepare Chinook salmon offspring (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to cope with thermal challenges after being reared in chronically elevated temperatures. Specifically, we exposed eggs to aqueous bath of cortisol-dosed (1,000 ng/mL) or control (0 ng/ml) solutions, and then raised both treatments at current (+0°C—contemporary ambient river temperature) or elevated (+3°C—projected future river temperature) thermal regimes. We quantified thermal performance in fish 7–9 month post fertilization using two methods: via critical thermal maximum (CTMax), and energetic responses (in plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate) to environmentally relevant, but challenging thermal spikes over 3 days. Overall, we found that exposure to elevated rearing temperatures had a large impact on thermal tolerance, where elevated-temperature reared offspring had significantly higher CTMax. In comparison, egg cortisol treatment had little to no clear effects on CTMax and blood energetic response. Our study demonstrates the importance of elevated water temperatures as an inducer of offspring phenotypes (via early developmental cues), and highlights the significance of examining offspring performance in environments with ecologically relevant stressors. © Copyright © 2020 Warriner, Semeniuk, Pitcher, Heath and Love.},

Significantly decreased CTmax of the fish was found at 36 °C compared to 30 °C and 33 °C. The fish in the highest (36 °C) temperature were found with significantly lower Hb and RBC content and significantly higher WBC and blood glucose levels than that of the fishes in the lowest (30 °C) temperature both at the start and end points. The highest frequencies of ENAs and ECAs were found in the highest (36 °C) temperature group compared to the lowest (30 °C) temperature group at both the points. We also evaluated growth performance of the rohu fingerlings reared in the three temperatures for 60 days. The growth parameters - final weight gain, percent weight gain and specific growth rate were the highest at 33 °C and the lowest at 36 °C. The present study revealed that the highest temperature (36 °C) tested here may be hazardous to rohu and the temperature should be kept below 36 °C in the aquaculture setting to avoid physiological damage and growth and production loss to the fish. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

For this purpose, tolerable temperature ranges of juvenile gilthead seabream acclimated at 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C for 30 days were estimated using dynamic and static thermal methodologies. The SMRs of the fish were also determined based on oxygen consumption rate (OCR). The dynamic and static thermal tolerance zones of gilthead seabream were calculated as 737 °C2 and 500 °C2, respectively, with a resistance zone area of 155.5 °C2. The SMR of the fish at the above acclimation temperatures (AT) was determined as 138, 257, 510, and 797 mg O2 h−1 kg−1, respectively and were significantly different (P \&lt; 0.01, n = 10). The temperature quotient (Q10) in relation to the SMR of the fish was calculated as 3.45, 3.91, and 2.44 for acclimation temperature ranges of 15–20, 20–25, and 25–30 °C, respectively. The fact that the SMR increased with rising temperatures and then decreased gradually after 25 °C indicates that the temperature preference of juvenile gilthead seabream lies between 25 and 30 °C. This study shows that gilthead seabream tolerates a relatively narrow temperature range, and consequently, a low capacity for acclimatisation to survive in aquatic systems characterised by temperature variations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Using laboratory experiments we reconstructed the thermal performance curves (TPCurves) of larval life history (survival, growth, and development rates) and larval heat tolerance (CTmax) across two recent range expansions from the core populations in southern France toward a warmer (southeastern Spain) and a cooler (northwestern Spain) region in Europe by the damselfly Ischnura elegans. First-generation larvae from field-collected mothers were reared across a range of temperatures (16°–28°C) in incubators. The range expansion to the warmer region was associated with the evolution of a greater ability to cope with high temperatures (increased mean and thermal plasticity of CTmax), faster development, and, in part, a faster growth, indicating a higher time constraints caused by a shorter time frame available for larval development associated with a transition to a greater voltinism. Our results thereby support the emerging pattern that plasticity in heat tolerance alone is inadequate to adapt to new thermal regimes. The range expansion to the cooler region was associated with faster growth indicating countergradient variation without a change in CTmax. The evolution of a faster growth rate during both range expansions could be explained by a greater digestive efficiency rather than an increased food intake. Our results highlight that range expansions to warmer and cooler regions can result in similar evolutionary changes in the TPCurves for life history, and no opposite changes in heat tolerance. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America},

	abstract = {An organism's thermal limits provide valuable insights into species distributions and potential climate change impacts. The critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in particular has been widely used for among-species analyses of thermal tolerances. However, CTmax measurements can depend on important context-dependencies, including acclimation temperature and experimental procedure. We investigated acclimation effects on CTmax in two amphibian species commonly used as laboratory models, Ambystoma mexicanum (Axolotls) and Xenopus laevis (African Clawed Frogs), using the standard dynamic method. Both species exhibited an increased CTmax following acclimation to a warm temperature (24°C) relative to cold acclimation (8°C). We also found that warm-temperature acclimation resulted in significant mass losses in both species, possibly reflecting metabolic costs of living at higher temperatures. Our CTmax measurements for A. mexicanum were consistent with CTmax measurements for closely related salamander species, but CTmax measurements for cold-acclimated X. laevis were inconsistent with a prior study of this species. This might have been because of the earlier study employing a less common curve-fitting method to estimate CTmax. These results highlight the importance of accounting for recent acclimation temperatures when estimating amphibian thermal limits and provide further support for the generalization that most amphibian species exhibit increased CTmax following warm-temperature acclimation. © 2020 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.},

	abstract = {Rising temperatures are set to imperil freshwater fishes as climate change ensues unless compensatory strategies are employed. However, the presence of additional stressors, such as elevated nitrate concentrations, may affect the efficacy of compensatory responses. Here, juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) were exposed to current-day summer temperatures (28°C) or a future climate-warming scenario (32°C) and simultaneously exposed to one of three ecologically relevant nitrate concentrations (0, 50 or 100 mg l-1). We measured indicators of fish performance (growth, swimming), aerobic scope (AS) and upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) to test the hypothesis that nitrate exposure would increase susceptibility to elevated temperatures and limit thermal compensatory responses. After 8 weeks of acclimation, the thermal sensitivity and plasticity of AS and swimming performance were tested at three test temperatures (28, 32, 36°C). The AS of 28°C-acclimated fish declined with increasing temperature, and the effect was more pronounced in nitrate-exposed individuals. In these fish, declines in AS corresponded with poorer swimming performance and a 0.8°C decrease in CTmax compared with unexposed fish. In contrast, acclimation to 32°C masked the effects of nitrate; fish acclimated to 32°C displayed a thermally insensitive phenotype whereby locomotor performance remained unchanged, AS was maintained and CTmax was increased by ∼1°C irrespective of nitrate treatment compared with fish acclimated to 28°C. However, growth was markedly reduced in 32°C-acclimated compared with 28°C-acclimated fish. Our results indicate that nitrate exposure increases the susceptibility of fish to acute high temperatures, but thermal compensation can override some of these potentially detrimental effects. © 2020.

	abstract = {The fitness consequences of thermal plasticity of functional traits of insects, and the life stages at which these responses manifest, remain a subject of much debate. Here, we examine whether a short-term exposure to cold, medium or warm fluctuating temperature regimes during development (larval or adult) affects adult performance, thermal tolerance and fitness of the globally invasive harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis. We found plastic responses of a metric of heat stress resistance—critical thermal maximum—and of preferred body temperature after adult temperature exposure, but not in other traits measured. By contrast, exposure of larval stages resulted in plasticity of adult walking performance (height and breadth of the curve) but not tolerance or preference. We found distinct fitness responses between larval and adult treatments, but a composite fitness index revealed negligible effects on reproductive output. These results suggest that the drivers underlying the plasticity of temperature tolerance and temperature selection are different to those shaping the plasticity of walking speed. By testing specific predictions based on current theory of developmental and reversible plasticity, this study contributes novel data to plastic responses of behaviour, stress resistance and fitness to temperature exposure across life stages and thus, provides insights to the broader evolutionary and ecological significance of these responses. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Marine ectotherms are often sensitive to thermal stress, and certain life stages can be particularly vulnerable (e.g., larvae or spawners). In this study, we investigated the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of larval and early juvenile life stages of three tropical marine fishes (Acanthochromis polyacanthus, Amphiprion melanopus, and Lates calcarifer). We tested for potential effects of developmental acclimation, life stage, and experimental heating rates, and we measured metabolic enzyme activities from aerobic (citrate synthase, CS) and anaerobic pathways (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH). A slightly elevated rearing temperature neither influenced CTmax nor CS activity, which otherwise could have indicated thermal acclimation. However, we found CTmax to either remain stable (Acanthrochromis polyacanthus) or increase with body mass during early ontogeny (Amphiprion melanopus and Lates calcarifer). In all three species, faster heating rates lead to higher CTmax. Acute temperature stress did not change CS or LDH activities, suggesting that overall aerobic and anaerobic metabolism remained stable. Lates calcarifer, a catadromous species that migrates from oceanic to riverine habitats upon metamorphosis, had higher CTmax than the two coral reef fish species. We highlight that, for obtaining conservative estimates of a fish species’ upper thermal limits, several developmental stages and body mass ranges should be examined. Moreover, upper thermal limits should be assessed using standardized heating rates.

	abstract = {Environmental stress induced by natural and anthropogenic processes including climate change may threaten the productivity of species and persistence of populations. Ectotherms can potentially cope with stressful conditions such as extremes in temperature by exhibiting physiological plasticity. Amphibian larvae experiencing stressful environments display altered thyroid hormone (TH) status with potential implications for physiological traits and acclimation capacity. We investigated how developmental temperature (Tdev) and altered TH levels (simulating proximate effects of environmental stress) influence the standard metabolic rate (SMR), body condition (BC), and thermal tolerance in metamorphic and post-metamorphic anuran larvae of the common frog (Rana temporaria) reared at five constant temperatures (14–28 °C). At metamorphosis, larvae that developed at higher temperatures had higher maximum thermal limits but narrower ranges in thermal tolerance. Mean CTmax was 37.63 °C ± 0.14 (low TH), 36.49 °C ± 0.31 (control), and 36.43 °C ± 0.68 (high TH) in larvae acclimated to different temperatures. Larvae were able to acclimate to higher Tdev by adjusting their thermal tolerance, but not their SMR, and this effect was not impaired by altered TH levels. BC was reduced by 80\% (metamorphic) and by 85\% (post-metamorphic) at highest Tdev. The effect of stressful larval conditions (i.e., different developmental temperatures and, to some extent, altered TH levels) on SMR and particularly on BC at the onset of metamorphosis was carried over to froglets at the end of metamorphic climax. This has far reaching consequences, since body condition at metamorphosis is known to determine metamorphic success and, thus, is indirectly linked to individual fitness in later life stages. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The red sea urchin Mesocentrotus franciscanus supports a highly valuable wild fishery along the West Coast of North America, but despite its importance in the ecology of kelp forests and as a harvested species, little is known about how M. franciscanus responds to abiotic stressors associated with ocean warming and acidification during its early development. Here, embryos of M. franciscanus were raised under combinations of two temperatures (13 °C and 17 °C) and two pCO2 levels (475 μatm and 1050 μatm) that represent current and future coastal environments. Elevated pCO2 levels led to a decrease in body size of gastrula stage embryos while temperature had no effect. At the prism stage, both temperature and pCO2 affected body size. The warmer temperature increased the body size of prism stage embryos, offsetting the stunting effect of elevated pCO2 on growth. Thermal tolerance, which was estimated by exposing prism stage embryos to a range of temperatures and estimating the survivorship, was found to be slightly higher in those raised under warmer temperatures. The developmental temperature and pCO2 conditions under which embryos were raised did not have an effect on the metabolic rate as measured by oxygen consumption rate at the prism stage. This study provides important insights into a species of high ecological and economic value. Overall, early development under elevated pCO2 conditions may adversely impact M. franciscanus while moderate warming may improve growth and thermal tolerance. Understanding how fishery species respond to abiotic stressors will facilitate our predictive capacity of how climate change will impact future populations, which links to issues such as sustainability and food security. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Climate warming has increased the frequency of extreme heat events. Alien species usually invade new areas with a low-density population and often have limited mating opportunities due to the unsynchronized emergence of adults. Early-emerging virgin adults often have to wait to mate with later-emerging partners at the cost of aging, which reduces thermal tolerance. To understand the adaptive strategies of virgin males/females versus those of mated males/females in response to heat stress during aging, we conducted a fully factorial experiment to test the basal and plastic heat tolerance (CTmax, critical thermal maximum) of males and females with different mating statuses (virgin and mated) at different ages (5, 10, and 15 days after eclosion) after different acclimation regimes (null, rapid and developmental heat acclimation) in a well-known invasive species, Drosophila suzukii. We found that mating could change the heat tolerance of adults during aging. Mated females had higher basal heat tolerance than virgin females, while mated males had lower tolerance than virgin males. Mating could generally decrease the acclimation capacity (i.e., plasticity of heat tolerance) during aging. Aged virgin adults had a much higher acclimation capacity than aged mated adults. Our findings suggest that phenotypic plasticity of heat tolerance may be a main strategy used by virgin adults to cope with heat events. The phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerance could increase the invasion success of alien species in new areas by allowing them to rapid respond to local temperature changes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ectotherms are susceptible to increasing environmental temperatures associated with anthropogenic warming. Supra-optimum temperatures lead to declining aerobic capacity and can increase exposure to lethal temperatures, resulting in reduced performance. Although the capacity of phenotypic plasticity to minimize the effects of temperature on physiological processes is well studied, evidence of generational changes (e.g. transgenerational plasticity and rapid adaptation) in response to environmental warming is limited in natural populations. We investigated metabolism, growth, and thermal tolerance of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) populations inhabiting thermally altered lakes (i.e. power plant cooling lakes) which have year-round elevated temperature regimes and exhibit supra-optimum temperatures on a yearly basis, and compared these traits with those in largemouth bass populations from ambient lakes. Largemouth bass from ambient and heated groups (n = 3 populations per group) were spawned in an ambient, common garden pond environment, then acclimated to either a normal summertime temperature (24 °C) or a supra-optimum temperature (30 °C). Fish from heated populations had significant reductions in the resting metabolic rate at both temperatures and markedly increased growth rates at 30 °C. By comparing pond-raised fish to fish removed directly from heated lakes, we showed that developmental plasticity played little role in establishing the metabolic rate. A lower resting metabolic rate contributed to an increase in the conversion efficiency of food to biomass of largemouth bass from heated lakes, regardless of temperature. Despite inhabiting heated lakes for many decades, neither critical thermal maximum nor minimum were altered in heated populations when raised in a common garden environment. These results suggest that largemouth bass can lessen sub-lethal effects of warming by altering physiological processes to reduce the impact of warming on aerobic scope and that these changes are generationally transient, but changes in maximum thermal tolerance in response to warming is limited to phenotypic plasticity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

All four measured physiological variables (righting time, resting metabolic rate, critical thermal minimum and critical thermal maximum) were significantly affected by temperature acclimation.

By 2050, climate change may result in temperature increases of 2.1-3.4°C in Manitoba, Canada. Lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, from both northern and southern populations in Manitoba were acclimated to 16, 20 and 24°C for 30 days, after which critical thermal maximum (CTmax) trials were conducted to investigate their thermal plasticity. We also examined the effects of temperature on morphological and physiological indices. Acclimation temperature significantly influenced the CTmax, body mass, hepatosomatic index, metabolic rate and the mRNA expression of transcripts involved in the cellular response to heat shock and hypoxia (HSP70, HSP90a, HSP90b, HIF-1α) in the gill of lake sturgeon. Population significantly affected the above phenotypes, as well as the mRNA expression of Na+/K+ ATPase-α1 and the hepatic glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity. The southern population had an average CTmax that was 0.71 and 0.45°C higher than the northern population at 20 and 24°C, respectively. Immediately following CTmax trials, mRNA expression of HSP90a and HIF-1α was positively correlated with individual CTmax of lake sturgeon across acclimation treatments and populations (r = 0.7, r = 0.62, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). Lake sturgeon acclimated to 20 and 24°C had decreased hepatosomatic indices (93 and 244\% reduction, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001) and metabolic suppression (27.7 and 42.1\% reduction, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05) when compared to sturgeon acclimated to 16°C, regardless of population. Glutathione peroxidase activity and mRNA expression Na+/K+ ATPase-α1 were elevated in the northern relative to the southern population. Acclimation to 24°C also induced mortality in both populations when compared to sturgeon acclimated to 16 and 20°C. Thus, increased temperatures have wide-ranging population-specific physiological consequences for lake sturgeon across biological levels of organization. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Extreme heat events are becoming more common as a result of anthropogenic global change. Developmental plasticity in physiological thermal limits could help mitigate the consequences of thermal extremes, but data on the effects of early temperature exposure on thermal limits later in life are rare, especially for vertebrate ectotherms. We conducted an experiment that to our knowledge is the first to isolate the effect of egg (i.e. embryonic) thermal conditions on adult heat tolerance in a reptile. Eggs of the lizard Anolis sagrei were incubated under one of three fluctuating thermal regimes that mimicked natural nest environments and differed in mean and maximum temperatures. After emergence, all hatchlings were raised under common garden conditions until reproductive maturity, at which point heat tolerance was measured. Egg mortality was highest in the warmest treatment, and hatchlings from the warmest treatment tended to have greater mortality than those from the cooler treatments. Despite evidence that incubation temperatures were stressful, we found no evidence that incubation treatment influenced adult heat tolerance. Our results are consistent with a low capacity for organisms to increase their physiological heat tolerance via plasticity, and emphasize the importance of behavioural and evolutionary processes as mechanisms of resilience to extreme heat. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Many studies document genetic and phenotypic trait changes of species in response to climate change, or document how evolution of individual species can impact population abundances and community composition. An integration of population and community-level responses requires, however, a multiple species approach. Here we quantify among- and within-species differences in thermal tolerance and life-history traits in three co-occurring Daphnia species upon exposure to a naturally occurring heat wave. Populations of randomly isolated clones of Daphnia magna, Daphnia pulicaria, and Daphnia galeata from the same pond were exposed to a natural heat wave in outdoor mesocosms. We subsequently conducted a common garden experiment in the laboratory using clonal lineages isolated at the end of the mesocosm selection experiment, at two rearing temperatures, measuring thermal tolerance and life-history traits. We find pronounced plasticity responses to higher rearing thermal regime in each study species. We observe only few significant microevolutionary responses involving evolution of plasticity in D. pulicaria. Yet in terms of effect size, evolutionary trait change within species contributes more than 25\% to total trait change in response to the heat wave for a majority of the trait × species combinations. The relative importance of intraspecific to interspecific variation varies widely among traits. Our results show that the relative importance of interspecific variation, phenotypic plasticity, and evolutionary trait change differs strongly depending on the set of species and traits studied. Taking into account this variation at different levels of biological organization is important to predict community-wide responses to global change. © 2020 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography},

	abstract = {Background: Producing high quality sterile males is vital in Aedes aegypti rear-and-release birth control strategies. Larval diets, rearing temperatures, and their interactions determine the accumulation rates of essential nutrients in larvae, but these factors have been understudied in relation to mass-rearing techniques for producing eminent males. Methods: We compared the effects of two larval diets, a cereal-legume-based diet (Khan's diet) and a standard larval diet developed in the FAO/IAEA Insect Pest Control Laboratory (IAEA 2 diet). Diets were tested at selected temperatures for both larval and male adult life history traits, adult extreme temperature tolerance, and mating capacity relative to energy reserves of reared male adult Ae. aegypti. Results: Khan's diet resulted in shorter immature development time at each test temperature (except for 25 °C) than an IAEA 2 diet. Larvae reared at 28 °C and 32 °C with Khan's diet demonstrated low pupation rates (c.80\%). We accounted for these phenomena as secondary sex ratio manipulation, because a higher proportion of male adults emerged at 28 °C and 32 °C than that for the IAEA 2 diet. In general, the pupal development time shortened as temperature increased, resulting in higher teneral energy reserves in male mosquitoes. High energy reserves allowed male mosquitoes reared with Khan's diet to have higher adult longevity (5-6 days longer when sugar-fed and 2-3 days longer when water-fed) and tolerance of heat stress than those fed on the IAEA 2 diet. The IAEA 2 diet produced larger male mosquitoes than Khan's diet did: mosquitoes fed on Khan's diet were 1.03-1.05 times smaller than those fed on the IAEA 2 diet at 28 °C and 32 °C. No evidence indicated reduced mating capacity for small mosquitoes fed on Khan's diet. Conclusions: Larvae reared at 28 °C and 32 °C with Khan's diet were characterized by shorter immature development time compared with those fed on the IAEA 2 diet. Adult mosquitoes produced from that larval rearing condition exhibited a significant male bias, long lifespan, and better endurance against extreme temperatures relative to energy reserves. Thus, the larval diet at rearing temperature of 28 °C and 32 °C optimized rearing techniques for the sterile insect programmes. However, mating competitiveness and flight performance of adult males require further investigation. © 2019 The Author(s).},

Artificial stock enhancement was applied to rebuild the natural population of S. younghusbandi in recent years. However, the optimal growth temperature and thermal tolerance of S. younghusbandi has not been studied, which restricts the production of S. younghusbandi fingerling for stock enhancement. The purpose of this paper is to determine the growth, critical thermal maximum (CTMax), lethal thermal maximum (LTMax) and acclimation response ratio (ARR) of S. younghusbandi juveniles (body weight 5.7 ± 1.2 g) at three acclimation temperature levels (10, 15, 20°C). The results showed that acclimation temperature significantly affected the growth, CTMax, LTMax and ARR of the experimental fish. Largest final weight (7.5 ± 2.3 g) was recorded in 15°C group. At a heating rate of 1°C/30 min, CTMax ranged from 30.98 to 32.01°C and LTMax ranged from 31.76 to 32.31°C in the three acclimation temperatures. Schizopygopsis younghusbandi had lower ARR value (0.097) than most other fish species. Low ARR value indicates that S. younghusbandi may have narrower thermal tolerance range and weaker acclimation ability to global warming. For successful aquaculture of S. younghusbandi juveniles, temperature should be maintained around 15°C. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

	abstract = {Differences in population vulnerability to warming are defined by spatial patterns in thermal adaptation. These patterns may be driven by natural selection over spatial environmental gradients, but can also be shaped by gene flow, especially in marine taxa with high dispersal potential. Understanding and predicting organismal responses to warming requires disentangling the opposing effects of selection and gene flow. We begin by documenting genetic divergence of thermal tolerance and developmental phenotypic plasticity. Ten populations of the widespread copepod Acartia tonsa were collected from sites across a large thermal gradient, ranging from the Florida Keys to Northern New Brunswick, Canada (spanning over 20° latitude). Thermal performance curves (TPCs) from common garden experiments revealed local adaptation at the sampling range extremes, with thermal tolerance increasing at low latitudes and decreasing at high latitudes. The opposite pattern was observed in phenotypic plasticity, which was strongest at high latitudes. No relationship was observed between phenotypic plasticity and environmental variables. Instead, the results are consistent with the hypothesis of a trade-off between thermal tolerance and the strength of phenotypic plasticity. Over a large portion of the sampled range, however, we observed a remarkable lack of differentiation of TPCs. To examine whether this lack of divergence is the result of selection for a generalist performance curve or constraint by gene flow, we analyzed cytochrome oxidase I mtDNA sequences, which revealed four distinct genetic clades, abundant genetic diversity, and widely distributed haplotypes. Strong divergence in thermal performance within genetic clades, however, suggests that the pace of thermal adaptation can be relatively rapid. The combined insight from the laboratory physiological experiments and genetic data indicate that gene flow constrains differentiation of TPCs. This balance between gene flow and selection has implications for patterns of vulnerability to warming. Taking both genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity into account, our results suggest that local adaptation does not increase vulnerability to warming, and that low-latitude populations in general may be more vulnerable to predicted temperature change over the next century. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

While fish thermotolerance has been demonstrated to be plastic, the downstream impacts of early life-stage high temperature exposure are not known. In the present study, we investigated the thermotolerance of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fry 2 months after being exposed to elevated temperature (22°C) for 96 h. Exposed fry demonstrated a reduced critical thermal maxima (CTmax) in comparison to control fish. Using the RNase H-dependent quantitative PCR method, expression of rainbow trout hsp70 isoforms was determined immediately after the acute thermal stress and immediately following the thermotolerance trials. The lowered CTmax was associated with a reduced ability to upregulate the hsp70b gene during the thermotolerance trials, whereas no changes in hsp70a were observed. Overall, these results indicate that exposure to thermal stress in early life-stages of rainbow trout can have negative effects on future physiological function. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia and climate warming are pervasive stressors in aquatic systems that may have interactive effects on fishes because both affect aerobic metabolism. We explored independent and interactive effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature on thermal tolerance, behavior, and fitness-related traits of juvenile F1 offspring of the African cichlid Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor. Fish were reared in a split-brood design with four treatments (low or high DO, cool or hot temperature); thermal tolerance, growth, and condition were measured after 1 mo in the rearing treatments, following which behavioral traits were measured over 3.6 mo. Critical thermal maximum was higher in fish reared under hot conditions but was not affected by hypoxia. There was an interactive effect of DO and temperature on agitation temperature (temperature at which fish show behavioral signs of thermal stress) and the thermal agitation window (°C between the onset of agitation and final loss of equilibrium). Fish reared and tested under hot, normoxic conditions showed a higher agitation temperature, while fish reared and tested under hot, hypoxic conditions showed the largest thermal agitation window. Fish grew more quickly in length under hot than cool conditions and more quickly under normoxic than hypoxic conditions. Fish reared under cool, normoxic conditions were characterized by higher condition than other groups. Both cool and hypoxic rearing conditions reduced activity and aggression.

	abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important environmental factors affecting the physiological activities and, thus, the fitness of fish, and physiological studies can help predict the effects of climate change on fish species in the field. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acclimation temperature on the thermal tolerance, hypoxia tolerance and swimming ability of two endangered fish species in the upper reach of the Yangtze River, namely, the Chinese sucker (Myxocyprinus asiaticus) and rock carp (Procypris rabaudi). The fish were acclimated at either 15 °C or 25 °C for a 3-week period. Then, thermal tolerance as indicated by the critical thermal maximum (CT max ) and critical thermal minimum (CT min ), hypoxia tolerance as indicated by the aquatic surface respiration (ASR 50 ) and loss of equilibrium (LOE 50 ), swimming performance as indicated by the critical swimming speed (U crit ), aerobic capacity as indicated by the maximum metabolic rate and aerobic scope were measured. As expected, the thermal indicators of both species increased with temperature, and their values at both acclimation temperatures were similar to those of fish living in the Yangtze River. However, both species showed poor hypoxia tolerance compared to most fish species in the Yangtze River, according to previous studies. In particular, Chinese sucker acclimated at a low temperature exhibited an unusually strong decrease in hypoxia tolerance with decreasing temperature (fish usually showed high hypoxia tolerance due to decreased oxygen demand and high environmental oxygen tension at low temperature). Furthermore, Chinese sucker exhibited poorer swimming performance than rock carp (which is also a relatively poor swimmer among the fish species in the Yangtze River) when maintained at a high temperature due to low swimming efficiency, possibly as a consequence of its deep body shape. The difference in U crit was magnified at low temperature due to the more profound decrease in metabolic scope in Chinese sucker than in rock carp (55\% vs 20\%), but Chinese sucker showed a higher resting metabolic rate than rock carp at a low temperature, which is difficult to explain. This result suggested that low hypoxia tolerance and poor swimming performance due to the low cardiorespiratory capacity and (or) non-streamlined body shape of both fish species, especially Chinese sucker, reared at low temperature might be two of the reasons why they are not well adjusted to the change in their natural habitat and have thus declined in recent decades. The underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved in the unusual adjustment of the physiological function of Chinese sucker and its ecological relevance must be investigated further. The present study provides a good example of a physiological investigation yielding very interesting and useful data for species conservation in a changing world. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Climate change is increasingly exposing populations to rare and novel environmental conditions. Theory suggests that extreme conditions will expose cryptic phenotypes, with a concomitant increase in trait variation. Although some empirical support for this exists, it is also well established that physiological mechanisms (e.g. heat shock protein expression) change when organisms are exposed to constant versus fluctuating temperatures. To determine the effect of common, rare and novel temperatures on the release of hidden variation, we exposed fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, to five fluctuating and four constant temperature regimes (constant treatments: 23.5, 25, 28.5 and 318C; all fluctuating treatments shared a minimum temperature of 228C at 00.00 and a maximum of 25, 28, 31, 34 or 378C at 12.00). We measured each individual’s length weekly over 60 days, critical thermal maximum (CT max ), five morphometric traits (eye anterior–posterior distance, pelvic fin length, pectoral fin length, pelvic fin ray count and pectoral fin ray count) and fluctuating asymmetry (FA, absolute difference between left and right morphometric measurements; FA is typically associated with stress). Length-at-age in both constant and fluctuating conditions decreased with temperature, and this trait’s variance decreased with temperature under fluctuating conditions but increased and then decreased in constant temperatures. CT max in both treatments increased with increasing water temperature, while its variance decreased in warmer waters. No consistent pattern in mean or variance was found across morphometric traits or FA. Our results suggest that, for fathead minnows, variance can decrease in important traits (e.g. length-at-age and CT max ) as the environment becomes more stressful, so it may be difficult to establish comprehensive rules for the effects of rarer or stressful environments on trait variation. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Predicting the response of populations to climate change requires an understanding of how various factors affect thermal performance. Genetic differentiation is well known to affect thermal performance, but the effects of sex and developmental phenotypic plasticity often go uncharacterized. We used common garden experiments to test for effects of local adaptation, developmental phenotypic plasticity and individual sex on thermal performance of the ubiquitous copepod, Acartia tonsa (Calanoida, Crustacea) from two populations strongly differing in thermal regimes (Florida and Connecticut, USA). Females had higher thermal tolerance than males in both populations, while the Florida population had higher thermal tolerance compared with the Connecticut population. An effect of developmental phenotypic plasticity on thermal tolerance was observed only in the Connecticut population. Our results show clearly that thermal performance is affected by complex interactions of the three tested variables. Ignoring sex-specific differences in thermal performance may result in a severe underestimation of population-level impacts of warming because of population decline due to sperm limitation. Furthermore, despite having a higher thermal tolerance, low-latitude populations may be more vulnerable to warming as they lack the ability to respond to increases in temperature through phenotypic plasticity. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {The thermal physiological performance of invasive species may play a crucial role in determining their invasion success. In this study, we acclimated two cohorts of hatchlings of freshwater turtles (native Mauremys reevesii and invasive Trachemys scripta elegans) from low and high-latitude collection sites, respectively, to different thermal conditions (20 and 30 °C) for 4 weeks, and then compared their thermal tolerance and locomotor performance. T. scripta elegans hatchlings could swim faster (but righted themselves more slowly), and tolerate a higher temperature and wider temperature range than M. reevesii hatchlings. Similarly, T. scripta elegans hatchlings had a greater maximal performance (P max ) value for swimming speed (but a lower P max value for righting time) than M. reevesii hatchlings. Temperature acclimation had a significant impact on the thermal tolerance and locomotor ability of turtles, but the acclimation effect did not differ between the two species. T. scripta elegans hatchlings seemed to have a greater thermal plasticity than M. reevesii hatchlings. High-latitude individuals showed a greater low-temperature tolerance, but lower locomotor ability (longer righting time) than low-latitude ones. However, the thermal plasticity did not differ between latitudinal cohorts. Our results indicated that T. scripta elegans performed better than M. reevesii, which might contribute to its range expansion and invasive success. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Limited food availability and altered thermal regimes (e.g. cold water releases from dams) are two common stressors threatening the persistence of fishes inhabiting anthropogenically disturbed freshwater systems. Yet, the combined effects of these stressors remain poorly characterised. To remedy this, we examined the isolated and combined effects of low temperature exposure and food restriction on specific growth rate (SGR, \% body mass/day) and upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) in larval white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus [Acipenseridae], 32 days post-hatch, body mass: 0.25 ± 0.03 g, mean ± standard deviation). A 2 × 2 factorial design was implemented with fish exposed to one of two ecologically-relevant acclimation temperatures (cold exposure: 11°C or a control temperature: 18°C) and one of two food restriction treatments designed to emulate observed declines in food availability (100\% or 40\% optimal feed rate) for 6 weeks (N: 3 replicate tanks/treatment, 50 fish/tank). Specific growth rate was affected by both low temperature exposure and food restriction in isolation; low temperature exposure reduced SGR by 56.5\% and food restriction reduced SGR by 30.6\%. Simultaneous exposure to low temperature and food restriction resulted in a greater but less than additive reduction in SGR (80.6\%), indicating that the stressors interacted antagonistically. Critical thermal maxima were c. 2°C higher in 18°C-acclimated fish (CTMax = 30.7 ± 0.4°C, mean ± standard error) compared to 11°C-acclimated fish (CTMax = 28.6 ± 0.2°C, mean ± standard error); however, CTMax was independent of food restriction in both 11°C- and 18°C-acclimated fish. These data highlight the unpredictability of stressor interactions and may guide holistic conservation strategies, which target co-occurring stressors in freshwater habitats. © 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Organisms often experience adverse high temperatures during the daytime, but they may also recover or repair themselves during the night-time when temperatures are more moderate. Thermal effects of daily fluctuating temperatures may thus be divided into two opposite processes (i.e. negative effects of daytime heat stress and positive effects of night-time recovery). Despite recent progress on the consequences of increased daily temperature variability, the independent and combined effects of daytime and night-time temperatures on organism performance remain unclear. By independently manipulating daily maximum and minimum temperatures, we tested how changes in daytime heat stress and night-time recovery affect development, survival and heat tolerance of the lady beetle species Propylea japonica. Thermal effects on development and survival differed between daytime and night-time. Daytime high temperatures had negative effects whereas night-time mild temperatures had positive effects. The extent of daytime heat stress and night-time recovery also affected development and critical thermal maximum, which indicates that there were both independent and combined effects of daytime and night-time temperatures on thermal performances. Our findings provide insight into the thermal effect of day-to-night temperature variability and have important implications for predicting the impacts of diel asymmetric warming under climate change. © 2019.

	abstract = {In response to environmental change, organisms rely on both genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to adjust key traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction. Given the accelerating rate of climate change, plasticity may be particularly important. For organisms in warming aquatic habitats, upper thermal tolerance is likely to be a key trait, and many organisms express plasticity in this trait in response to developmental or adulthood temperatures. Although plasticity at one life stage may influence plasticity at another life stage, relatively little is known about this possibility for thermal tolerance. Here, we used locally adapted populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus to investigate these potential effects in an intertidal ectotherm. We found that low latitude populations had greater critical thermal maxima (CTmax) than high latitude populations, and variation in developmental temperature altered CTmax plasticity in adults. After development at 25°C, CTmax was plastic in adults, whereas no adulthood plasticity in this trait was observed after development at 20°C. This pattern was identical across four populations, suggesting that local thermal adaptation has not shaped this effect among these populations. Differences in the capacities to maintain ATP synthesis rates and to induce heat shock proteins at high temperatures, two likely mechanisms of local adaptation in this species, were consistent with changes in CTmax owing to phenotypic plasticity, which suggests that there is likely mechanistic overlap between the effects of plasticity and adaptation. Together, these results indicate that developmental effects may have substantial impacts on upper thermal tolerance plasticity in adult ectotherms. © 2019.

	abstract = {Marine heatwaves, which are increasing in frequency, duration and intensity owing to climate change, are an imminent threat to marine ecosystems. On coral reefs, heatwave conditions often coincide with periods of peak recruitment of juvenile fishes and exposure to elevated temperature may affect their development. However, whether differences in the duration of high temperature exposure have effects on individual performance is unknown. We exposed juvenile spiny damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, to increasing lengths of time (3, 7, 30 and 108 days post-hatching) of elevated temperature (+2°C). After 108 days, we measured escape performance at present-day control and elevated temperatures, standard length, mass and critical thermal maximum. Using a Bayesian approach, we show that 30 days or more exposure to +2°C leads to improved escape performance, irrespective of performance temperature, possibly owing to developmental effects of high temperature on muscle development and/or anaerobic metabolism. Continued exposure to elevated temperature for 108 days caused a reduction in body size compared with the control, but not in fish exposed to high temperature for 30 days or less. By contrast, exposure to elevated temperatures for any length of time had no effect on critical thermal maximum, which, combined with previous work, suggests a short-term physiological constraint of ∼37°C in this species. Our study shows that extended exposure to increased temperature can affect the development of juvenile fishes, with potential immediate and future consequences for individual performance. © 2019.

We found that all the environmental variables strongly influenced survival, K, ED and CTmax. Fish reared in elevated temperature showed higher mortality and reduced K pre-winter at 127 days post-hatch (dph). Interestingly, we did not find any significant difference in terms of metabolic rate between treatments at both sampling points of pre- and post-winter. Long-term exposure to 80\% DO reduced ED in Lake Sturgeon post-winter at 272 dph. Our data suggest that substrate should be removed at the onset of exogenous feeding to enhance the survival rate of age-0 Lake Sturgeon in the first year of life.

	abstract = {The developmental environment has significant immediate effects on phenotypes, but it may also persistently or permanently shape phenotypes across life history. This study examined how developmental temperature influenced embryonic and larval phenotypes of Baja California chorus frog (Pseudacris hypochondriaca), an abundant amphibian in southern California and northern Baja California. We collected egg clutches from native ponds in northern San Diego County within 24 h of fertilization, and clutches were separated and distributed between constant temperatures of 10, 15, 20, and 25°C for incubation. Oxygen consumption rate (V.O2), developmental stage, and embryo and yolk masses were measured throughout development. Time to 50\% hatch, survival at 50\% hatch, and hatch duration were determined. Development rate was strongly affected by temperature, with warmer temperatures reducing time to hatch and hatch duration. Survival to hatch was high across all temperatures, 90\% Mass-specific V.O2of embryos either remained constant or increased throughout development, and by hatching energy demand was significantly increased at higher temperatures. There were limited temperature effects on growth, with embryo and yolk dry mass similar between temperatures throughout embryonic development. To examine long-Term effects of embryonic temperature, we reared hatchlings from each temperature until onset of larval feeding. Once feeding, larvae were acclimated to 20 or 25°C (2 weeks). Following acclimation to 20 or 25°C, we measured larval mass-specific V.O2 and critical thermal maximum (CTMax) at a common developmental stage (Gosner stages 32-36, "hindlimb toe differentiation"). Embryonic temperature had persistent effects on larval V.O2and CTMax, with warmer temperatures generally resulting in similar or higher V.O2 and CTMax. This partially supported a "warmer is better" effect of embryonic incubation temperature. These results suggest that in a thermally robust amphibian species, temperature may program the phenotype during early development to construct traits in thermal tolerance and energy use that may persist. Overall, P. hypochondriaca displays a thermally robust phenotype, and it is possible that amphibians that possess a wider range of phenotypic plasticity will be relatively more successful mitigating effects of climate change. © 2019 Mueller, Bucsky, Korito and Manzanares.},

	abstract = {Heatwaves are a regular occurrence in Australia, and are predicted to increase in intensity and duration in the future. These changes may elevate temperatures inside lizard nests, shortening the incubation period, so that hatchlings are more likely to emerge during heatwaves. Potentially, developmental plasticity or heat hardening could buffer hatchings from future warming. For example, higher incubation temperatures could shift critical thermal maxima upwards, enabling lizards to withstand higher temperatures. To investigate whether developmental plasticity affects hatchling thermal tolerance, we incubated eggs of the velvet gecko Amalosia lesueurii under two fluctuating incubation treatments to mimic current (mean=24.3°C, range 18.4-31.1°C) and future 'hot' (mean=28.9°C, range 19.1-38.1°C) nest temperatures. We maintained the hatchlings under identical conditions, and measured their thermal tolerance (CTmax) aged 14 days and 42 days. We then released hatchlings at field sites, and recaptured individually marked lizards aged 6 months, to determine whether incubation induced shifts in thermal tolerance were transitory or long-lasting. We found that at age 14 days, hatchlings from hot-temperature incubation had higher CTmax [mean=39.96±0.25°C (s.d.)] than hatchlings from current-temperature incubation [mean=39.70±0.36°C (s.d.)]. Hatchlings from the current-incubation treatment also had significantly higher heat hardening capacity [mean=0.79±0.37°C (s.d.)] than hatchlings from hot-temperature incubation treatment [mean=0.47± 0.17°C (s.d.)]. However, both of these incubation-induced effects did not persist into later life. By contrast, incubation treatment had significant and long-lasting effects on the cold tolerance of hatchlings. At age 14 days, current-incubated hatchlings tolerated colder temperatures [CTmin= 11.24±0.41°C (s.d.)] betterthan hot-incubated hatchlings [CTmin=14.11± 0.25°C (s.d.)]. This significant difference in cold tolerance persisted into the juvenile life stage, and was present in 6-month-old lizards that we recaptured from field sites. This finding indicates that upward shifts in cold tolerance caused by higher incubation temperatures might affect overwinter survival of lizards, but field studies linking fitness to thermal tolerance are necessary to test this idea. Overall, our results suggest that developmental plasticity for heat tolerance is unlikely to buffer lizard populations from higher temperatures. © 2019. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

	abstract = {Early life stages of salmonids are particularly vulnerable to warming and hypoxia, which are common stressors in hyporheic, gravel bed, rearing habitat (i.e. a 'redd'). With the progression of global climate change, high temperatures and hypoxia may co-occur more frequently within redds, particularly for salmonid species at their southern range limit. Warming and hypoxia have competing effects on energy supply and demand, which can be detrimental to energy-limited early life stages. We examined how elevated temperature and hypoxia as individual and combined stressors affected the survival, physiological performance, growth, and development of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We reared late fall-run Chinook salmon from fertilization to the fry stage in a fully factorial design of two temperatures [10°C (ambient) and 14°C (warm)] and two oxygen levels [normoxia (100\% air saturation, 10 mg O2/l) and hypoxia (50\% saturation, 5.5 mg O2/l)]. Rearing in hypoxia significantly reduced hatching success, especially in combination with warming. Both warming and hypoxia improved acute thermal tolerance. While rearing in hypoxia improved tolerance to acute hypoxia stress, warming reduced hypoxia tolerance. Hypoxia-reared fish were smaller at hatch, but were able to reach similar sizes to the normoxia-reared fish by the fry stage. High temperature and normoxia resulted in the fastest rate of development while low temperature and hypoxia resulted in the slowest rate of development. Despite improved physiological tolerance to acute heat and hypoxia stress, hypoxia-reared embryos had reduced survival and growth, which could have larger population-level effects. These results suggest that both warming and hypoxia are important factors to address in conservation strategies for Chinook salmon. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The important information derived from this study revealed that the upper thermal limits of adults are constrained to a relative narrow range that will make them sensitive to relative small changes in temperatures, whilst all mean upper thermal indices at 35 °C were significantly higher than at 25 °C for nymphs. For this highlight notice, nymphs have more potential to change their upper thermal limits which will allow them to withstand high temperatures in the field.

	abstract = {Lepidopteran stemborers are the most destructive insect pests of cereal crops in sub-Saharan Africa. In nature, these insects are often exposed to multiple environmental stressors, resulting in potent impact on their thermal tolerance. Such environmental stressors may influence their activity, survival, abundance and biogeography. In the present study, we investigate the effects of acclimation to temperature, starvation and desiccation on thermal tolerance, measured as critical thermal limits [critical thermal minima (CTmin) and maxima (CTmax)] on laboratory-reared economic pest species Chilo partellus Swinhoe (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), Busseola fusca (Fuller) and Sesamia calamistis Hampson (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) using established protocols. Low temperature acclimation results in improved CTmin for B. fusca and C. partellus, whereas high temperature acclimation enhances the same trait for B. fusca and S. calamistis. Similarly, high temperature and starvation pretreatment improve CTmax for C. partellus relative to S. calamistis and B. fusca. In addition, starvation and desiccation pretreatments improve CTmin for all stemborer species. Furthermore, rapid cold-hardening (RCH) enhancs CTmin for B. fusca and C. partellus, whereas rapid heat-hardening (RHH) improves the same trait for C. partellus. However, RCH and RHH impair CTmax for all stemborer species. These findings show differential thermal tolerances after exposure to heterogeneous environmental stress habitats. Chilo partellus, of exotic origin, shows a higher magnitude of basal thermal tolerance plasticity relative to the indigenous African species S. calamistis and B. fusca. This indicates that C. partellus may have a fitness and survival advantage under climate-induced heterogeneous environments, and also have a greater chance for geographical range expansion and invasion success compared with the indigenous B. fusca and S. calamistis. © 2018 The Royal Entomological Society},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing climatic average temperatures and variability elicit various insect physiological responses that affect fitness and survival and may influence subsequent trophic interactions in agroecosystems. In this background, we investigated short- and long-term plastic responses to temperature of the laboratory-reared stemborer Chilo partellus and its larval endoparasitoid Cotesia flavipes. RESULTS: Rapid cold- and heat-hardening effects in C. partellus larvae, pupae and adults and C. flavipes adults were highly significant (P {\textless} 0.001). High-temperature acclimation improved critical thermal limits and heat knockdown time in C. partellus larvae and C. flavipes adults, respectively. Low-temperature acclimation enhanced the supercooling point in C. flavipes and the chill coma recovery time in both C. partellus larvae and C. flavipes adults. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that thermal plasticity may enhance the survival of these two species when they are subjected to lethal low and high temperatures. However, C. partellus appeared to be more plastic than C. flavipes. These results have three major implications: (1) C. partellus may inhabit slightly warmer environments than C. flavipes, suggesting a potential mismatch in biogeography; (2) host–parasitoid relationships are complex and are probably trait dependent, and (3) host–parasitoid differential thermal plastic responses may offset biocontrol efficacy. These results may help inform biocontrol decision making under conditions of global change. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {To predict the impact of pesticides in a warming world we need to know how species differ in the interaction pathways between pesticides and warming. Trait-based approaches have been successful in identifying the ‘pace of life’ and body size as predictors of sensitivity to pesticides among distantly related species. However, it remains to be tested whether these traits allow predicting differences in sensitivity to pesticides between closely related species, and in the strength of the interaction pathways between pesticides and warming. We tested the effects of multiple pulses of chlorpyrifos (allowing accumulation) under warming on key life history traits, heat tolerance (CTmax) and physiology of two congeneric damselfly species: the fast-paced (fast growth and development, high metabolic rate), small Ischnura pumilio and the slow-paced, large I. elegans. Chlorpyrifos reduced survival and growth, but contrary to current trait-based predictions I. pumilio was 8 × less sensitive than I. elegans. The lower sensitivity of I. pumilio could be explained by a higher fat content, and higher activities of acetylcholinesterase and of detoxifying and anti-oxidant enzymes. While for I. pumilio the effect of chlorpyrifos was small and did not depend on temperature, for I. elegans the impact was higher at 20 °C compared to 24 °C. This matches the higher pesticide accumulation in the water after multiple pulses at 20 °C than at 24 °C. The expected reduction in heat tolerance after pesticide exposure was present in I. elegans but not in I. pumilio. Our results demonstrate that closely related species can have very different sensitivities to a pesticide resulting in species-specific support for the “toxicant-induced climate change sensitivity” and the “climate-induced toxicant sensitivity” interaction pathways. Our results highlight that trait-based approaches can be strengthened by integrating physiological traits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms that underlie thermal tolerance in aquatic ectotherms remain unresolved. Triploid fish have been reported to exhibit lower thermal tolerance than diploids, offering a potential model organism to better understand the physiological drivers of thermal tolerance. Here, we compared triploid and diploid juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in freshwater to investigate the proposed link between aerobic capacity and thermal tolerance. We measured specific growth rates (SGR) and resting (aerobic) metabolic rates (RMR) in freshwater at 3, 7 and 9 weeks of acclimation to 10, 14 and 18°C. Additionally, maximum metabolic rates (MMR) were measured at 3 and 7 weeks of acclimation, and critical thermal maxima (CTmax) were measured at 9 weeks. Mass, SGR and RMR differed between ploidies across all temperatures at the beginning of the acclimation period, but all three metrics were similar across ploidies by week 7. Aerobic scope (MMR-RMR) remained consistent across ploidies, acclimation temperatures and time. At 9 weeks, CTmax was independent of ploidy, but correlated positively with acclimation temperature despite the similar aerobic scope between acclimation groups. Our findings suggest that acute thermal tolerance is not modulated by aerobic scope, and the altered genome of triploid Atlantic salmon does not translate to reduced thermal tolerance of juvenile fish in freshwater. © 2018.

	abstract = {A species’ thermal sensitivity and its exposure to climate variation are key components in the prediction of its vulnerability to climate change. We tested the thermal sensitivity of a tropical amphibian that lives in a mild constant climate in which the thermal tolerance range is expected to closely match the experienced environmental temperature. The air temperature that this species is exposed to varies between 21.9 and 31.6°C with an annual mean of 27.2°C. We estimated the microhabitat water temperature variation under vegetation shade, which buffers the temperature by 1.8°C in relation to that of the air, and with open canopy, where the water was 1.9°C warmer than the air temperature. With broods of tadpoles split into five treatments (15°C, 21°C, 28°C, 31°C, and 33°C), we estimated the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and critical thermal minimum (CTMin) after at least 7 days of acclimation. Both CTMax (42.3°C) and CTMin (11.8°C) were more extreme than the temperature range estimated for the field. We estimated the optimum temperature (To = 28.8°C) and the thermal performance breadth (range: 23.3–34.1°C) based on growth rate (g/day). The animals were able to acclimate more extensively to cold than to warm temperatures. These performance curve traits closely matched the air temperature. The estimated vulnerability varied according to the microhabitat prediction model used. The combination of tadpole data on thermal sensitivity and macro- and microhabitat variation provides a necessary framework to understand the effects of climate change on tropical amphibians. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation},

	abstract = {There is increasing concern that standard laboratory toxicity tests may be misleading when assessing the impact of toxicants, because they lack ecological realism. Both warming and biotic interactions have been identified to magnify the effects of toxicants. Moreover, while biotic interactions may change the impact of toxicants, toxicants may also change the impact of biotic interactions. However, studies looking at the impact of biotic interactions on the toxicity of pesticides and vice versa under warming are very scarce. Therefore, we tested how warming (+4 °C), intraspecific competition (density treatment) and exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos, both in isolation and in combination, affected mortality, cannibalism, growth and heat tolerance of low- and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Moreover, we addressed whether toxicant exposure, potentially in interaction with competition and warming, increased the frequency of autotomy, a widespread antipredator mechanism. Competition increased the toxicity of chlorpyrifos and made it become lethal. Cannibalism was not affected by chlorpyrifos but increased at high density and under warming. Chlorpyrifos reduced heat tolerance but only when competition was high. This is the first demonstration that a biotic interaction can be a major determinant of ‘toxicant-induced climate change sensitivity’. Competition enhanced the impact of chlorpyrifos under warming for high-latitude larvae, leading to an increase in autotomy which reduces fitness in the long term. This points to a novel pathway how transient pesticide pulses may cause delayed effects on populations in a warming world. Our results highlight that the interplay between biotic interactions and toxicants have a strong relevance for ecological risk assessment in a warming polluted world. Intraspecific competition increases the impact of an organophosphate pesticide under warming by increasing the amount of autotomy and by reducing heat tolerance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {To evaluate whether oxygen-carrying capacity influences thermal tolerance in fishes, we reared four Chinook salmon families in present-day (+0°C) and possible future (+4°C) temperatures and assessed the response of hematocrit (Hct) to acute temperature stress. In the +4°C treatment, Hct increased above control levels when juvenile fish were exposed to their critical thermal maximum (CTmax). Conversely, no effect of temperature stress on Hct was found in the +0°C treatment. Hct was positively associated with CTmax(r2p 0:12; n p 66), contributing to the CTmaxof the +4°C treatment being significantly higher than that of the +0°C treatment (mean ± SD, 26° ± 0:6°C and 25° ± 0:5°C, respectively). The association between CTmaxand Hct found here supports the hypothesis that thermal tolerance is affected by oxygen supply to tissue.

	abstract = {Environmental variation induced by natural and anthropogenic processes including climate change may threaten species by causing environmental stress. Anuran larvae experiencing environmental stress may display altered thyroid hormone (TH) status with potential implications for physiological traits. Therefore, any capacity to adapt to environmental changes through plastic responses provides a key to determining species vulnerability to environmental variation. We investigated whether developmental temperature (Tdev), altered TH levels and whether the interactive effect of both affect standard metabolic rate (SMR), body condition (BC), survival and thermal tolerance in larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) reared at five temperatures with experimentally altered TH levels. At metamorphosis, SMR, BC and survival were significantly affected by Tdev, TH status and their interaction with the latter often intensified impacts. Larvae developing at warmer temperatures exhibited significantly higher SMRs and BC was reduced at warm Tdev and high TH levels suggesting decreased ability to acclimate to variation in temperature. Accordingly, tadpoles that developed at warm temperatures had higher maximum thermal limits but more narrow thermal tolerance windows. High and low TH levels decreased and increased upper thermal limits, respectively. Thus, when experiencing both warmer temperatures and environmental stress, larvae may be less able to compensate for changes in Tdev. Our results demonstrate that physiological traits in larvae of X. laevis are strongly affected by increased TH levels and warmer temperatures. Altered TH levels and increasing Tdev due to global change may result in a reduced capacity for physiological plasticity. This has far reaching consequences since the energetic requirement at the onset of metamorphosis is known to determine metamorphic success and thus, is indirectly linked to individual fitness in later life stages. © The Author(s) 2018.

Adaptive phenotypic responses induced by heterogeneous temperatures have been shown to be mediated by molecular pathways independent of the classic heat shock responses; however, an in-depth understanding of plasticity induced by fluctuating temperatures is still lacking. We investigated high and low temperature acclimation induced by fluctuating thermal regimes at two different mean temperatures, at two different amplitudes of fluctuation and across the developmental and adult life stages of Drosophila melanogaster. For developmental acclimation, we found mildly detrimental effects of high-amplitude fluctuations for critical thermal minima, while the critical thermal maxima showed a beneficial response to higher amplitude fluctuations. For adult acclimation involving shifts between fluctuating and constant regimes, cold tolerance was shown to be dictated by developmental temperature conditions irrespective of the adult treatments, while the acquired heat tolerance was readily lost when flies developed at fluctuating temperature were shifted to a constant regime as adults. Interestingly, we also found that the effect of fluctuations at any life stage was gradually lost with prolonged adult maintenance, suggesting a more prominent effect of fluctuations during developmental compared with adult acclimation in D. melanogaster. © 2017.

The preference was determined through acute preferred temperature. Maximum critical temperature and mean lethal temperature allowed to estimate thermal tolerance. The results show that acclimation temperatures higher than 14°C increase both thermal preference and tolerance. However, individuals acclimatized to 22°C preferred temperatures lower than their acclimation. In addition, thermal tolerance was identical between individuals acclimatized at 17°C and 22°C.

	abstract = {Most of the thermal tolerance studies on fish have been performed on juveniles and adults, whereas limited information is available for larvae, a stage which may have a particularly narrow range in tolerable temperatures. Moreover, previous studies on thermal limits for marine and freshwater fish larvae (53 studies reviewed here) applied a wide range of methodologies (e.g. the static or dynamic method, different exposure times), making it challenging to compare across taxa. We measured the Critical Thermal Maximum (CTmax) of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae using the dynamic method (ramping assay) and assessed the effect of warming rate (0.5 to 9°C h-1) and acclimation temperature. The larvae of herring had a lower CTmax (lowest and highest values among 222 individual larvae, 13.1–27.0°C) than seabass (lowest and highest values among 90 individual larvae, 24.2–34.3°C). At faster rates of warming, larval CTmax significantly increased in herring, whereas no effect was observed in seabass. Higher acclimation temperatures led to higher CTmax in herring larvae (2.7 ± 0.9°C increase) with increases more pronounced at lower warming rates. Pre-trials testing the effects of warming rate are recommended. Our results for these two temperate marine fishes suggest using a warming rate of 3–6°C h-1: CTmax is highest in trials of relatively short duration, as has been suggested for larger fish. Additionally, time-dependent thermal tolerance was observed in herring larvae, where a difference of up to 8°C was observed in the upper thermal limit between a 0.5- or 24-h exposure to temperatures \&gt;18°C. The present study constitutes a first step towards a standard protocol for measuring thermal tolerance in larval fish. © 2017 Moyano et al.

Hotter summers could result in higher temperatures inside lizard nests, potentially exposing embryos to thermally stressful conditions during development. Potentially, developmentally plastic shifts in thermal tolerance could allow lizards to adapt to climate warming. To determine how higher nest temperatures affect the thermal tolerance of hatchling geckos, we incubated eggs of the rock-dwelling velvet gecko, Amalosia lesueurii, at two fluctuating temperature regimes to mimic current nest temperatures (mean 23.2°C, range 10-33°C, 'cold') and future nest temperatures (mean 27.0°C, range 14-37°C, 'hot'). Hatchlings from the hot incubation group hatched 27 days earlier and had a lower critical thermal maximum (CTmax 38.7°C) and a higher critical thermal minimum (CTmin 6.2°C) than hatchlings from cold incubation group (40.2 and 5.7°C, respectively). In the field, hatchlings typically settle under rocks near communal nests. During the hatching period, rock temperatures ranged from 13 to 59°C, and regularly exceeded the CTmax of both hot- and cold-incubated hatchlings. Because rock temperatures were so high, the heat tolerance of lizards had little effect on their ability to exploit rocks as retreat sites. Instead, the timing of hatching dictated whether lizards could exploit rocks as retreat sites; that is, cold-incubated lizards that hatched later encountered less thermally stressful environments than earlier hatching hot-incubated lizards. In conclusion, we found no evidence that CTmax can shift upwards in response to higher incubation temperatures, suggesting that hotter summers may increase the vulnerability of lizards to climate warming. © 2017.

	abstract = {Understanding how populations adapt to heterogeneous thermal regimes is essential for comprehending how latitudinal gradients in species diversification are formed, and how taxa will respond to ongoing climate change. Adaptation can occur by innate genetic factors, by phenotypic plasticity, or by a combination of both mechanisms. Yet, the relative contribution of such mechanisms to large-scale latitudinal gradients of thermal tolerance across conspecific populations remains unclear. We examine thermal performance in 11 populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus, ranging from Baja California Sur (Mexico) to British Columbia (Canada). Common garden experiments show that survivorship to acute heat-stress differs between populations (by up to 3.8°C in LD50 values), reflecting a strong genetic thermal adaptation. Using a split-brood experiment with two rearing temperatures, we also show that developmental phenotypic plasticity is beneficial to thermal tolerance (by up to 1.3°C), and that this effect differs across populations. Although genetic divergence in heat tolerance strongly correlates with latitude and temperature, differences in the plastic response do not. In the context of climate warming, our results confirm the general prediction that low-latitude populations aremost susceptible to local extinction because genetic adaptation has placed physiological limits closer to current environmental maxima, but our results also contradict the prediction that phenotypic plasticity is constrained at lower latitudes. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Global warming and chemical pollution are key anthropogenic stressors with the potential to interact. While warming can change the impact of pollutants and pollutants can change the sensitivity to warming, both interaction pathways have never been integrated in a single experiment. Therefore, we tested the effects of warming and multiple pesticide pulses (allowing accumulation) of chlorpyrifos on upper thermal tolerance (CTmax) and associated physiological traits related to aerobic/anaerobic energy production in the damselfly Ischnura elegans. To also assess the role of latitude-specific thermal adaptation in shaping the impact of warming and pesticide exposure on thermal tolerance, we exposed larvae from replicated high- and low-latitude populations to the pesticide in a common garden rearing experiment at 20 and 24 °C, the mean summer water temperatures at high and low latitudes. As expected, exposure to chlorpyrifos resulted in a lower CTmax. Yet, this pesticide effect on CTmax was lower at 24 °C compared to 20 °C because of a lower accumulation of chlorpyrifos in the medium at 24 °C. The effects on CTmax could partly be explained by reduction of the aerobic scope. Given that these effects did not differ between latitudes, gradual thermal evolution is not expected to counteract the negative effect of the pesticide on thermal tolerance. By for the first time integrating both interaction pathways we were not only able to provide support for both of them, but more importantly demonstrate that they can directly affect each other. Indeed, the warming-induced reduction in pesticide impact generated a lower pesticide-induced climate change sensitivity (in terms of decreased upper thermal tolerance). Our results indicate that, assuming no increase in pesticide input, global warming might reduce the negative effect of multiple pulse exposures to pesticides on sensitivity to elevated temperatures. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The seahorse Hippocampus erectus inhabits estuaries and coastal areas from southern Canada to northern Brazil, including the Yucatan Peninsula (YP), Mexico. Fish species living in thermally heterogeneous environments have developed physiological and behavioural adjustments that provide individuals with the phenotypic plasticity to respond to environmental changes within certain limits. When thermal changes exceed the ability of fish to adjust, energy supply is predominantly directed to fuel essential maintenance costs at the expense of growth and reproduction. In such circumstances, not only temperature, but also time of exposure, are elements that determine the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity. The present study was designed to examine the consequences of acclimation of juvenile H. erectus to 18 and 30 °C on the phenotypic plasticity associated with exposure to acute thermal events (measured through the thermal limits) and chronic exposure during longer periods (measured through growth). Similar survival and growth was found in all seahorses that experienced acute exposure ( 1 min) to temperatures ranging from 7 to 33 °C and 12 to 36 °C in both acclimation treatments, respectively. Chronic exposure to 30 °C compared to 18 °C, however, significantly reduced seahorse growth. A thermal tolerance polygon calculated as 302 °C2 suggests that H. erectus has a wide tolerance to the extreme conditions commonly present in estuarine environments. Given that the amplitude in the thermal tolerance polygon was mainly due to an increase in the lower limits of the interval and that no minimum temperature threshold could be determined, thus suggesting that the populations from YP are near their upper thermal limit. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The ability of insects to cope with stressful temperatures through adaptive plasticity has allowed them to thrive under a wide range of thermal conditions. Developmental plasticity is generally considered to be a non-reversible phenotypic change, e.g. in morphological traits, while adult acclimation responses are often considered to be reversible physiological responses. However, physiologically mediated thermal acclimation might not follow this general prediction. We investigated the magnitude and rate of reversibility of developmental thermal plasticity responses in heat and cold tolerance of adult flies, using a full factorial design with two developmental and two adult temperatures (15 and 25C). We show that cold tolerance attained during development is readily adjusted to the prevailing conditions during adult acclimation, with a symmetric rate of decrease or increase. In contrast, heat tolerance is only partly reversible during acclimation and is thus constrained by the temperature during development. The effect of adult acclimation on heat tolerance was asymmetrical, with a general loss of heat tolerance with age. Surprisingly, the decline in adult heat tolerance at 25C was decelerated in flies developed at low temperatures. This result was supported by correlated responses in two senescenceassociated traits and in accordance with a lower rate of ageing after low temperature development, suggesting that physiological age is not reset at eclosion. The results have profound ecological consequences for populations, as optimal developmental temperatures will be dependent on the thermal conditions faced in the adult stage and the age at which they occur. © 2016.

Brief (2 h) heat shocks at temperatures of 35°C and above significantly increased CTmax relative to control temperatures (25°C). Increasing mean temperatures (from 25 to 30°C) or greater diurnal fluctuations (from constant to ±10°C) during larval development also significantly increased CTmax. Combining these data showed that repeated or continuous temperature exposure during development improved heat tolerance beyond the effects of a single exposure to the same maximum temperature.

Warming reduced the survival of 30-day-old larvae by half. Length at hatching increased with temperature as expected, but no significant effect was observed on the length and growth at 30 days post-hatching. Warming did not significantly affect the thermal tolerance of sardine larvae, even though the mean lethal temperature increased by 1°C. In the warm conditions, sardine larvae showed signs of thermal stress, indicated by a pronounced increase in larval metabolism (Q10 = 7.9) and a 45\% increase in the heat shock response. Lipid peroxidation was not significantly affected by the higher temperature, even though the mean value doubled. Warming did not affect the time larvae spent swimming, but decreased by 36\% the frequency of prey attacks.

The fish were subjected to a stepwise temperature change at a rate of 1. °C/h increasing or decreasing from 25. °C (the control) to six target temperatures (12, 13, 15, 20, 28 and 32. °C) respectively, followed by a 7-day thermal acclimation at each target temperature. The fish were fed ad libitum during the experiment. The results showed that cumulative mortalities were significantly increased at low temperatures (12 and 13. °C) and at the highest temperature (32. °C). For the survivors, their growth profile closely followed the left-skewed 'thermal performance curve'. Routine oxygen consumption rates of fish larvae were significantly elevated at 32. °C but suppressed at 13 and 15. °C (due to a high mortality, larvae from 12. °C were not examined). Levels of heat shock proteins and activities of malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase were also measured in fish larvae exposed at 15, 25 and 32. °C. The activities of both enzymes were significantly increased at both 15 and 32. °C, where the fish larvae probably suffered from thermal discomfort and increased anaerobic components so as to compensate the mismatch of energy demand and supply at these thermal extremes. Coincidently, heat shock proteins were also up-regulated at both 15 and 32. °C, enabling cellular protection. Moreover, the critical thermal maxima and minima of fish larvae increased significantly with increasing acclimation temperature, implying that the fish could develop some degrees of thermal tolerance through temperature acclimation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Temperature and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are key environmental drivers that are linked in their effects on cellular damage. Exposure to both high temperatures and UVR can cause cellular damage that result in the up-regulation of common protective mechanisms, such as the induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and antioxidants. As such, the interactive effects of these stressors at the cellular level may determine physiological limits, such as thermal tolerance. Furthermore, antioxidant activity is often thermally sensitive, which may lead to temperature dependent effects of UVR exposure. Here we examined the interactive effects of temperature and UVR on upper thermal limits, Hsp70 abundance, oxidative damage and antioxidant (catalase) activity. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to one of three temperature treatments (constant 18. °C, constant 28. °C and daily fluctuations between 18 and 28. °C) in the presence or absence of UVR. Tadpoles were tested for upper thermal limits (CTmax), induction of Hsp70, oxidative damage and catalase activity. Our results show that CTmax was influenced by an interactive effect between temperature and UVR treatment. For tadpoles kept in cold temperatures, exposure to UVR led to cross-tolerance to high temperatures, increasing CTmax. Plasticity in this trait was not fully explained by changes in the lower level mechanistic traits examined. These results highlight the difficulty in predicting the mechanistic basis for the interactive effects of multiple stressors on whole animal traits. Multifactorial studies may therefore be required to understand how complex mechanistic processes shape physiological tolerances, and determine responses to environmental variation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Understanding the capacity of organisms to cope with projected global warming through acclimation and adaptation is critical to predicting their likely future persistence. The vast majority of research on tropical species suggests they will be substantially negatively affected by future warming and have limited capacity to acclimate to changes. This study tested whether the spine cheek anemonefish, Premnas biaculeatus, has the capacity for developmental thermal acclimation of metabolic attributes and critical thermal maximum (CT{\textless}inf{\textgreater}max{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) to increasing sea water temperature. Juveniles of P. biaculeatus exhibited high capacity for developmental thermal acclimation of aerobic physiology. Fish reared at +1.5°C and +3.0°C above present-day mean temperatures possessed enhanced performance across all testing temperatures (28.5°C to 31.5°C), i.e. overcompensation. Specifically, this occurred through increases in maximum oxygen consumption (MO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2Maximum{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) that resulted in elevations in both net and factorial aerobic scope. In addition, fish reared at +1.5°C also exhibited a partial increase in critical thermal maximum (CT{\textless}inf{\textgreater}max{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) by 0.5°C, however no increase was observed in fish reared at +3.0°C. Fish reared at +3.0°C were significantly longer, heavier and in better condition than +0.0°C present-day fish, suggesting that alterations to aerobic physiology correspond to enhancement of growth and condition as would be predicted with the oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance hypothesis. These results indicate that the acclimation to future warming may produce overall enhanced performance in some species. It also suggests that the developmental acclimation ability varies substantially between species within the same family and a greater understanding of promoted or reduced acclimation capacity will be critically important to predicting the impacts of climate change on coral reef systems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The thermal acclimatory capacity of a particular species may determine its resilience to environmental change. Evaluating the physiological acclimatory responses of economically important species is useful for determining their optimal culture conditions. Here, juvenile Chinese three-keeled pond turtles (Mauremys reevesii) were acclimated to one of three different temperatures (17, 25 or 33°C) for four weeks to assess the effects of thermal acclimation on some physiological traits. Thermal acclimation significantly affected thermal resistance, but not thermal preference, of juvenile M. reevesii. Turtles acclimated to 17°C were less resistant to high temperatures than those acclimated to 25°C and 33°C. However, turtles increased resistance to low temperatures with decreasing acclimation temperature. The acclimation response ratio of the critical thermal minimum (CTMin) was lower than that of the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) for acclimation temperatures between 17 and 25°C, but slightly higher between 25 and 33°C. The thermal resistance range (i.e., the difference between CTMax and CTMin) was widest in turtles acclimated to the intermediate temperature (25°C), and narrowest in those acclimated to low temperature (17°C). The standard metabolic rate increased as body temperature and acclimation temperature increased, and the temperature quotient (Q10) between acclimation temperatures 17 and 25°C was higher than the Q10 between 25 and 33°C. Our results suggest that juvenile M. reevesii may have a greater resistance under mild thermal conditions resembling natural environments, and better physiological performance at relatively warm temperatures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Amphibious fishes often emerse (leave water) when faced with unfavourable water conditions. How amphibious fishes cope with the risks of rising water temperatures may depend, in part, on the plasticity of behavioural mechanisms such as emersion thresholds. We hypothesized that the emersion threshold is reversibly plastic and thus dependent on recent acclimation history rather than on conditions during early development. Kryptolebias marmoratus were reared for 1 year at 25 or 30°C and acclimated as adults (one week) to either 25 or 30°C before exposure to an acute increase inwater temperature. The emersion threshold temperature and acute thermal tolerance were significantly increased in adult fish acclimated to 30°C, but rearing temperature had no significant effect. Using a thermal imaging camera, we also showed that emersed fish in a low humidity aerial environment (30°C) lost significantly more heat (3.3°Cmin-1) than those in a high humidity environment (1.6°Cmin-1). In the field, mean relative humidity was 84\%. These results provide evidence of behavioural avoidance of high temperatures and the first quantification of evaporative cooling in an amphibious fish. Furthermore, the avoidance response was reversibly plastic, flexibility that may be important for tropical amphibious fishes under increasing pressures from climatic change. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Tropical ectothermic species are currently depicted as more vulnerable to increasing temperatures because of the proximity between their upper thermal limits and environmental temperatures. Yet, the acclimatory capacity of thermal limits has rarely been measured in tropical species, even though they are generally predicted to be smaller than in temperate species. We compared critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and warming tolerance (WT: the difference between CTmax and maximum temperature, Tmax), as well as CTmax acclimatory capacity of toad species from the Atlantic forest (AF) and the Brazilian Caatinga (CAA), a semi-arid habitat with high temperatures. Acclimation temperatures represented the mean temperatures of AF and CAA habitats, making estimates of CTmax and WT more ecologically realistic. CAA species mean CTmax was higher compared to AF species in both acclimation treatments. Clutches within species, as well as between AF and CAA species, differed in CTmax plasticity and we discuss the potential biological meaning of these findings. We did not find a trade-off between absolute CTmax and CTmax plasticity, indicating that species can have both high CTmax and high CTmax plasticity. Although CTmax was highly correlated to Tmax, CTmax plasticity was not related to Tmax or Tmax coefficients of variation. CAA species mean WT was lower than for AF species, but still very high for all species, diverging from other studies with tropical species. This might be partially related to over-estimation of vulnerability due to under-appreciation of realistic acclimation treatments in CTmax estimation. Thus, some tropical species might not be as vulnerable to warming as previously predicted if CTmax is considered as a shifting population parameter. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Temperature is an important factor affecting the distribution of freshwater fishes. The longfin dace (Agosia chrysogaster) is endemic to the Gila River basin of the southwestern USA and northern Mexico and occupies a range of thermal environments from cool mountain tributaries to warm desert rivers but information about its thermal biology is limited, particularly for larvae. We quantified the effect of rearing temperature on survival, growth capacity, and critical thermal maximum (CTM) of larval longfin dace. Broodstocks of longfin dace were collected from two sites in the upper Gila River in New Mexico from which larvae were hatched and reared for 22 days in indoor aquaria at constant temperatures ranging from 18.0 to 31.0 °C. Growth capacity peaked at 27.0 °C and was 21 \% greater for larvae hatched from the upstream compared to the downstream broodstock, indicating intraspecific variability in growth capacity. CTM increased with rearing temperature and ranged from 33.9 to 39.9 °C, indicating that thermal acclimation influences maximum thermal tolerance. CTM and acclimation response ratio of larvae are lower than those of adult longfin dace measured in a previous study, suggesting that larvae are more sensitive and less responsive to thermal stress than adults. Water temperatures in 2012 from six sites in the upper Gila River basin did not exceed 27.0 °C and larval growth capacities in May of 2012 ranged from 5 to 28 \% of the maximum growth capacity. We assert that rising temperatures may increase larval growth rates, although this will depend on resource limitation and shifts in community interactions. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Effect of rearing temperature on growth and thermal tolerance of Schizothorax (Racoma) kozlovi Nikolsky larvae and juveniles was investigated. The fish (start at 12. d post hatch) were reared for nearly 6 months at five constant temperatures of 10, 14, 18, 22 and 26. °C. Then juvenile fish being acclimated at three temperatures of 14, 18 and 22. °C were chosen to determine their critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and lethal thermal maximum (LTMax) by using the dynamic method. Growth rate of S. kozlovi larvae and juveniles was significantly influenced by temperature and fish size, exhibiting an increase with increased rearing temperature, but a decline with increased fish size. A significant ontogenetic variation in the optimal temperatures for maximum growth were estimated to be 24.7. °C and 20.6. °C for larvae and juveniles of S. kozlovi, respectively. The results also demonstrated that acclimation temperature had marked effects on their CTMax and LTMax, which ranged from 32.86. °C to 34.54. °C and from 33.79. °C to 34.80. °C, respectively. It is suggested that rearing temperature must never rise above 32. °C for its successful aquaculture. Significant temperature effects on the growth rate and thermal tolerance both exhibit a plasticity pattern. Determination of critical heat tolerance and optima temperature for maximum growth of S. kozlovi is of ecological significance in the conservation and aquaculture of this species. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Freshwater mussels (Unionidae) are a highly imperilled faunal group. One critical threat is thermal sensitivity, because global climate change and other anthropogenic activities contribute to increasing stream temperature and altered hydrologic flow that may be detrimental to freshwater mussels. We incorporated four benthic environmental components - temperature, sediment, water level (a surrogate for flow) and a vertical thermal gradient in the sediment column - in laboratory mesocosm experiments with juveniles of two species of freshwater mussels (Lampsilis abrupta and Lampsilis radiata) and tested their effects on survival, burrowing behaviour and byssus production. Increasing temperature diminished burrowing behaviour significantly in both species (P {\textless} 0.01), and the dewatered treatment significantly reduced burrowing in L. radiata, compared with that in the watered treatment. Increasing temperature also significantly reduced byssus production in both species (P {\textless} 0.01). Median lethal temperatures (LT50) ranged from 29.9 to 35.6 °C. Mussels did not burrow beneath the top stratum of sediment (0-2.5 cm) and thus did not use the available thermal refuge. Our findings suggest that rising stream water temperature and dewatering may directly impact freshwater mussel abundance by causing mortality and may have indirect impacts via sublethal effects. Reduced burrowing capacity may hamper ability to escape predation or unfavourably high or low flows, and decreased byssus production may inhibit attachment and dispersal capabilities in juveniles.

	abstract = {Little is known about the capacity of early life stages to undergo hypercapnic and thermal acclimation under the future scenarios of ocean acidification and warming. Here, we investigated a comprehensive set of biological responses to these climate change-related variables (2°C above winter and summer average spawning temperatures and ApH=0.5 units) during the early ontogeny of the squid Loligo vulgaris. Embryo survival rates ranged from 92\% to 96\% under present-day temperature (13-17°C) and pH (8.0) scenarios. Yet, ocean acidification (pH 7.5) and summer warming (19°C) led to a significant drop in the survival rates of summer embryos (47\%, P{\textless}0.05). The embryonic period was shortened by increasing temperature in both pH treatments (P{\textless}0.05). Embryo growth rates increased significantly with temperature under present-day scenarios, but there was a significant trend reversal under future summer warming conditions (P{\textless}0.05). Besides pronounced premature hatching, a higher percentage of abnormalities was found in summer embryos exposed to future warming and lower pH (P{\textless}0.05). Under the hypercapnic scenario, oxygen consumption rates decreased significantly in late embryos and newly hatched paralarvae, especially in the summer period (P{\textless}0.05). Concomitantly, there was a significant enhancement of the heat shock response (HSP70/HSC70) with warming in both pH treatments and developmental stages. Upper thermal tolerance limits were positively influenced by acclimation temperature, and such thresholds were significantly higher in late embryos than in hatchlings under present-day conditions (P{\textless}0.05). In contrast, the upper thermal tolerance limits under hypercapnia were higher in hatchlings than in embryos. Thus, we show that the stressful abiotic conditions inside the embryo's capsules will be exacerbated under near-future ocean acidification and summer warming scenarios. The occurrence of prolonged embryogenesis along with lowered thermal tolerance limits under such conditions is expected to negatively affect the survival success of squid early life stages during the summer spawning period, but not winter spawning. © 2014.

In addition, feeding rate (FR), feeding efficiency (FE) and specific growth rate (SGR) were measured. The diel-fluctuating temperature group showed lower CTmin than the 20°C group but a similar CTmax, indicating a wider thermal scope. SDA linearly increased with the temperature. Temperature variation between 20 and 25°C had little effect on either swimming or growth performance. However, fish in the 15°C group exhibited much poorer swimming and growth performance than those in the 20°C group. Ucrit decreased slightly under low acclimation temperature due to the pronounced improvement in swimming efficiency under cold temperature. Fish in the diel-fluctuating temperature group fed more but exhibited similar SGR compared to 20°C group, possibly due in part to an increase in energy expenditure to cope with the temperature fluctuation. The narrower thermal scope and lower CTmax of Chinese bream together with the conservation of CTmax with temperature acclimation, suggests that local water temperature elevations may have more profound effects on Chinese bream than on other fish species in the Three Gorges Reservoir. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Median lethal temperature (LT50) data from water-only exposures with the early life stages of freshwater mussels suggest that some species may be living near their upper thermal tolerances. However, evaluation of thermal sensitivity has never been conducted in sediment. Mussels live most of their lives burrowed in sediment, so understanding the effect of sediment on thermal sensitivity is a necessary step in evaluating the effectiveness of the water-only standard method, on which the regulatory framework for potential thermal criteria currently is based, as a test of thermal sensitivity. We developed a method for testing thermal sensitivity of juvenile mussels in sediment and used the method to assess thermal tolerance of 4 species across a range of temperatures common during summer. Stream beds may provide a thermal refuge in the wild, but we hypothesized that the presence of sediment alone does not alter thermal sensitivity. We also evaluated the effects of 2 temperature acclimation levels (22 and 27°C) and 2 water levels (watered and dewatered treatments). We then compared results from the sediment tests to those conducted using the water-only standard methods. We also conducted water-only LT tests with mussel larvae (glochidia) for comparison with the juvenile life stage. We found few consistent differences in thermal tolerance between sediment and water-only treatments, between acclimation temperatures, between waterlevel treatments, among species, or between juvenile and glochidial life stages (LT50 range = 33.3-37.2°C; mean = 35.6°C), supporting our hypothesis that the presence of sediment alone does not alter thermal sensitivity. The method we developed has potential for evaluating the role of other stressors (e.g., contaminants) in a more natural and complex environment. © 2014 by The Society for Freshwater Science.},

In the present study, we show that future predictions of ocean warming (+4°C) and acidification (ΔpH=0.5 units) may compromise the development of early life stages of a highly commercial teleost fish, Solea senegalensis. Exposure to future conditions caused a decline in hatching success and larval survival. Growth, metabolic rates and thermal tolerance increased with temperature but decreased under acidified conditions. Hypercapnia and warming amplified the incidence of deformities by 31.5\% (including severe deformities such as lordosis, scoliosis and kyphosis), while promoting the occurrence of oversized otoliths (109.3\% increase). Smaller larvae with greater skeletal deformities and larger otoliths may face major ecophysiological challenges, which might potentiate substantial declines in adult fish populations, putting in jeopardy the species' fitness under a changing ocean. © 2014.

	abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are among the most human-impacted habitats globally, and their management is often critically linked to recovery of declining native species. In the San Francisco Estuary, the Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is an endemic, endangered fish strongly tied to Californian conservation planning. The complex life history of Delta Smelt combined with dynamic seasonal and spatial abiotic conditions result in dissimilar environments experienced among ontogenetic stages, which may yield stage-specific susceptibility to abiotic stressors. Climate change is forecasted to increase San Francisco Estuary water temperature and salinity; therefore, understanding the influences of ontogeny and phenotypic plasticity on tolerance to these critical environmental parameters is particularly important for Delta Smelt and other San Francisco Estuary fishes. We assessed thermal and salinity limits in several ontogenetic stages and acclimation states of Delta Smelt, and paired these data with environmental data to evaluate sensitivity to climate-change stressors. Thermal tolerance decreased among successive stages, with larval fish exhibiting the highest tolerance and post-spawning adults having the lowest. Delta Smelt had limited capacity to increase tolerance through thermal acclimation, and comparisons with field temperature data revealed that juvenile tolerance limits are the closest to current environmental conditions, which may make this stage especially susceptible to future climate warming. Maximal water temperatures observed in situ exceeded tolerance limits of juveniles and adults. Although these temperature events are currently rare, if they increase in frequency as predicted, it could result in habitat loss at these locations despite other favourable conditions for Delta Smelt. In contrast, Delta Smelt tolerated salinities spanning the range of expected environmental conditions for each ontogenetic stage, but salinity did impact survival in juvenile and adult stages in exposures over acute time scales. Our results underscore the importance of considering ontogeny and phenotypic plasticity in assessing the impacts of climate change, particularly for species adapted to spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments. © The Author 2014.},

	abstract = {The significant influence of thermal acclimation on physiological and behavioral performance has been documented in many ectothermic animals, but such studies are still limited in turtle species. We acclimated hatchling soft-shelled turtles Pelodiscus sinensis under three thermal conditions (10, 20 and 30 °C) for 4 weeks, and then measured selected body temperature (Tsel), critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax), and locomotor performance at different body temperatures. Thermal acclimation significantly affected thermal preference and resistance of P. sinensis hatchlings. Hatchling turtles acclimated to 10 °C selected relatively lower body temperatures and were less resistant to high temperatures than those acclimated to 20 °C and 30 °C. The turtles' resistance to low temperatures increased with a decreasing acclimation temperature. The thermal resistance range (i.e. the difference between CTMax and CTMin, TRR) was widest in turtles acclimated to 20 °C, and narrowest in those acclimated to 10 °C. The locomotor performance of turtles was affected by both body temperature and acclimation temperature. Hatchling turtles acclimated to relatively higher temperatures swam faster than did those acclimated to lower temperatures. Accordingly, hatchling turtles acclimated to a particular temperature may not enhance the performance at that temperature. Instead, hatchlings acclimated to relatively warm temperatures have a better performance, supporting the "hotter is better" hypothesis. © 2013 Current Zoology.},

	abstract = {A 30-day acclimation trial was conducted using Tor putitora to elucidate its thermal tolerance, oxygen consumption, haemato-biochemical variables and selected enzymatic activities at five acclimation temperatures (AT). Juveniles of T. putitora were randomly distributed among five treatment groups (20, 23, 26, 29 and 32 ± 0.5 °C). There was a significant curvilinear increase in critical thermal maxima (CTmax) (y = -0.0693x 2 + 1.7927x + 34.628, R2 = 0.996) and lethal thermal maxima (LTmax) (y = -0.1493x 2 + 2.3407x + 35.092, R2 = 0.991) with increasing AT. The oxygen consumption rate increased significantly with increasing AT. The Q10 values were 1.16 between 20 and 23 °C, 3.09 between 23 and 26 °C, 1.31 between 26 and 29 °C and 1.76 between 29 and 32 °C of AT. The acclimation response ratios were ranged between 0.37 and 0.59. Catalase, superoxide dismutase and ATPase activities were increased linearly in liver, gill and kidney, while brain acetylcholine esterase activity decreased linearly with increasing AT. Blood glucose remained unchanged up to AT of 26 °C and increased significantly at AT of 29 and 32 °C. Haemoglobin content was increased linearly with increasing AT. The highest WBC count was observed at 20 °C, and no significant changes found till AT of 26 °C and significantly decreased at 32 °C. Total serum protein and globulin were significantly decreased with increasing AT. Highest values were observed at 20 °C and remained consistent till 26 °C, then decreased significantly. There was no significant change in A/G ratio through the AT 20-29 °C and increased significantly at 32 °C. The increase in CTmax, LTmax and oxygen consumption rate with increasing AT may suggest that the thermal tolerance of T. putitora is dependent on its prior thermal exposure history, and it could adapt to higher AT by altering its haemato-biochemical variables. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {It has now been well established that insects can respond to variation in their environment via acclimation, yet the extent of the response varies among populations and environmental characteristics. One under-investigated theme which may contribute to this variation concerns acclimation effects across the life cycle. The present study explores how acclimation in the larval stage of Culex pipiens affects thermal relations in the adult stage. Mosquitoes were reared in a full factorial design at 18 or 26°C as larvae and adults, then critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and metabolic rate-temperature relationships (MR-T) were determined for all 4 treatments. CTmax was positively affected by both larval and adult acclimation treatments. MR-T slope was significantly affected only by adult treatment: warm acclimated adults had on average shallower slopes and higher y-intercepts than cool acclimated ones. These results demonstrate that larval acclimation effects can alter adult phenotypes in a species whose life cycle includes two drastically different environments, an aquatic and a terrestrial stage. Studying insects with complex life cycles, especially those with aquatic or subterranean larval stages, can provide valuable information on the effects of thermal variability and predictability on phenotypic plasticity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) significantly differed among populations and temperature treatments. Populations with shorter migration distance and a lower migration and spawning temperature tended to have higher CTmax at 90 days posthatch. However, the relationship was reversed when fish of similar size were compared at 135-214 days posthatch. CTmax at 90 days posthatch was also positively related to body mass, which differed appreciably among populations at this development stage. With growth, the population differences in CTmax diminished from 3.1 to 1 °C. Elevated incubation temperature also decreased CTmax. Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT) for maximum heart rate differed among populations incubated at 14 °C. The Chilko Lake population, which rear at 1.2 km above sea level, had the highest heart rate across all temperatures when incubated at 14 °C, but the lowest ABT among populations.

The fish tested included 2 stocks of Bonneville cutthroat trout (O. c. utah), a lacustrine stock derived from Bear Lake and a fluvial-origin stock from southern Utah (Manning Meadow Reservoir). The other 2 stocks tested were from Electric Lake (largely Yellowstone cutthroat trout, O. c. bouvieri) and Jackson Hole, Wyoming (fine-spotted Snake River cutthroat trout, O. c. subsp.). Temperature tests were either critical thermal maximum (CTM) or 96-hour trials using juveniles acclimated between 12.5°C and 18.0°C. Two CTM end points were temperature at first loss of equilibrium (CTMeq) and onset of spasms (CTMs). There were no significant differences in CTMeq among test fish acclimated to 18.0°C, but CTMs was significantly higher for Bear Lake Bonneville (30.0°C) than for Snake River (29.6°C) or southern Bonneville (29.7°C) stocks. With fish acclimated at 13.0°C, there were no significant differences among the stocks in CTMeq or CTMs. Differences among stocks varied significantly among nine 96-hour tests. Overall, it appeared that the southern Bonneville stock had slightly better survival at warmer temperatures than other stocks. In 24-hour survival tests at high salinities, the Snake River stock had the lowest tolerance, with significant mortality occuring at 18‰ (29.5 mS·cm-1 conductivity). The southern Bonneville stock had the highest tolerance, with no mortality until 22‰ (38 mS·cm-1). Bear Lake Bonneville and Electric Lake stocks had 60\% and 30\% mortality, respectively, at 21‰ (36 mS·cm-1).

	abstract = {The robust redhorse, Moxostoma robustum (Teleostei: Catostomidae), is an imperiled sucker native to large rivers of the Atlantic slope of the southeastern United States. Juvenile M. robustum were tested for tolerances to temperature, salinity, pH, and hypoxia in order to evaluate basic early life-history requirements. Static (acute) tests resulted in estimates of mean lower temperature tolerances (5.3-19.4 °C) that varied with prior thermal acclimation and indicated no apparent difference in tolerance among fish 30, 60, and 90 days old. Fish acclimated to 20 °C and 30 °C had significantly different mean critical thermal maxima (34.9 °C and 37.2 °C, respectively) and exhibited pronounced increased opercular ventilation rates with elevated temperatures. Fish exposed to acute and chronic increases in salinity showed unusual patterns of mortality above the isosmotic point (9 ppt) that reflected possible differences in body mass and prior acclimation conditions (i.e., water ionic composition); small fish and those held in soft water were the least tolerant of increased salinity. Abrupt exposure to extreme pH values resulted in greater than 50\% mortality at pH values below 4.3 and above 9.5 within a 96-hour period. Fish exposed to progressive hypoxia utilized aquatic surface respiration at a mean oxygen concentration of 0.72-0.80 mg O2 l-1 (20 °C and 30 °C acclimated fish, respectively), and lost equilibrium at 0.54-.57 mg O2 l-1. Juvenile M. robustum are moderately tolerant of a wide range of ambient physicochemical parameters, but further research is needed to determine how both abiotic and biotic factors have contributed to population decline and extirpation of this species.},

	abstract = {Juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; initially 2-5 g) were exposed for 90 days to either ambient water temperature (natural thermal regime) or to +2°C superimposed above the ambient water temperature (simulated global warming scenario), in the presence or absence of a nominal 70 μM total ammonia (1290 μg l-1 ionized NH4+), 10 μg l-1 un-ionized (NH3) ammonia). The exposures were conducted in moderately hard de-chlorinated water from Lake Ontario ([Ca2+] = 0.96 ± 0.02 mM, [Na+] = 0.55 ± 0.01 mM, [Cl-] = 0.737 ± 0.004 mM) on three occasions: over summer (temperature range, 13.0-21.0°C; pH = 7.57 ± 0.26) and winter (temperature range, 3.5-7.0°C; pH = 7.46 ± 0.02) without food limitation (satiation feeding), and during summer (temperature range, 13.0-18.5°C; pH = 7.38 ± 0.09) with food limitation (1\% daily, or restricted ration). Lethal temperature, lethal ammonia (1.8 mM total ammonia; approximately 31,700 μg l-1 NH4+, 900 μg l-1 NH3), and lethal temperature plus ammonia challenges were conducted after each 90-day exposure to determine whether or not chronic pre-exposure conferred any increased tolerance to elevated temperature or ammonia. In addition, acute sublethal ammonia challenges (1.0 mM total ammonia; approximately 17,800 μg l-1 NH4+, 200 μg l-1 NH3), together with unidirectional Na+ flux measurements, were conducted after the two summer exposures to gain further insight into the effects of prior sublethal ammonia exposure on Na+ regulation, as influenced by ration. The juvenile trout on unlimited ration and exposed to a warming scenario of +2°C exhibited a slight, but significant elevation in lethal temperatures in both summer and winter, but the effect was not observed in fish fed a restricted ration. A challenge to lethal temperature and ammonia in combination reduced the lethal temperature anywhere from 3-7°C for fish from all treatments; pre-exposure to ammonia offered some protective effect. However, prior ammonia exposure did not prolong survival times (LT50s) during lethal ammonia challenge, and there was no evidence of acclimation to elevated external ammonia with respect to Na+ balance. These results suggest that juvenile trout are likely to adapt to a small temperature increase, such as could be associated with a global warming scenario, but their potential for doing so may be restricted by sublethal ammonia and by nutritional status.},

	abstract = {The chief objective was to determine the critical thermal limits for alevins, fry and parr of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, (L.) from four races living in Windermere (northwest England). The experimental fish were reared in a hatchery but were the progeny of wild parents. As comparisons between tethal temperatures at four acclimation temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20° C) revealed few significant racial differences, the data were pooled to estimate the lethal values for survival over 7 days (incipient lethal temperature) and over only 10 min (ultimate lethal temperature) for each life stage. Upper lethal values increased with acclimation temperatures for alevins but this effect was negligible for fry and parr, Alevins were generally less tolerant than fry and parr at lower, but not higher, acclimation temperatures; e.g. after acclimation at 5° C, mean upper ultimate values were 23·3, 25·1 and 25·7° C and mean upper incipient values were 18·7, 21·5 and 21·5° C for alevins, fry and parr respectively; after acclimation at 20° C, mean upper ultimate and incipient values were 26·2, 26·1 and 26·6° C and 20·8, 20·8 and 21·6° C for alevins, fry and parr respectively. The area of the temperature tolerance polygon (expressed as ° C2) for juvenile Arctic charr is amongst the lowest recorded for salmonids; being 409, 439 and 461° C2 for alevins, fry and parr respectively. These low values are due to lower upper tolerance limits, not high lower tolerance limits; the latter being close to 0° C (\&lt;1°C for parr and fry, \&lt;0·3° C for alevins) at all acclimation temperatures. Arctic charr are therefore amongst the least resistant of salmonids to high temperatures but probably the most resistant to low temperatures. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

This information on red drum thermal tolerance limits was used to determine whether a more northerly distributed population exhibits greater cold tolerance and could therefore be used to improve success of stocking programs. A 96-h temperature tolerance test was performed on juveniles (71-155 mm total length) acclimated to water temperatures ranging from 12.0 to 28.0°C at a salinity of 20\%o.

The upper LT50 for Texas red drums acclimated to 28.0°C was within 1.1°C of that calculated for South Carolina red drums acclimated to the same temperature (upper LT50s were 35.7 and 34.6°C). Upper LT50s for fish acclimated to 20.0 and 12.0°C were also similar between the two stocks. Likewise, lower LT50s were similar between the two stocks of red drums: as determined from fish acclimated to 14.0 and 28.0°C, ranges of lower LTSOs were 2.8-9.0°C for the Texas stock and 2.6-9.3°C for the South Carolina stock. The lower LT50 could not be determined for red drums acclimated to 12.0°C, because only three fish died. No consistent differences in temperature tolerance limits were found between the two hatchery stocks, precluding any recommendation to stock one group instead of the other. © by the American Fisheries Society 1993.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY. 1. The chief objective was to construct a thermal tolerance polygon for juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., using fish from four groups and two populations: two age groups from one population (0+, 1+ parr from River Leven), two size groups from the other population (slow and Fast growing 1+ parr from River Lune). 2. Fish were acclimated to constant temperatures of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 27°C; then the temperature was raised or lowered at 1°C h−1 to determine the upper and lower limits for feeding and survival over 10 min, 100 min, 1000 min and 7 days. As they were not significantly different between the four groups of fish, values at each acclimation temperature were pooled to provide arithmetic means (with SE) for the thermal tolerance polygon. 3. Incipient lethal levels (survival over 7 days) defined a tolerance zone within which salmon lived for a considerable time; upper mean incipient values increased with increasing acclimation temperature to reach a maximum of 27.8±0.2°C, lower mean incipient values were below 0°C and were therefore undetermined at acclimation temperatures \&lt;20°C but increased at higher acclimation temperatures to 2.2±0.4°C. Resistance to thermal stress outside the tolerance zone was a function of time; the ultimate lethal level (survival for 10 min) increased with acclimation temperature to a maximum of 33°C whilst the minimum value remained close to 0°C. Temperature limits for feeding increased slightly with acclimation temperature to upper and lower mean values of 22.5±0.3°C and 7.0±0.3°C. 4. In spite of different methodologies, values in the present investigation are similar to those obtained in previous, less comprehensive studies in the laboratory. They also agree with field observations on the temperature limits for feeding and survival. Thermal tolerance polygons are now available for eight species of salmonids and show that the highest temperature limits for feeding and survival are those recorded for juvenile Atlantic salmon.

Thermal responses for each stock were measured as the critical thermal maximum, the temperature at which death occurred during a temperature increase of 0.2°C/min, for fish at various acclimation temperatures (8, 16, 24, 32°C); and chronic thermal maximum, the temperature at which death occurred during a temperature increase of l°C/d, for fish acclimated to 32°C. The rank order of values for both response measurements was identical for the four stocks: F × N {\textgreater} FLMB {\textgreater} N × F {\textgreater} NLMB. Increased acclimation temperature resulted in significant, proportional increases in the critical thermal maxima for all stocks. In addition, second-generation hybrid stocks (N × F F2 and F × N F2) that were acclimated at 24°C produced similar critical thermal maximum values (38.4°C and 37.8°C, respectively) that were intermediate between those of the NLMB (37.3°C) and FLMB (39.2°C). Subsequent genetic analysis revealed no correlation between critical thermal maximum and genotype at the three enzyme loci studied (Mdh-B, Idh-B, and Aat-B). Thus, the subspecific origin of the alleles at these three loci had no detectable influence on the thermal responses of hybrid offspring. © By the American Fisheries Society 1987.},

Temperature increase rates were 1, 6, 18, 30 and 60° C h-1. Analysis of variance showed significant (P \&lt; 0.5) differences due to acclimation level, temperature increase rate, and an interaction between these variables. CTM values for coho, a stenothermal fish, were lower than those for pumpkinseed, an eurythermal fish. Generally, higher acclimations and more rapid rates of temperature increase produced higher CTM values. Upward acclimation during testing was detected only for 10° C acclimated pumpkinseed at a 1° C h-1 increase rate Assessments were made of CTM procedural relationships from test data and the literature. A 1° C min-1 (60° C h-1) temperature increase rate is so rapid that internal body temperatures of fish will usually lag behind media temperatures. A standard increase rate of 18° C h-1 (0.3° C min-1 is recommended for routine CTM determinations with fish. Other recommendations are: 1) Test fish should be small, and relatively uniform in size and condition; 2) final loss of ability to return upright should be the loss of equilibrium criterion; 3) death also should be included as a criterion in CTM determinations, with the term 'lethal thermal maximum' applied for death temperature; and 4) linearity should be maintained in time-temperature distributions of the heating rate. All procedures are also applicable to determinations of the critical thermal minimum. An amended description of the CTM is given that expands its scope. © 1979 Dr. W. Junk b.v. Publishers.},

	abstract = {Dropping off is considered an anti-predator behavior for aphids since previous studies have shown that it reduces the risk of predation. However, little attention is paid to dropping behavior triggered by other external stresses such as daytime high temperatures which are predicted to become more frequent in the context of climate warming. Here we defined a new parameter, drop-off temperature (DOT), to describe the critical temperature at which an aphid drops off its host plant when the ambient temperature increases gradually and slowly. Detailed studies were conducted to reveal effects of short-term acclimation (temperature, exposure time at high-temperature and starvation) on DOT of an aphid species, Sitobion avenae. Our objectives were to test if the aphids dropped off host plant to avoid high temperatures and how short-term acclimation affected the aphids' dropping behavior in response to heat stress. We suggest that dropping is a behavioral thermoregulation to avoid heat stress, since aphids started to move before they dropped off and the dropped aphids were still able to control their muscles prior to knockdown. The adults starved for 12 h had higher DOT values than those that were unstarved or starved for 6 h, and there was a trade-off between behavioral thermoregulation and energy acquisition. Higher temperatures and longer exposure times at high temperatures significantly lowered the aphids' DOT, suggested that the aphids avoid heat stress by dropping when exposed to high temperatures. Climate warming may therefore increase the aphids' dropping probabilities and consequently affect the aphids' individual development and population growth. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The mean ±s.d.T cmax for O. c. pleuriticus acclimated to 10° C was 24·6 ± 2·0°C (n = 30), for 15° C-acclimated fish was 26·9 ± 1·5° C (n = 23) and for 20° C-acclimated fish was 29·4 ± 1·1° C (n = 28); these results showed a marked thermal acclimation effect (Q 10 = 1·20). Interestingly, there was a size effect within treatments, wherein the T cmax of larger fish was significantly lower than that of smaller fish acclimated to the same temperature. The critical thermal tolerances of age 0 year O. c. pleuriticus were also evaluated from three separate populations: Lake Nanita, Trapper Creek and Carr Creek reared under 'common-garden' conditions prior to thermal acclimation. The Trapper Creek population had significantly warmer T cmax than the Lake Nanita population, but that of the Carr Creek fish had T cmax similar to both Trapper Creek and Lake Nanita fish. A comparison of these O. c. pleuriticus T cmax results with those of other stream-dwelling salmonids suggested that O. c. pleuriticus are less resistant to rapid thermal fluctuations when acclimated to cold temperatures, but can tolerate similar temperatures when acclimated to warmer temperatures. © 2012 The Authors.

	abstract = {1 Aphids, similar to all insects, are ectothermic and, consequently, are greatly affected by environmental conditions. The peach potato aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) has a global distribution, although it is not known whether populations display regional adaptations to distinct climatic zones along its distribution and vary in their ability to withstand and acclimate to temperature extremes. In the present study, lethal temperatures were measured in nine anholocyclic clones of M. persicae collected along a latitudinal cline of its European distribution from Sweden to Spain. The effects of collection origin and intra- and intergenerational acclimation on cold and heat tolerance, as determined by upper and lower lethal temperatures (ULT 50 and LLT 50, respectively), were investigated. 2 Lethal temperatures of M. persicae were shown to be plastic and could be altered after acclimation over just one generation. Lower lethal temperatures were significantly depressed in eight of nine clones after acclimation for one generation at 10°C (range: -13.3 to -16.2°C) and raised after acclimation at 25°C (range: -10.7 to -11.6°C) compared with constant 20°C (range: -11.9 to -12.9°C). Upper lethal temperatures were less plastic, although significantly increased after one generation at 25°C (range: 41.8-42.4°C) and in five of nine clones after acclimation at 10°C. There was no evidence of intergenerational acclimation over three generations. 3 Thermal tolerance ranges were expanded after acclimation at 10 and 25°C compared with constant 20°C, resulting in aphids reared at 10°C surviving over a temperature range that was approximately 2-6°C greater than those reared at 25°C. 4 There was no clear relationship between lethal temperatures and latitude. Large scale mixing of clones may occur across Europe, thus limiting local adaption in thermal tolerance. Clonal type, as identified by microsatellite analysis, did show a relationship with thermal tolerance, notably with Type O clones being the most thermal tolerant. Clonal types may respond independently to climate change, affecting the relative proportions of clones within populations, with consequent implications for biodiversity and agriculture. © 2011 The Authors.

Acclimation temperature significantly affected the CTMin and CTMax values of the fish. At 0.3°Cmin -1 cooling or heating rate, CTMin ranged from 4.10 to 6.77°C and CTMax ranged from 33.23 to 35.95°C in three acclimation temperatures from 15 to 25°C. Thermal tolerance polygon for the juveniles at the tested acclimation temperatures was calculated to be 296.14°C 2. In general, the current data show that our sea bass population possesses acclimation response ratio (ARR) values (0.25-0.27) similar to some tropical species. The cold tolerance values attained for this species ranged from 4.10 to 6.77°C, suggesting that cold winter temperatures may not pose danger during the culture of European sea bass in deep ponds or high water exchange rate systems. Upper thermal tolerance is more of a problem in the southern part of the Mediterranean as maximum water temperature in ponds may sometimes exceed 33-34°C, during which underground cool-water should be used to lower ambient water temperature in the mid-summer. For successful culture of sea bass in ponds, temperature should be maintained around 25°C throughout the year and this can be managed under greenhousing systems using underground well-waters, commonly available in the region. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Rising water temperatures, caused by global climate change, industrial discharges, drought, or land development, could further challenge imperiled unionid communities. The aim of our study was to determine the upper thermal tolerances of the larval (glochidia) and juvenile life stages of freshwater mussels. Glochidia of 8 species of mussels were tested: Lampsilis siliquoidea, Potamilus alatus, Ligumia recta, Ellipsaria lineolata, Lasmigona complanata, Megalonaias nervosa, Alasmidonta varicosa, and Villosa delumbis. Seven of these species also were tested as juveniles. Survival trends were monitored while mussels held at 3 acclimation temperatures (17, 22, and 27°C) were exposed to a range of common and extreme water temperatures (2042°C) in standard acute laboratory tests. The average median lethal temperature (LT50) among species in 24-h tests with glochidia was 31.6°C and ranged from 21.4 to 42.7°C. The mean LT50 in 96-h juvenile tests was 34.7°C and ranged from 32.5 to 38.8°C. Based on comparisons of LT50s, thermal tolerances differed among species for glochidia, but not for juveniles. Acclimation temperature did not affect thermal tolerance for either life stage. Our results indicate that freshwater mussels already might be living close to their upper thermal tolerances in some systems and, thus, might be at risk from rising environmental temperatures. © 2010 The North American Benthological Society.},

Both acclimation temperature and size of the shrimp affected CTMin values of L. vannamei (P\&lt;0.01). Overall, juveniles displayed significantly lower CTMin values than the post-larvae (P\&lt;0.0001). However, the CTMax response by post-larvae and juveniles were not significantly different from each other and no interaction was determined between the acclimation temperature and development stage (P\&gt;0.01). The area of the thermal tolerance polygon over four acclimation temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30°C) for the post-larvae of L. vannamei was calculated to be 434.94°C2. The acclimation response ratio (ARR) values were high ranging from 0.35 to 0.44 for both post-larvae and juveniles. L. vannamei appears to be more sensitive to low temperatures than other penaeid species and its cold tolerance zone ranged from 7.5 to 11°C. In successful aquaculture temperature must never fall below 12°C to prevent mortalities.

	abstract = {Freshwater mussels fulfill an essential role in aquatic communities, but are also one of the most sensitive and rapidly declining faunal groups in North America. Rising water temperatures, caused by global climate change or industrial discharges, can further challenge impaired unionid communities, but thermal stress is almost certainly not the only stressor affecting freshwater mussels. Metals, such as copper (Cu), are a common source of toxicant exposure in aquatic environments. The toxic effects of Cu on the early life stages of freshwater mussels have been well studied, and freshwater mussels are more sensitive to Cu than most aquatic organisms. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of a sublethal copper concentration on the upper thermal tolerance of three species, Lampsilis siliquoidea, Potamilus alatus, and Ligumia recta, of juvenile freshwater mussels in 48- and 96-h tests. Thermal tolerance was determined over a range of experimental temperatures (20-42°C) at three acclimation temperatures (17, 22, and 27°C). Median lethal temperatures (LT50s) were calculated in the absence and presence of Cu, and at 48 h ranged from 34.6 to 44.4°C (mean 37.7°C) without Cu, and from 33.8 to 38.9°C (mean 35.8°C) with Cu. The LT50s at 96 h ranged from 32.5 to 35.6°C (mean 34.5°C) without Cu and from 33.0 to 35.4°C (mean 34.2°C) with Cu. Potamilus alatus had a significantly lower 48 h LT50 with Cu than without Cu at the 22°C acclimation temperature; there were no other significant differences in LT50s attributed to Cu. Survival trends showed limited evidence of interactive effects between copper and temperature for all three species, suggesting the combined stress of elevated temperatures and copper exposure to freshwater mussels should be further explored. © 2009 SETAC.},

In heat shock experiments, sea cucumbers acclimated at different temperatures (22 °C or 12 °C) were exposed to several high temperatures (25, 27, 29, 31 and 32 °C) for 2 h, followed by 2 h recovery at 17 °C, and the levels of hsp70 were measured using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. The maximum induction temperatures for sea cucumbers in 22 °C and 12 °C acclimation treatments were 31 °C and 29 °C, respectively. These results showed that the temperature acclimation could affect sea cucumbers' upper thermal limit, which was related to the changed expression pattern of Hsp70 in the sea cucumber. In practice, sea cucumbers that overwinter in southern China could acquire higher thermal resistance than those reared in the north. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We examined optimal temperatures for growth and the upper thermal tolerance of juvenile northern leatherside chub (Lepidomeda copei). We conducted 2 experiments using the acclimated chronic-exposure method to estimate optimal temperature for growth of age-0 northern leatherside chub (range 12.8-28.3°C). Upper thermal tolerance was estimated using the critical thermal maximum (CTM) and upper incipient lethal temperature (UILT) methods for fish acclimated at 15, 18, 23, and 28°C. We also measured stream temperatures in Yellow Creek, Summit County, Utah, during July-August 2006 to compare our results to actual summer stream temperatures. Survival in growth tests was not significantly different between treatment temperatures in either experiment (P \&gt; 0.098). The optimal temperature for growth in the 1st trial estimated from the 2nd-order polynomial regression was 23.0°C, falling outside the range of experimental temperatures (12.8-22.2°C). The estimated optimal temperature for growth in the 2nd trial was 23.2°C. In the upper thermal tolerance tests, juvenile northern leatherside chub had CTM values between 29.6 and 35.0°C; CTM values increased as acclimation temperature increased. Upper incipient lethal temperatures (LT50) ranged from 26.5 to 30.2°C, increasing with acclimation temperature. Summer stream temperatures in Yellow Creek had a lower mean (14.0-18.1°C) than did the optimal temperature for growth determined in these studies, but these temperatures exhibited diel fluctuations as large as 15.7°C.},

	abstract = {Many populations of shortnose sturgeon, Acipenser brevirostrum, in the southeastern United States continue to suffer from poor juvenile recruitment. High summer water temperatures, which may be exacerbated by anthropogenic activities, are thought to affect recruitment by limiting available summer habitat. However, information regarding temperature thresholds of shortnose sturgeon is limited. In this study, the thermal maximum method and a heating rate of 0.1°C min-1 was used to determine critical and lethal thermal maxima for young-of-the-year (YOY) shortnose sturgeon acclimated to temperatures of 19.5 and 24.1°C. Fish used in the experiment were 0.6 to 35.0 g in weight and 64 to 140 days post hatch (dph) in age. Critical thermal maxima were 33.7°C (±0.3) and 35.1°C (±0.2) for fish acclimated to 19.5 and 24.1°C, respectively. Critical thermal maxima significantly increased with an increase in acclimation temperature (p\&lt;0.0001). Lethal thermal maxima were 34.8°C (±0.1) and 36.1°C (±0.1) for fish acclimated to 19.5 and 24.1°C, respectively. Lethal thermal maxima were significantly affected by acclimation temperature, the log10 (fish weight), and the interaction between log10(fish weight) and acclimation temperature (p\&lt;0.0001). Thermal maxima were used to estimate upper limits of safe temperature, thermal preferences, and optimal growth temperatures of YOY shortnose sturgeon. Upper limits of safe temperature were similar to previous temperature tolerance information and indicate that summer temperatures in southeastern rivers may be lethal to YOY shortnose sturgeon if suitable thermal refuge cannot be found. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The energetic cost of developing in the five regimes was assessed by measuring body size over time. While acclimation accounted for most of the variability in thermal tolerance, there were also significant differences among fish reared in the different regimes, regardless of acclimation. Fish reared in more variable environments (as much as ±6°C diel cycle) had a greater tolerance than those from non-variable environments at the same mean temperature. Fish from the more variable environments were also significantly smaller than those from non-variable environments. These results indicate that the thermal history of individual zebrafish induces irreversible changes to the thermal tolerance of adults. © 2006 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Recent reviews of the adaptive hypotheses for animal responses to acclimation have highlighted the importance of distinguishing between developmental and adult (non-developmental) phenotypic plasticity. There has been little work, however, on separating the effects of developmental plasticity from adult acclimation on physiological traits. Therefore, we investigated the relative contributions of these two distinct forms of plasticity to the environmental physiology of adult tsetse flies by exposing developing pupae or adult flies to different temperatures and comparing their responses. We also exposed flies to different temperatures during development and reexposed them as adults to the same temperatures, to investigate possible cumulative effects. Critical thermal maxima were relatively inflexible in response to acclimation temperatures (21, 25, 29°C) with plasticity type accounting for the majority of the variation (49-67\%, nested ANOVA). By contrast, acclimation had a larger effect on critical thermal minima with treatment temperature accounting for most of the variance (84-92\%). Surprisingly little of the variance in desiccation rate could be explained by plasticity type (30-47\%). The only significant effect of acclimation temperature on standard (resting) metabolic rate of adult flies was at 21°C, resulting in treatment temperature, rather than plasticity type, accounting for the majority of the variance (30-76\%). This study demonstrates that the stage at which acclimation takes place has significant, though often different, effects on several adult physiological traits in G. pallidipes, and therefore that it is not only important to consider the form of plasticity but also the direction of the response and its significance from a life-history perspective.},

	abstract = {Although steelhead (anadromous rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) have the widest natural distribution among Pacific Coast salmonids, their populations have declined because of habitat loss, habitat alteration, and overexploitation. Because juvenile steelhead can be exposed to high summer water temperatures in streams and in California hatcheries that rely on surface water sources, we compared the food consumption, growth, and temperature tolerance of Nimbus-strain steelhead (an introgressed breeding stock in the American River) held at 11, 15, and 19°C in replicated laboratory experiments. Although food consumption rate showed no statistically distinguishable difference among temperatures, the growth rate was higher at 19°C than at 11°C or 15°C, providing evidence that food conversion efficiency in juvenile steelhead is higher at the warmer temperature. Age-0 steelhead showed a clear thermal acclimation effect, as their critical thermal maximum increased from 27.5°C for 11°C-acclimated fish to 29.6°C for fish acclimated to 19°C. We conclude that fish culturists could use the higher growth rate and food conversion efficiency at 19°C to increase the size of their age-0 steelhead. We also suggest that it may be possible to confer greater thermal tolerance on age-0 steelhead by rearing them at elevated temperatures for a short while, but we caution that it would still be necessary to ultimately rear the fish in cooler water to ensure successful smoltification. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2005.},

Four hundred and sixteen L. rohita fry (10 days old, 0.385±0.003 g) were equally distributed between four treatments (26, 31, 33 and 36°C) each with four replicates for 30 days. Highest body weight gain and lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) was recorded between 31 and 33°C.

Thermal tolerance and oxygen consumption studies were carried out after completion of growth study to determine tolerance level and metabolic activity at four different acclimation temperatures. Oxygen consumption rate increased significantly with increasing acclimation temperature. Preferred temperature decided from relationship between acclimation temperature and Q10 values were between 33 and 36°C, which gives a better understanding of optimum temperature for growth of L. rohita. Critical thermal maxima (CTMax) and critical thermal minima (CTMin) were 42.33±0.07, 44.81±0.07, 45.35±0.06, 45.60±0.03 and 12.00±0.08, 12.46±0.04, 13.80±0.10, 14.43±0.06, respectively, and increased significantly with increasing acclimation temperatures (26, 31, 33 and 36°C). Survival (\%) was similar in all groups indicating that temperature range of 26-36°C is not fatal to L. rohita fry.

	abstract = {To make robust projectios of the impacts of climate change, it is critical to understand how abiotic factors may interact to constrain the distribution and productivity of marine flora and fauna. We evaluated the effects of projected end of the century ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) on the thermal tolerance of an important living marine resource, the sea urchin Loxechinus albus, a benthic shallow water coastal herbivore inhabiting part of the Pacific coast of South America. After exposing young juveniles for a 1-month period to contrasting pCO(2) (similar to 500 and 1400 mu atm) and temperature (similar to 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C) levels, critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) as well as thermal tolerance polygons were assessed based on self-righting success as an end point. Transcription of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), a chaperone protecting cellular proteins from environmental stress, was also measured. Exposure to elevated pCO(2) significantly reduced thermal tolerance by increasing CTmin at both experimental temperatures and decreasing amax at 20 degrees C. There was also a strong synergistic effect of OA x OW on HSP70 transcription levels which were 75 times higher than in control conditions. If this species is unable to adapt to elevated pCO(2) in the future, the reduction in thermal tolerance and LISP response suggests that near-future warming and OA will disrupt their performance and reduce their distribution with ecological and economic consequences. Given the wider latitudinal range (6 to 56 degrees S) and environmental tolerance of L. albus compared to other members of this region's benthic invertebrate community, OW and OA may cause substantial changes to the coastal fauna along this geographical range.

	abstract = {The impact of climate change may be felt most keenly by tropical ectotherms. In these taxa, it is argued, thermal specialization means a given shift in temperature will have a larger effect on fitness. For species with limited dispersal ability, the impact of climate change depends on the capacity for their climate-relevant traits to shift. Such shifts can occur through genetic adaptation, various forms of plasticity, or a combination of these processes. Here we assess the extent and causes of shifts in 7 physiological traits in a tropical lizard, the rainforest sunskink (Lampropholis coggeri). Two populations were sampled that differ from each other in both climate and physiological traits. We compared trait values in each animal soon after field collection versus following acclimation to laboratory conditions. We also compared trait values between populations in: (i) recently field-collected animals; (ii) the same animals following laboratory acclimation; and (iii) the laboratory-reared offspring of these animals. Our results reveal high trait lability, driven primarily by acclimation and local adaptation. By contrast, developmental plasticity, resulting from incubation temperature, had little to no effect on most traits. These results suggest that, while specialized, tropical ectotherms may be capable of rapid shifts in climate-relevant traits.},

	abstract = {The influence of acclimation on the cold and heat tolerance of Nilaparvata lugens was determined by measurements of the critical thermal minimum and maximum (CTmin and CTmax), chill and heat coma temperature (CCT and HCT) and lower and upper lethal temperature (LLT50 and ULT50). First-instar nymphs were acclimated for 5 days at 15 degrees C and for 2 days at 30 degrees C and compared with a population maintained at 23 degrees C; for the adult comparisons, first-instar nymphs were reared at 15, 23 and 30 degrees C until adult emergence, requiring development periods of 50-55, 30-35 and 18-20 days, respectively. The thermal tolerance limits of both age groups changed significantly with acclimation and were correlated with rearing temperature. Across the 48 separate measurements of thermal tolerance (CTmin, CCT, CTmax, HCT, LLT50 and ULT50 of nymphs and adult males and females), the temperature differential across the three indices of cold tolerance after acclimation at 15 degrees C compared with a population maintained at 23 degrees C were between 0.5-2.8 and 2.9-5.0 degrees C for nymphs and adults, respectively. By comparison, acclimation at 30 degrees C increased heat tolerance in terms of changes in the CTmax, HCT and ULT50, and the temperature differentials compared with the 23 degrees C population were between 1.1-3.3 degrees C for nymphs and 0.3-1.6 degrees C for adults. These data indicate that, under the acclimation regimes applied to N. lugens, increases in cold tolerance were greater than heat tolerance.},

	abstract = {Quantifying a species thermal tolerance is critical to assessing biological impacts of anticipated increases in temperature (e.g., climate change). Although many studies have documented the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of fish, there is a paucity of research on thermal biology of sturgeon. The shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum LeSueur, 1818) is a threatened species that exists along the eastern coast of North America. They can be exposed to temperatures ranging from freezing to above 25 degrees C. Using a heating rate of 6 degrees C/h, CTmax and the associated hematological responses of shortnose sturgeon acclimated to 10, 15, and 20 degrees C were determined. There was a significant positive relationship between CTmax and body mass, and CTmax increased significantly with increases in acclimation temperature (T-a). In general, hematology of thermally stressed fish was modified relative to control (nonstressed) fish. Hematocrit, plasma lactate, and plasma Na+ and Cl- of fish were all significantly influenced by thermal stress and T-a. Glucose and K+ were only significantly influenced by thermal stress. Future studies should address the importance of other stressors, such as salinity and toxicants, on thermal relationships of sturgeon.},

Highest mean CT maximum and lowest mean CT minimum measured over these acclimation temperatures were 40.3 and 2.7 degrees C (catfish), 38.5 and 3.2 degrees C (bass) and 29.8 and similar to 0.0 degrees C (trout). Temperature tolerance data were precise with standard deviations generally less than 0.5 degrees C. Channel catfish had the largest thermal tolerance scope of the three species while rainbow trout had the lowest tolerance of high temperatures and the highest tolerance of low temperatures. In all species CT minima and CT maxima were highly significantly linearly related to acclimation temperature. Within each species, slopes relating CT maxima to acclimation temperature were approximately half as large as those relating CT minima to acclimation temperature, suggesting that acclimation temperature has a greater influence on tolerance to low rather than high temperatures. Slopes relating both CT minima and CT maxima to acclimation temperature fdr the two warm-water species were similar and approximately twice those for the rainbow trout.},

	abstract = {Sterile insect release (SIR) is used to suppress insect pest populations in agro-ecosystems, but its success hinges on the performance of the released insects and prevailing environmental conditions. For example, low temperatures dramatically reduce SIR efficacy in cooler conditions. Here, we report on the costs and benefits of thermal acclimation for laboratory and field responses of codling moth, Cydia pomonella. Using a component of field fitness, we demonstrate that low temperature acclimated laboratory-reared moths are recaptured significantly more (∼2-4×) under cooler conditions in the wild relative to warm-acclimated or control moths. However, improvements in low temperature performance in cold-acclimated moths came at a cost to performance under warmer conditions. At high ambient temperatures, warm-acclimation improved field performance relative to control or cold-acclimated moths. Laboratory assessments of thermal activity and their limits matched the field results, indicating that these laboratory assays may be transferable to field performance. This study demonstrates clear costs and benefits of thermal acclimation on laboratory and field performance and the potential utility of thermal pretreatments for offsetting negative efficacy in SIR programmes under adverse thermal conditions. Consequently, the present work shows that evolutionary principles of phenotypic plasticity can be used to improve field performance and thus possibly enhance pest control programmes seeking increased efficacy. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to characterize the variability of thermal tolerances between life-history stages of the invasive Belonesox belizanus and attempt to describe the most likely stage of dispersal across south Florida. In the laboratory, individuals were acclimated to three temperatures (20, 25, or 30°C). Upper and lower lethal thermal limits and temperatures at which feeding ceased were measured for neonates, juveniles, and adults. Thermal tolerance polygons were developed to represent the thermal tolerance range of each life-history stage. Results indicated that across acclimation temperatures upper lethal thermal limits were similar for all three stages (38°C). However, minimum lethal thermal limits were significantly different at the 30°C acclimation temperature, where juveniles (9°C) had an approximately 2.0°C and 4.0°C lower minimum lethal thermal limit compared with adults and neonates, respectively. According to thermal tolerance polygons, juveniles had an average tolerance polygonal area almost 20°C2 larger than adults, indicating the greatest thermal tolerance of the three life-history stages. Variation in cessation of feeding temperatures indicated no significant difference between juveniles and adults. Overall, results of this study imply that juvenile B. belizanus may be equipped with the physiological flexibility to exercise habitat choice and reduce potential intraspecific competition with adults for limited food resources. Given its continued dispersal, the minimum thermal limit of juveniles may aid in continued dispersal of this species, especially during average winter temperatures throughout Florida where juveniles could act to preserve remnant populations until seasonal temperatures increase. © 2012 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.},
